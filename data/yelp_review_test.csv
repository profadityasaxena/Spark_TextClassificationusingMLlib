8226,4,The people that work here are amazing. All of them. They're not only friendly but they take care things. Great experience every time.
36026,2,"The boba drink was terrible, but the shaved ice was good."
48918,2,"My expectations may be too high...let's start off with the positives.  Big parking lot, modern decor and very spacious.  Great service for having only one person running the front of the house.   \n\nWe ordered chicken red curry, papaya salad, BBQ chicken, pad thai and a side order of sweet rice.\n\nSweet rice - soggy and over cooked.  It came in a plastic sandwich bag.\n\nBBQ chicken - it was served with a side of the sweet chili sauce...bottled chili sauce.  The chicken is a piece of chicken breast marinated in what seemed like dried curry rub.  It was not BBQ nor did it taste like BBQ. It tasted pan fried.  Overall, I did not like it.\n\nPapaya salad - a bit too salty without the lime flavor.  Tiny bits of dried peanuts mixed throughout the salad....wasn't authentic, very Americanized.\n\nChicken red curry - loved the bamboo shoots and normal curried vegetables in the dish however the curry sauce lacked flavor.  It was very bland and no taste...it could've used a dash of fish sauce.  Overall, it was ok.\n\nPad thai - I was over it prior to making my way towards this dish.  My kids absolutely LOVED it!  That says it all as my kids are very picky eaters with a sophisticated palette.\n\nWould I return? Likely not and still in search for authentic Thai cuisine in AZ!"
35478,4,Very clean and comfortable poker room. The best in Vegas! Be sure to order the cappuccino with the swizzle stick sugar.. sooo good. Also they have all kinds of delicious drinks here :)
39009,4,"One of my new favorite places.  The food is so delicious and reasonably priced and the staff is really friendly.  The music / television can be a bit loud but it is a bar so I can't really complain about it.  I like the Mill Ave location better for people watching on the patio.  Both places are dog friendly!\n\nEverything I've tried is fresh and delicious.  I love their ceviche tostadas, salsa, chips and guac to start, but we've also had the corn dip and it's pretty good.  The tacos are all yummy, and the house salad is really good.  I haven't tried anything I didn't like.  The servers are friendlier than I would expect and that's been consistent so they hire well.\n\nNot sure I would've tried this place based purely on appearances and the bar atmosphere because it's not really our style, but the food keeps bringing us back.  I love it for lunch or an early dinner."
14646,2,"This review is for the weekend brunch buffet - it gets high marks for presentation but low marks for food.  I always think that for the money the food should be better.  \n\nIt is a really nice looking buffet - the main courtyard atrium is lovely and the dessert room is stunning but I find that most of them don't taste as good as they look.\n\nThere are some really standout items at this buffet - the lox is yummy and plentiful, the super thick cut bacon is fantastic, and the soy gelato (raspberry and mint chip flavors) was outstanding.  The warm mini sticky buns in the desert section next to the bread pudding were great. The fresh squeezed orange juice is fabulous!  My friends really enjoyed the congee but congee isn't my thing so I can't comment on that. \n\nThere are also things that are just ok - the pancake station doesn't actually allow you to put the various options IN the pancakes - just on top. The chocolate chips were good and melted properly but I had my heart set on some blueberry pancakes and they didn't have any fresh blueberries.  The lobster quiche had some nice pieces of lobster but the quiche itself was just kind of Blegh.\n\nI always look for chocolate croissants (one of my favorite food items on earth) but they have a surprising lack of breakfast bread/ pastry items (considering the giant room of deserts which I think go hand in hand).\n\nNo oysters, no crab legs, the salmon filets were dry as a bone and tremendously over cooked.\n\nOur waiter wasn't around much but our busboy was very obliging in bringing us more orange juice. If it weren't for him I would have subtracted another star."
3195,4,Amazing happy hour! Spendy but not at happy hour.
4945,0,Very expensive tourist trap. The food is pure crap.
23173,2,"Rolled up late afternoon looking for some steak action. I was a bit skeptical seeing the 3.5 star rating. And my presumptions proved to be true =\\. The empty restaurant should've been the first clue- but then again, who the hell eats a big ass steak for lunch? WE DO! Apparently (-_-)\n\nAfter the rude-ass hostess out in front sat us down, we were curious to try out this highly touted \""BBL\"" beef, so we all ordered the 16 oz bone-in new yeezy. Disappointing for $61 duckets. Good size, good cut, looked good but I expected a little more as far as flavoring. I ordered medium rare but that shit was literally still mooing when I got it.  After taking a few bites I noticed that subtle dry aged beef flavor - hard to describe, it sorta had that rotten cheese kinda taste towards the end. I'm not that hardcore of a steak connoisseur to know if it was supposed to taste like that or if that's a good thing or not, but all I know is that I didn't particularly favor it.\n\nWe also ordered the Italian Broccoli with smoked pork at the recommendation of our server- that was actually pretty good. I'm not sure if I'd shell out the kind of duckets to come back here again. For that kinda money I'd much rather go to a sure win like R. Chris or Mortons. (-_-)"
40718,1,"A/c broken tonight, now I see it was broken 10 days ago.  Wth?  It didn't help that they sat us next to a huge window that was baking in the 90-degree heat. Margarita was ok, guacamole was tasteless.  I couldn't get out of there soon enough; we found someplace else for dinner. Everyone was complaining about the heat, but no manager talked to any of the tables. Bush league. Won't be back."
22716,3,"i was only outside but the outside was beautiful. a little confusing to drive around, but a ton of little restaurants and shops. super cute."
38779,4,"Pros: Friendly staff, great service - laser here is a pretty painless procedure. Easy to set an appointment to your liking. They are thorough and quick (so I'm usually in and out in under 20 minutes - although I'm only doing a small area, other areas and larger areas might take longer). Clean facility and clean machinery. Little to no wait time, max maybe 5 minutes. \n\nCons: The first time I went in the technician put me at a low setting and it didn't do anything for me. Luckily the second time I went in the technician noticed that the setting was too low the first time and wanted me to see results, so asked if it were alright to bump up the setting. She apologized for the other technician's mistake.\n\nOther than that, I would say overall it's been a good experience. They are priced at what you'd expect not cheap, but not over-priced. Would definitely recommend."
4160,1,"We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone."
8474,0,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! The service was so terrible, first of all the manager as soon as we walked in was rude my sister in law walked I front of him by accident and he goes \""EXCUSE ME!\"" In a more than necessary rude tone. And then our server didnt know anything you would've thought it was his first hour. Point blank horrible service and was a very bad choice service wise for Mother's Day. Although the food was tasty the service made me never wanna ever wanna go back."
17585,2,"This casino is nice, but it's soooo far from the strip unless you plan to stay entirely at this resort it's hardly worth staying.  The amenities are pretty nice though, it's clean and new.  I had a problem with the wireless, the room kept saying I wasn't properly checked in and had to call several technicians who finally said that all the rooms were down and would be fixed in a couple of hours.  The next morning it hadn't been fixed yet and so I asked to move rooms.  Voila!  The other rooms were working.  Otherwise a very nice hotel and resort to stay at, the pool is beautiful and they have some good restaurants.  But if you're planning to go anywhere near the strip, I'd reconsider."
12308,0,"We had a partial lake view room in the spa tower.....\n\nThe Good.....\n1. Beautiful common areas\n2. Free\n3. The amenities rocked!!  In addition to the normal stuff, they also included hairspray, a toothbrush, bath salts and a loofa. (I am not sure if we were given extra stuff because we were on a suite floor or if this is usual)\n4. The Buffet (Yum!!)\n5. View of Paris from our room at night was stunning\n6. Fountain show\n7. (Steam) shower was large and had good water pressure\n8. Bose clock radio\n\nThe Bad.....\n1. Crowded common areas\n2. The room we reserved was sold out so we were downgraded\n3. Customer service was a little suspect; none of the employees went out of thier way to smile or be helpful \n4. The view of City Center from our room.  Yuck!!\n5. The room in the spa tower had two beds and one chair.  Only one of us could sit and watch the lake show at a time comfortably.  Seriously, could they not have put a second chair in the room?\n6. The toilet faces the shower and there isn't that much space between the two. This seemed like a bad layout.\n7. They piled the pillows in shams and the duvets that they (probably) use on the beds in the room.  (This is where the extra chairs should have been.) They never actually made the bed with these items durring our stay.  \n8. Television was small, had bad sound and was dated - 27 inch rear projection.  \n\nOverall, I don't think we would pay to stay in this hotel because we always felt that we were an after thought. We stayed at GVR and Palazzo during this trip and thought that there rooms were much nicer in those two hotels and we were treated much more kindly at both of those hotels."
29651,3,"Habanero burger ftw!! it's just so uncomfortably blue in there. I dont understand why they chose to design the building that way...at least leave the windows clear ya know? Despite the literally sickening atmosphere, the food is pretty good. The meat is cooked to order, the sauces are distinct, and the sweet potatoes fries are pretty bomb. Overall, I think its a good place for burgers...just would sit outside if i could next time."
8561,0,We had to put our own tables together to accommodate our party of 8.  The service was very slow.  The server was forgetful.  AND... The Chicken California flatbread pizza gave my wife food poisoning!
35298,1,"This show was overpriced, performance was mediocre, had very little real dancing and had a bit too much immature sexual insinuation (guys grabbing their crotch too often) and mime comedy. Throughout the whole show, we kept waiting for the real show and exciting performance to start.  It never did. There was one number like it.  Everything else did not have the caliber of their performance on ABDC. \n\nBut while walking out, someone exclaimed, \""it was sooooo good.\""  My husband and I wondered if we were in the same show.  Maybe it's more for the teenage crowd."
34074,0,"I recently stayed at Cancun Resort in Las Vegas, and attended a Diamond resorts sales presentation with Ricky Poyner.  The overall presentation was pleasant although Ricky,  the salesman deliberately lied about them checking my credit.  He mentioned several times that they don't check credit. Immediately following the presentation, I received a notification of an inquiry from Diamond International on my credit report. \nI'm confused?  Did the salesman deliberately LIE to me? \n\nIs this a business of INTEGRITY?  Had we known that attending the presentation would be an inquiry on our credit,  we could have decided whether or not to proceed. That choice was not given to us.\n\nI don't believe this was a training issue because the salesman said several times, \""we will not check your credit.\""\n\nI have sent a complaint and awaiting a response"
28508,4,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. We tried this place after the Concierge from the Montelucia Intercontinental suggested it. When we drove up the place was not very crowded so we were a bit worried. During our meal the placed filled up and after we were done I know why. Hands down a great place. The service was excellent, our server was cheerful, friendly, and attentive. She explained the menu for us and was really great. The margaritas we delicious and the chips were fresh, salsa was incredible. \nTry this place you'll love it"
46529,1,"Ya, OK, it is a adult toy store right.. Sometimes I want to go look at things I might buy on Amazon.. Seriously. This store is a bit over priced, they all are in my opinion, anywho.. I just want to snoop around in stores like this, I have no interest in chatting it up with the sales staff. SERIOUSLY, if I need your help I will ask. \n\nSo I walk in and the sales staff says hi, I say hi and move on in.. now she is following me..\""Is there anything I can help you find?\"" Nope, I'm good... She is still on me, \""Well we have x and y and this and that\"" Uh, ya thanks I'm good.. SERIOUSLY? I have a rough idea of whats in here, leave me alone sheeesh!\n\nThe sales staff is inappropriate and nosy, unless you like to feel like you have stepped onto a used car lot from the 1980's... come on people a bit of decorum! UUGGHHH.. Will not be back..\n\nHowever, if you have zero idea of what to do with the things you find in here, I am pretty sure the sales staff could give you detailed instructions ANNOYING.."
11331,2,"I'm not really sure how I feel about this place yet. I got the chili rellenos, and didn't really care for them...they had a funny windex flavored aftertaste. My hubby really liked his carne asada burrito though. They have a pretty wide variety of things you can order, so I'm willing to give this place another try. I really liked the green salsa (lots of garlic), the red was pretty average. The prices are reasonable. My hubby's burrito was big and full of steak that he really liked. I'll post again and re-rate after I try something else from here :) So, for now it can get a middle of the road."
15212,1,The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional.  Sat for 20min never came back to take our order. Food didn't taste good. It was too salty.
38448,0,"I took my parents in law to this place, and so disappointed and even embarrassed. This restaurant was ok until my last visit, summer 2011. However they came up with this strange concept to \""target people other than Koreans.\"" Decoration of food was ok, but quality and taste were poor. We ordered non-marinated galbi and they gave us 8 small pieces on a bamboo leaf(for deco i assume). It wasnt the galbi we usually see in a korean bbq place, but it looked like the short rib u can buy from Costco for twenty bucks per pack (which can give you more than 50 pieces). They charged around 15 dollars for that 8 pieces. HEY REMEMBER. KOREAN FOOD IS GOOD AND DELICIOUS WHEN ITS KOREAN FOOD ITSELF."
36750,0,"I wish I could rate the food, but we didn't even get a chance to try so full disclosure only rating the service. We made a reservation a day before, get to the restaurant and it was clear by the hostess' reaction they weren't expecting us. It was clear they made a makeshift table for our party...in the hallway. \n\nThere were people coming and going and it felt we were in their way. My dad had politely requested a clearly open table, and was told it had already been reserved for a larger table. The table stayed open for a while, only to be filled by a party our exact same size. \n\nAfter seeing this my dad again, politely, requested a table that wasn't in the middle of the hallway. We were eventually told they could accommodate us, then we waited. And waited and waited some more. We ended up waiting an hour and sipped on cheap yet overpriced wine. We finally had enough and then packed our things and left when we realized not only would we not be moved to another table we were purposely not going to be served because of our table request. \n\nWe left an hour after we were \""seated\"" in the hallway. When we let the manager and hostess know we were leaving, without making any sort of scene, they threw their hands up in the air emphatically as if to insinuate our leaving was our own problem. \n\nWe left, went to I heart burgers instead and had a fabulous, low key night with delightful food and wonderful service. And most importantly we actually were seated and treated like human beings. Moral of the story: overpriced food and horrible service, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"
45035,1,"Great doughnuts - poor customer service.\n\nI've been here a few times and the doughnuts are great!!  Unfortunately the last time I was there the service was horrible, and that is putting is nicely.  I walked in and the guy was helping another couple, but then after getting their order and telling them it would be about a 15min wait he continued to \""chit chat\"" and make small talk, which is fine but he did not even acknowledge I was standing there for about 5min!!\nFinally another lady came out and asked if she could help me, she was nice enough but when I ordered she straight told me - we don't have those.  Now I'm not sure if she meant we don't have those as in we are out right now or we don't make those.  Now I ordered the 3 strawberry shortcake and 3 banana cream - which I have had in the past, so as I looked at her confused and at their display, she said well, let me check. She walked in the back and said it would be one hour!!  I couldn't fathom as to why the people in front of me, who also ordered specialty doughnuts, would be only 15min and my order would be one hour.  As I was already there I decided to wait.  I ordered a coffee and saw they had vanilla - empty (now the same guy that ignored me is right there and says nothing), so I just get regular coffee.  Another lady tried the vanilla and yup still empty. This time the guy says \""oh I have more in the back let me get it - it'll be about 15min\"".  REALLY WTF had i somehow gained the super power of invisibility and this guy does not see me!!!!!\n\nSad to say I will not be going back in the foreseeable future - maybe if I feel like being ignored I'll go back."
7151,2,Heaven for vegan . \nStay away from the meat. \nGreat desserts. \nTake the Turkish coffee.
18792,4,"Drove by this place on the way back from a meeting. Checked it out on Yelp decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. They give you 3 different salsas and chips the minute you're seated at the table. All are very good. \n\nTried the Pollo Fundido, as so many on Yelp had recommended it. It lived up to the reviews. I will say this, though, it is not a light lunch by any means. Eat this baby at noon, and you'll be snoozing by 2 PM in your chair at the office. \n\nMany things in the menu looked tasty. Wish I were in the area more often so I could try the rest."
33649,1,"While looking at replacing some toilets, we stopped by Lowe's to check the prices. The question I asked the chipper employer, while pointing at a specific toilet was, \""Is this the only one piece toilet you have?\"" She responded, \""No. We have lots of toilets,\"" as she pointed to the row of two piece toilets. I repeated my question, \""Is this the only one piece toilet you have?\"" Her response, \""Do you want a one piece toilet?\"" No, genius, I'm asking for my health.... This left me super frustrated so we left."
26463,1,"** Splitting this review into two parts! My rating coincides more so to the Ovation venue than Steel Panther itself! **\n\nOVATION (REASON FOR TWO STARS): Let me just say I'm not quite sure what the goal was for the door people, but they were only letting 2-4 people in at a time the night I went to see Steel Panther. There was still a line outside even when the show was halfway well over, and I couldn't imagine how the people at the end of the line were feeling when the doormen were literally trickling people in 2 at a time for the show. It was a free show, but then again the doormen were doing it for the purpose of getting a couple extra bucks in their pockets, to which that in itself made me instantly give this place a 2 because how are you going to panhandle locals like that, in a local casino, with a free show?! Besides from the not so great service from the doormen, the venue is small, but caters enough to the crowd that comes there.\n\nSTEEL PANTHER (FOUR STARS!): Free show, and these guys are hilarious! There's a possibility for them to pull you up on stage to jam out with them/take part in their ridiculous skits, so I would advise to dress super glam and get drunk if you want to get pulled up on stage with them (the more outrageous you are with them, the better!) They cover a lot of the 80s based rock (hence their look and theme), but these guys crack jokes at the typical stereotypes of rock and roll. Each show is unique, so expect something completely different every time."
3583,1,"I let my experience here simmer for a long time. I kept putting off writing a review because I did not want to offend anyone...but after getting a few good haircuts again I decided to vent and write a review...after all doesn't a good yelper write about the good...and the not so good?\n\nI went to this place based on the great yelp reviews. I made an appointment for a haircut and color.\n\nLets start with the color...she left it on for (I felt like) a very long time. After the color was washed out I touched my hair and already felt a ton of breakage. I mean pieces of hair were just coming off in my fingers. I don't know what happened...if it was left on for too long or the color was too strong...but my hair had never been that damaged before. Also...the color was just not what I asked for...the highlights were very chunky and unnatural and the brown faded super fast. \n\nAs far as the cut went...I had a super cute haircut that I got in LA that just needed to be trimmed up again. Instead it was just made to look like a \""soccer mom\"" cut. Chucks of hair were cut that just did not need to be. When I went back to my hair guy in LA he remarked...\""wow....you were really hacked into weren't you\"".\n\nThe salon was nice...but I was just not happy with my haircut or color."
9372,4,"I just love the Golden Gate. This place is for all of us who think the Strip is a bit too flashy. Its a hole in the wall casino with a couple craps tables, ten or so blackjack tables, and a small section of slots. \n\nAt night it gets to be a lot of fun with the cheap limits on the tables and go-go girls. I was here with three friends and we definitely let ourselves get drawn into their game (you know the one where they fake flirt with the customers in order to get you to stick around and drop more money gambling), but didn't mind cause we were having drinks on the house and its Vegas so you should enjoy the cheesy things in life like faux-flirting go-go girls!\n\nThe Pit bosses were also very nice and would come around and ask if everything was alright and made sure we were having a good time."
45372,1,"The prices here are really high for what you get & poor service. $9 for a 6 ounce margarita, my friend's was so salty we had to send it back. The bartender had difficulty promoting & describing the drinks off the margarita menu.\n\nOnce we got seated at a table, the server stopped by to greet us so we ordered waters and a sprite, she said she was gonna go bus a table and come back for our drink order. Mind you no one was waiting at the door for a table.\n\nNext my friends wanted charro beans with their fish, the were out, so they settled for the black beans. A few minutes later the waitress came by to say the walk in fridge has a latch problem and was left open last night and the black beans are not tasting right, so she recommended the rice. After that we all look at each other and said \"" I wonder what else was bad in the cooler, I don't think she should have told us that\"".\n\nMy friend got a steak burro for $9 and it was go small with nothing else, she only ate half & said it was only ok. I bet you can get a better burro at Chipolte.\n\nMy other friends had swami in foil, customarily the waitress should open it for you but she didn't. My friends really enjoyed the fish.\n\nThis place needs some work on service, quality and value for your money."
30592,4,Good yogurt! Very clean establishment and fair prices. The quality of the product is good. The flavor is great. Three of us ate there for just about $11 which isn't bad.
3280,3,"Some of the fellas (and one lady) from work tapped me on the shoulder and said that they were headed here for lunch.  I drove over there to meet them and to try out some pizza.  They have a great deal M-F for lunch.... 2 slices cheese and a drink for only $4.10!   Can't beat that!  The pizza was good...crisped up in the oven nice.  The cheese looked a tad greasy but it was not...no puddles to be found anywhere.  The sauce was just alright but the crust made up for it.  Really good crust! The slices were really big too!  Score!   Service was to the point, not friendly, not rude but you could tell that they were appreciative for your business.  It's only a mile or so from work so I'm sure I will be back for that killer lunch special.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food too!"
21002,2,Sushi was just ok. I agree with other reviews that the spam hand roll is a good deal for $0.99! Their tamago/egg hand roll also same price and was pretty yummy. My husband go the combination BBQ and found that the chicken was way better than the beef BBQ. Get the chicken! Spicy tuna and unagi was pretty good. Will be back & maybe next time I'll use their delivery service :)
22755,0,"The one in Yuma, AZ was better. I had honey BBQ wings for appetizer, which were OK at best. For dinner had black and bleu burger. Didnt read menu close enuff, I guess. For $9 I got a \""slider\"" with bleu cheese dressing squirted on it. The bun was tastey...more of a dinner roll, actually. The burger was disgusting....like it was baked or microwaved or somthing. Service was friendly but slow. Took them 5 minutes to make a gin/tonic while at 40% capacity. The only thing that will drag me back into one of these restaurants is a mandatory work function. A shame since I really wanted to like this place."
384,1,"The entrance is hard to find/identify... the exit says Sears, but the entrance has a door that says Avis/Budget.  You have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys.  Waiting in line took roughly 20 minutes on a Tuesday about 12 noon.  \n\nI brought my car in for a simple oil change.. it took almost 3 hours.  Granted when they told me it was done, there were several things that Diego had found that I could fix in my car.. the list of repairs totaled over $800.  I didn't bring the car in for an inspection, just an oil change.. that's all I wanted.. could have saved time elsewhere.  It was about $40 for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon.\n\nThey assured me that the fluids (windshield washer, power steering, etc.) would be topped off; I checked in the parking lot afterwards and it was not done.  I was so fed-up with waiting so long that I didn't feel the need to wait even more."
20334,0,"I wish my experiences with this restaurant were like the other reviewers. I had my food delivered. I had a small peporoni pizza and a philly combo sandwich.

If you like salt then you can't go wrong with this place!! If you can imagine eating a salt sandwich or a salt slice of pizza you have experienced what I experienced when I ate the food from here!! I will give them a \""decent\"" (meaning digestible) rating on the fries and cake, otherwise this place gets a thumbs down with Shaquille Oneal's hands!!!...lol..Horrfible!!!...However, the delivery was fast!!!. But even that was flawed as he didn't have his charge card machine and I had to call in my credit card info outside of my apt bldg. for all the world to hear!!!...lol..Thank God my credit limit is extraordinarily low on the card I used, or I would have had to worry about I.d. scammers besides an upset stomach with what little I did \""manage\"" to swalow!! ...lol..proceed at your own risk!!!...lol"
22553,2,"Its really the first magic show I have experienced in this scale.  The show tickets were like $20 bucks so there was not much to lose. There were some pretty cool tricks but it did feel sometimes like Dirk Arthur stood a little too long waiting for an applause.  Cheaply priced show, had a few tigers, made a helicopter appear. I went to the 4pm show and the theater was half empty.  It isnt very big to begin with.  Overall ok show.  If you are on a budget definitely go watch it, woull get your money's worth.  Next time I will go to Vegas I will try Lance Burton's show or Rick Thomas though."
7972,2,"While waiting to be seated at this neat Old Town location, I was reading the notes left by patrons. There were several that stated things like the best Mexican food in Phoenix, Best Mexican food ever. The food is good, not the best I ever had, I would rate it in the top ten Mexican places I have eaten at. I had the pork steak and it was done very good, moist juicy, with a really nice spice rub on it. Lots of food for the price. Salsa Fresca, Beans, Rice and tortilla. House Margarita was just so so. I would go back and I would recommend if you are in the Phoenix Metro area. They don't do separate checks, which sucks if you need an individual receipt for expense accounts."

I wish there was a separate listing for the restaurant but according to the receipt, it falls under the same name and address.  \nI had passed by the marketplace many times and never stopped there but on this recent trip to Vegas, I was finally curious enough to go in.  I was also hungry, so when I saw the Chinese restaurant, I decided to get the 2 item combo (4.99).\nThis seemed like the typical pre-prepared Chinese food type of place, like a Panda Express, so I wasn't expecting gourmet food but still something half-way decent.\nWell, this place exceeded all expectations...in a bad way.  From the first bite, I could tell this food was something \""special\"", something so gross and disgusting that I could barely force myself to try a second bite.  Just for reference, I've eaten my share of iffy food and filled myself many times at cheap Chinese food buffets so I don't have unrealistic expectations.\nWell, this food was probably the worst I've had that I can recall.  The chow mein was greasy, the chicken was tough and they both seemed like they were cooked at least a day before if not much longer...in rancid oil that should have been discarded a week before.  The meat tasted as if it came from chickens dead of old age or disease...or at least what I imagine those taste like.\nEven if I could have fought back the gagging and swallowed it, I was too afraid of the expected digestive and perhaps other health effects to even attempt it.\nSilly me, I was so outraged at this revolting food being served that I asked for a refund even though I was almost certain I would not be given one.  \nWell, of course, I was not given one.  The kind of business who serves this kind of food does not exactly care about customer satisfaction.\nNow, I usually hate wasting food but tossed this in the trash with no hesitation.  Then again, this could hardly be worthy of the name \""food.\""\nThere is no reason to eat here when there is much better cheap food to be had in Vegas."
9530,4,"REVIEW OF THE GIFT SHOP: The store is packed with cute things you won't be able to find anywhere else. Collectible Disney figurines, precious stuffed animals, travel goods, etc. The gift shop is worth the trip to the hospital! If you are looking for something specific, the hospital volunteers are always available by phone to help you out. Items can even be purchased over the phone if you are trying to send something to a patient in the hospital. The flowers are fresh and can be sent up to the rooms as well. The flower prices are significantly lower than ordering from an outside vendor! Gift-wrapping is available."
25225,0,"I had a horrible experience dining here.  The food was really bad!!!  I order the calamari to start - it came as a huge plate of fried squid...granted, that is what I had ordered, but it was a bit over the top.  I only ate about a third of it.  It would be great if the halfed the portion of this and lowered the price (pretty pricey appetizer of $16).  \n\nThe worst part was my main course.  Ordered the linguine with clam sauce and it was the WORST pasta I have ever tasted.  Even Olive Garden and Chef Boyardee are better than this pasta.  It was so incredibly bland it was like they forgot the white wine for the white wine sauce.  I couldnt' believe what I was tasting and asked my husband to try to make sure I wasn't crazy.  He shared the same sentiments so I sent it back.  Next I asked for the Roasted Shrimp Penne which was okay...at least it had some taste to it, but I have had much better.  Given the prices, the food was VERY mediocre.  I think I would have enjoyed my time more at Maggiano's across the street.\n\nA huge disappointment....we are regulars at the Wynn and Encore, and this has been my only negative dining experience at this hotel (all the other restaurants are great - SW Steakhouse, Okada, Switch, Wazuzu, Red 8, Bartolotta, etc)"
111,2,"D's does the chicago style hot dog very well, they even use sport peppers which I can never find in the grocery store. The bun is steamed and features the quintessential poppy seed exterior.\n\nD's beer selection is also great but I'm not much of a beer drinker so it's not something I've ever focused on. The general consensus I've heard is that there is better selection elsewhere and the prices are a little high but you can't beat both their hot dogs and their beer selection at the same time, making them a great bar.\n\nTheir fries are so crispy that I suspect they're double fried. They're tasty and the toppings available can turn them into a bastard concoction of delicious, artery clogging glory. There's been nothing on D's menu that I've been disappointed with.\n\nThe service can be a little hit or miss due mostly to the sheer amount of business they do on a Friday or Saturday night."

They first gave us the wrong room that was already occupied, then had to go back down to get a new room. Parking was horrible, had to end up parking at Harrahs. The rooms are filthy. The carpet has stains, and the furniture is tore up. The whole room smells bad. It was so bad, that by 7:30 that same morning we left to go stay in another hotel. But that is not all. I never thought that I would ever see a Caesars Entertainment Property have duct tape holding down the seams of the carpet in the hallway. Wow!!! I contacted the hotel once I got home, and below is their reply:\n\nDear Mr. XXXXXX,\n\nThank you for contacting The Quad and making us aware of your experience. Your comments are appreciated as it enables us to identify what we are doing correctly to satisfy our guests, as well as, discovering where adjustments can be made so we may continue providing the best products and service.\n\nLet me begin by saying that I certainly understand your frustrations. We all set expectations before we travel and certainly the type of room that we will receive is one of those. I was disappointed to hear we were unable to meet your expectations with the room you received during your visit and apologize for any inconvenience. As a mature hotel, it is challenging to keep our product fresh and up to our brand standards, however, there is absolutely no excuse for you not to receive a room that affords you the comforts of home.

Please be assured that our main goal at The Quad is to provide the finest in accommodations, products, and service to you, our valued guests.

20041,0,"It really takes a lot to agitate me and yet the girl(s) at Rebel Oil #66 on the corner of Decatur and Flamingo managed to do just that.  I went in for gas.  The card reader at the pump was not working so I went in to pay for my gas.  There are two girls standing behind the counter talking ane one doing some type of inventory in front of the counter.  They ignore me for nearly 3 minutes.  Now you may be saying,,, \""Come on, its only three minutes\"" but when you are the only one other than the three of them standing there it seems like an eternity.  No \""Hello\"", \""I will be right with you\"" Nothing.  They just kept talking to each other and refused to acknowledge me until I cleared my throat.  All I got was a look.  No greeting, no inquiry, no nothing she just gave me the \""What do you want?\"" look.  So I ask for my gas, she rings it in and I walk back to my car.  No salutation,,,, nothing,  Just the look of irratation that I had interupted her morning coffee conversation with her coworker.  I am sure it was important and had something to do with cold fusion, world peace, molecular chemistry or something like that.  (Insert sarcasm here).  I get to the pump and low and behold.... nothing.  The pump wont turn on.  I go back in.  Still no inquiry what so ever so I say. \""I am not getting anything on the pump\"".  She goes over to the register and a few seconds later spouts out  \""Ok, go ahead\"".  Wow, she actually does speak.  Back to the pump.  Same problem.  I go back in.  I ask if they can just change my pump number.  She says \""Did you hit the green button?\""  (No, dumbass, you did not tell me I had to hit the freaking green button.) Since fairness is always in order this time I did not say anything I just turned around and walked back to the pump.  I finally get my gas and as I pull out the first thing in my mind is I am going to rip this joint on Yelp!  \nYou would think that with the hundreds of gas stations around (a lot with cheaper gas), the people working in them would make at least a tiny effort to be polite and friendly.  I guess Rebel Oil #66 on Decatur and Flamingo does not think that is necessary.  \n\nJoin my quest and get your gas somewhere else please."

She took her time and did a great job! She definitely wanted me to leave there happy and i definitely did. She made sure that i was getting the best haircut possible. We had good conversation with Danny also. \n\nI read a review that said that they try to get out of there as fast as possible and that definitely is not the case. The shop closed at 5 today and i was in there till 7:30. They took every one of us and the best part was Stephanie and Danny didn't seem in a hurry. They were happy to do it!\n\nI again, recommend this place to everyone! Great haircuts, great conversation, and a great environment."

Service is appalling, food quality is dirt poor (except for the wings), everything is filthy, and the hospitality, overall, is terrible.  A week ago I went in; it started the season off on a bad note... I even called the manager over to explain that I am a loyal customer and hadn't seen it this bad EVER.  He didn't have much to say as I gave him some gentle feedback on my experiences, he didn't even apologize or thank me for my loyal business.  I pledged to myself I will never drop another nickel in that place again after that.  Not even for a DIE HARD Packer fan..."
45851,2,Awesome little vegan diner! Everything on the menu is vegan except they do offer eggs.. I came here around 7pm and ordered the French toast.. Delicious! \n\nNow this is why i only ranked them 3 stars..\nMy friend and I shared the nachos.. Between the 2 of us we could barley eat half of it because it was lacking soooo much... My suggestion.. Real pico de gallo and more beans preferably black beans.. I've been vegan for many years and have tried my fair share of vegan cheeses.. The nacho cheese they used wasn't good.. It made me sick to my stomach after I left.\n\nI will be back next time I'm in the area to try out some of their vegan treats!
38287,4,"Parc Central is fabulous and must be checked out. It's large yet very welcoming. When we first walked in, one of the owners actually gave us a tour. As a New York lover, I absolutely LOVED the large wall photos of Central Park, the unique artwork and the eclectic menu that reminds you of the tasty varietals of food that you can find in the Big Apple. Their menu includes unique cocktails (everything from absinthe to martinis to bloody marys) as well that I plan on going back to check out. I went for some appetizers with a girlfriend but they were both phenomenally tasty and went well with our wine: the goat cheese appetizer and the hummus. The goat cheese dish was delicious and I will order it every time (my favorite cheese). The hummus was different and yummy - made with garbanzo beans instead and combined with truffle shavings, it was delish. Our waitress was well versed in the menu and wines and made great recommendations. She even gave us a sample of a Greek white wine to pair with our appetizers. Parc Central also has multiple flat screens and private rooms. She told us that on the weekend nights they have a DJ. I cannot wait to go back and experience more of this restaurant! Do yourself a favor and check it out!"
20955,0,This place is LITERALLY on top of a nightclub. If you like feeling at 1:52am that you're in the middle of a party scene while laying in bed than this may be the place for you. Unfortunately for me I like to sleep. I will never stay here again.
47403,0,"Worst car rental service I've ever experienced!!! If I could give them a negative rating, I would. We arrived at Charlotte airport and went out to the curbside to await our shuttle to come. After waiting for 30mins, I called Sixt to ask where the shuttle was as I had seen other shuttles drive by MULTIPLE times, yet no Sixt shuttle. The lady on the other end assured me that the shuttle was on its way as she claimed she spoke with the driver who said he was \""wrapping around the airport and would be right there.\"" Well, another 10 minutes later, I called again wondering if the driver had gotten lost, disoriented, in a car accident, or blatantly lied, and again I was reassured the shuttle was on its way and that it should be there any second since their location was literally 5 minutes away from the airport (not sure why it would take so long to get to the airport when you're only 5 minutes away.)\n\nLong story short (kinda), the shuttle FINALLY appeared after 5 phone calls and waiting for over an hour in the freezing cold (this is when there was the huge snow/winter storm). The driver pulls up in an unmarked van (no Sixt logo), and proceeds to just sit in the car, not saying he's with Sixt, not saying anything... Just hanging out in the car, when at this point, there were 4 of us waiting for this \""shuttle\"". One of the gentleman that was waiting with us went up to the van and asked the driver if this was indeed the Sixt shuttle, to which the driver responded yes. We got in the van and literally a 5 minute ride later, we were at the office. Mind you, there were no signs with the name, no logo, nothing. We literally got out in a parking lot that looked almost deserted, other than cars parked there. We entered into a small building and lo-and-behold FINALLY saw a Sixt logo. \n\nThe lady at the front desk was really nice and said she was going to upgrade us since we had to wait so long for the shuttle to come pick us up, which was definitely nice. The car, however, wasn't THAT great. I mean the car itself was a brand new Nissan Ultima so I couldn't really complain much about that... but the smell in the car?! Someone definitely was smoking like a chimney in there -- the smoke smell was so incredibly strong I had to drive with the windows down and the heat blasting so I could at least stand being in the car. Not to mention I opened the arm rest compartment to plug my phone in to charge, and a huge cloud of weed odor came out, so it was back to windows being opened. \n\nI think it's safe to say that I will NEVER EVER book another rental vehicle with Sixt, nor will I ever recommend them to anyone. I guess that's why they're \""Sixt\"" -- because they suck!!!"
27191,2,"Tea is very serious business. I'm actually surprised there are not more tea specialists around. I suppose cheaper tea from supermarkets has become the norm\n\nFor me tea is both zen ceremony, rejuvenator and comfort in warm liquid form (a wee bit like whisky). I really do appreciate tea. Needless to say I appreciate tea shops. I'm more of a green and herbal tea man myself, and Whittard manages to accomodate. \n\nApart from selling tea it also sells tea related gifts like teapots and teaspoons. I quite agre with Anna's assesment. This makes for a great opportunity for presents, especially the fairer sex (plus my Dad). Though I hope one day these gender stereotypes will give way to a universally teapot loving nation.\n\nAs has also been mentioned, the problem with Whittard is that it's pricey. I too often leave with nothing in my hand. Unforunetly this may be because of the previously mentioned supermarket control of the tea market. But I can't help feeling Whittard could stretch itself to be a little less expensive."
42020,3,"We've tried the four cheese pizza, risotto primavera, rigatoni bolognese, bruschetta, burrata and an artichoke ravioli over three visits and I have to say, the food has been excellent each time.  I just had the risotto last night and it was delicious and perfectly cooked.  The oil that they serve with the bread is great too though their bread could use a little work (it's too soft and doughy).  We ordered take out each time so I can't comment on the service.\n\nThe portions are solid and it's pretty inexpensive.  I like the changing menu, it keeps me wanting to check back to see what's new.\n\nMy only complaint is their website...it's tough to navigate and, because their menu changes so frequently, you can't really rely on what they publish before you call in your order.  Be prepared with back up choices."
37254,1,I have loved jimmy john's for about 10 years now and consistently ordered from there in 3 different states that I've lived in. I work a couple blocks down and order from there about once a week. Average wait time is at least a half hour. They NEVER give me napkins. This is small.. but very annoying. To top it off their sandwiches just aren't what I'm used to from jimmy johns. The meat never tastes right. Anyways. I just ordered my last sub from there. It's a sad day
44437,3,"The pho hit me at the right spot after an insane hangover. Also they definitely challenged me with the size of that bubble tea. One problem though, what is up with that tapioca? Either they are not boiling it right or just getting the wrong brand. But with everything else, I am quite satisfied."
37911,3,"Good food, but plan on eating a hot dog later. It was very expensive for the portion size.  However, everything tasted amazing!  We had 2 to 3 tapas per person and each tapa had maybe 3 to 4 bites each and cost between nine and $12.   The cocktails were some of the best we had on our trip.   If you are in the mood to spend $20 on a gin and tonic I highly recommend their signature one.  This is definitely a splurge meal and I would recommend the restaurant just be prepared that the portions are a little bit on the small side."
12654,2,"Just checked out this morning after a 4 night stay.  This is a solid hotel but next time I will stay elsewhere, probably the Bellagio.  The standard rooms are spacious but as others have said here, the bathrooms are TINY.  Closet is very small, too.  The bathrooms are about 5' wide (just wide enough for double sinks) and about 8-9' long.  Tub is just a standard crappy tub with a curved shower bar.  There are nicer bathrooms in low end Marriotts.  The beds were comfy and it's a plus that they had two queens in a room and not doubles.  \n\nOverall the hotel and casino feel a little run down and the clientele leaves a bit to be desired.  I think the Mirage's best days are over."

It had the right taste. nothing spectacular, but just your average philly cheesesteak. I came in here very hungry. and left the place content. and 7.99$ is a good price."
43028,3,"We decided to try this vegetarian Chinese restaurant that opened this past April for lunch immediately prior to flying home.  We parked behind the restaurant on the 2nd level of the plaza and entered through the rear door.  The restaurant is bright, meticulously clean and tastefully decorated.  We were immediately greeted at the door and seated by Mimi who was incredibly cheerful and informative as were both chef/owner Kenny and another server who I believe may have been his wife.  The meal started with complimentary cups of soup - a clear broth with a few vegetables and tofu.  For entrees, we shared the crispy spicy eggplant and spicy crispy beef. Both were delicious, but the \""beef\"" dish, made from tofu, was interesting due to its crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, texture and flavor."

It was pretty short of amazing. Take your pick on cups and get started because once you have the cup, you can just keep coming back for more! \n\nMy all time favorite is the 44 Magnum (190 Octane & Hurricane). A mixture of Orange Juice and Vodka-190 O and the Hurr- is a Strawberry and Rum Daiquiri. Noms, you really feel it in the slushy. You're all thinking that it's cute like something you get from Seven-11, but really it's absolutely delicious and wonderful, especially in that Las Vegas heat! There's a list of most enjoyed mixes, or you can create your own! For a dollar, it's an extra shot in your drink in a test tube. It's cute and a tad bit hard to get the vodka out, so I just waited until I was at the end of my daiquiri before unleashing that shot! \n\nIt's at a continent location, in Mandalay Bay by shopping and hotels and casinos and they take cups and do refills from anywhere. It's the only Fat Tuesday in that general area, since the rest are Evening Call, but it's worth it and the prices are usually under 20$. The refills are like 11$ and under, so not bad not bad. Like a mini alcoholic slushy paying mini bar.\n\nI will be back. And you should come try, especially if you're thirsty.  \n(PS. I wasn't hurting the next time, even with the shots. I probably needed even more!)\nNot to mention, since it is Vegas, they take pretty much most forms of payment in terms of cards and cash!"

This is something that the employees there need to take note of. My boyfriend and I were super hungry our way home from the Fashion Show and Chinatown. Alas, there's a KFC! We ordered, got our food and left, only to find that his meal's side dishes were missing back at home. He was really ticked since the side dishes were what he was most looking forward to, and the KFC was really far and out of the way to have to drive back to get the order corrected.\n\nMy meal was fine, but I wouldn't risk going back there. The employee handling our food was too busy talking to an off duty employee to make sure she had everything right. It was a very typical food order for them and they managed to mess that up? Not coming back to this location."

33834,1,"I purchased a LivingSocial.com voucher of 2 pole dance classes for the price of one.  \n\nThe first pole dance class:  The instructor was more than 15 minutes late; however, she extended the class to make up for lost time.  In addition, she had a very positive and energetic attitude.  This was acceptable.\n\nThe second pole dance class:  The instructor was a no-show.  After having waited 35 minutes, it was assumed the class was to be cancelled.  However, I had a special situation; I was going to be out of town, and the voucher would have already been expired before I returned to Vegas.  Chris, the only person working at the studio, reassured all attendees that he would have the manager call us the following day in regards to rescheduling our pole dance class despite my special situation.  A week went by and still, I had not received a phone call from the manager.  Therefore, I called the studio myself in the calmest tone explaining my situation with the no-show class.  In short, the lady over the phone negated anything Chris told us claiming that \""he wouldn't know anything about the class\"" dishonoring whatever he might have said.  She kept making excuses about the instructor being injured and having to cancel previous classes.  Unfortunately, I find it UNPROFESSIONAL ON THE STUDIO'S PART TO NOT NOTIFY IT'S CLIENTS ABOUT A CANCELLED CLASS especially when this was the only time to fulfill my second voucher.  I made an effort to show up and therefore, should be honored a rescheduled class.    \n\nOverall, some staff members are cordial like the student teacher, Chris, and dance pole instructor, Becks, while others such as the manager, Gracie Martinez, are not.  Gracie lacks a positive attitude and has extremely poor customer service.  She speaks in a monotoned voice as if she hates answering the phone.  If you have any further questions other than scheduling, she will cut the conversation short.  I find this extremely rude especially for someone who runs a business.\n\nIf I were you, I would recommend to take ANOTHER POLE FITNESS STUDIO CLASS with Fawnia at www.polefitnessstudio.com.  She is the real deal, and obviously, more professional."
15421,1,"This is a difficult review to write.  I had the $39.99 prix fixe tasting menu about which the Mirage has been sending me emails for a few months.  \n\nAll the food I had was excellent.  I had lobster tacos, the prime skirt steak, and the jelly donut munchkin holes for dessert.  These get high marks in my review.  The tacos were luscious--the guacamole served with them was excellent!  The skirt steak was served with two sauces that were also very well done.  The munchkin jelly donut holes were really tasty with or without the vanilla sauce that came with them.\n\nNow for the minuses.  I had no bread service.  Evidently, if you order from the prix fixe menu, there is no bread service.  I didn't notice this until I was almost finished with my steak, so I didn't bother to ask then.  The steak came with two thin waffle potato chips.  That's it--no side of any kind, not a carrot slice, one broccoli floret, nothing!  I found it amazing when the server suggested I might want to order a side so I had enough to eat.  I did order a side of mashed potatoes at $8.  That sort of negates the prix fixe of early dining.\n\nWhen I first arrived the waitress brought me a \""new\"" prix fixe menu at $59.99 that I should consider as it would entail more food.  This is not on the Mirage website.  I did notice there was more food served including sides.  It seems to be a bait and switch scheme, but maybe no.\n\nI considered giving Stack a 2 rating but the food was all so good, I just couldn't.  I do know I won't be returning here.\n\nEdit:  You know, I have to give it a 2 star rating.  This just doesn't deserve 3 stars.  One star deleted."

He told me he was sending me a coupon or voucher, to make up for the bad experience and bad food, but 3 WEEKS LATER HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING.  City Hall again, has dropped the ball."
46677,0,"Nasty.   Bad food.  Rude,  indifferent staff.  1 star is being generous."
26621,0,"I have to give this restaurant 1 star because of a single employee's lack of interest in doing her job. A friend and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to see if they were open for lunch. We saw a young woman working at the podium and asked if they were open. She was on the phone, looked at us, and held up 5 fingers. Not being sure if that meant to wait just a minute, we stood there and waited. After maybe 3 minutes, she showed no intention of helping us or even getting off the phone. She wouldn't even look at us as I made it clear that we were looking for the website to see if they were open. She was on the phone still, now laughing at the conversation. It sounded like a personal call. I asked once again \""so you guys aren't open?\"", and got completely ignored. So we left, not able to dine there since we weren't able to find out from them if or when they'd open. We could smell food cooking from outside, so we assumed they were open. After we left, we took our business to a nearby competing restaurant, and I had probably best steak I've ever had in my life there (Filetto Di Manzo Toscano at Brio Tuscan Grille). I recommend everyone try the steak there. The service is also far superior, as their employees aren't making personal phone calls and ignoring customers.  I would have liked to try Texas de Brazil, but honestly with such a bad first impression, it doesn't seem like it's worth it.\n\nThis happened on Tuesday, September 9th, around 12:35pm.  I would encourage management to look into who was working the podium at that time and have a talk with her about priorities."
14122,2,"This review is for the RESTAURANT portion of the Foundation Room.\n\nI came here several nights ago for dinner, and it was ok, nothing great. The food isn't bad, but compared to the price, it's not worth it. I guess if you want a quieter place to dine, and you're a member, then sure, it's ok.\n\nI ordered the horseradish crusted, rib-eye steak. Again, it was good, but not great. I would have much rather have had a steak from Mesa Grill.\n\nFor sides we ordered the mashed potatoes, and something else, which I can't even remember, that's how insignificant it was.\n\nThe service and ambiance are great though. As everyone has pointed out, the view is spectacular. I'd come back for drinks at this particular Foundation Room, and skip the restaurant. Come to think of it, you can just go to Mix, at THE Hotel for drinks and an even better view.\n\nFood: 2\nAmbience: 5\nService: 5\nValue: 2"
46364,4,"An amazing find.  We were leaving lunch and just stumbled on this place...  I went RIGHT for the handbag section.  Chanel, Louie...  they have it all.  In great condition.  I ended up scoring the most amazing Tod's bag at a steal of a price and my friend got a dress that would have easily cost $500 at Barney's for like $70.  \n\nStaff is incredible and so friendly.  They also get subtle hints about how much you're willing to pay.  I was coveting a Chanel bag that was out of my price range but they noticed me spying another Chanel and subtly said, \""This one is reasonably priced\""...  in a way that didn't make me feel like a pauper.  \n\nIf you're near this place or traveling to Scottsdale, check out this store.  You won't regret it.  And you probably won't leave without one of their cute yellow shopping bags!"
39441,4,"We just saw the Mike Hammer show at the 4 Queens last night!  Wow!  He has amazing energy and creativity!  Mike keeps the show moving with fast paced comedy and magic.  \n\nHis impromptu style of pulling guests from the audience and enrolling them into the show was both captivating and a laugh a minute.  You just never know where you will be hammered with his keen since of humor and creative magic touches... I still can't figure out how he swallowed the raser blades and smiled while doing it.  The  Mike Hammer show is a must see, catch him now while he is affordable...It's my guess he will be on the strip in a big room sometime soon!  5 stars in our book!!!\n\nJesse Ferrell"
9451,3,"Golden Nugget???? What? That's what I thought when my friend said she just had the best time there. I was like \""Isn't that a dive hotel on Freemont?\"" hahahaha.\n\nSo, the Golden Nugget on Freemont has been recently renovated. No bad  old smokey casino smell anywhere to be found,  replaced by fancy decorations everywhere.\n\nWe got a room in the new tower for only $65 a night and the room was beautiful. Very modern and comparable to The Hotel at Mandalay bay but for a fraction of the price. It was beautiful.\n\nThe hotel is also filled with beautiful and fancy restaurants everywhere. Just walking around there made me hungry. They even have a cute chocolate boutique and other nice shops.\n\nThe pool is also amazing! They have a shark tank in the middle of the pool and you can even take a water slide THROUGH the shark tank....THROUGH. It was awesome.\n\n We rented a cabana up in the Hide Out at H2O ( adults only part of pool). It was $175 for a week day and $250 for the weekend. The cabana was the way to go and the adult only pool was absolutely what we were looking for. They provide you with 2 sun chairs are room for up to 6 people. They have a flat screen TV and gave us a meat/cheese/fruit tray as well as waters. Make sure to request for the larger cabana (up to 12) it is the same price but is given upon request.\n\nAll in all one of my favorite stay-cations in a while. If you are looking for a solid time check it out! You will not be dissapointed"
43695,2,"It's OK.\n\nThe good:\n- Nice location (glad to have something at Town & Country)\n- The parking was fine\n- The service was great\n- Prices are cheap\n- Chocolate milkshake was really good\n\nThe bad:\n- The Wreck\n- Sandwiches had hardly any meat and hardly any toppings\n- If you like a sandwich that is mostly bread then this is for you\n\nOn the cheap, I'd rather go to Subway.  Ho hum, at least at Subway I get my lettuce and tomatoes."
15452,2,"This is Las Vegas. So I have to tone down my perception of food quality in general.  And I've been to this restaurant 3 times in the past 24 months, at different time.\n\nIt served Dim Sum all day. But as expected, the dim sums after the rush hour, i.e. at night, was awful. During lunch hours when the foods were fresh, and abundant. The variety has been standard. Nothing too surprising. Lots of fried foods for American.\n\nThe price, as in all Las Vegas, was higher for what it's worth. For 2 people the last time we ate there, it's $30 for 10 items. Egg tarts are medium price (all places I've been to charged low price). The chow mien was a bit bland. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was very tender on the stalk.\n\nSo diners, it's good to have dim sum here during busy hour. For tourists, it's Las Vegas. Get used to it."
7107,1,Food as always is good.  The Service on the other hand is very unaccomdating.  The girl at the register let us know when we asked if there was a manager available that they were all on vacation.  So I am guessing that customer service is the last thing this place realy cares about.  Because of the rudness.
29709,1,"I joined a group of friends last night for dinner at Gallo Blanco, this being the first time for a few of us. When we first arrived, we were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait for a table of 6. We were totally fine getting a drink from the bar and chillin by the pool. However, after 1.5 hours of waiting we began to get a little impatient and when checking on our table status, the hostess informed us that there were only 2 tables in the restaurant that could seat 6 people and they were just waiting on a party to leave.\nAs we waited for another 30 minutes and were debating on going somewhere else, the hostess came over and told us there was a table open and it would be just a few minutes. It took about another 15 minutes to get seated as they had figured out they could combine a table of 4 with a table of 2.\nWe quickly ordered our food and I had ordered 1 shrimp taco and a side of guacamole and chips. After our table had received our order, I had still not gotten my side of guac and chips. When I asked about it, the server asked me if I was sure I had ordered it because they had delivered guac and chips to the table once - which my friends had ordered. Several more minutes go by and our waitress came to check in and I asked about my guac and chips again. After a lengthy conversation of clarifying what I had ordered, a side of guacamole was delivered to me, without chips. It took another few minutes to get the chips to go with my guacamole.\nThe service was extremely frustrating which definitely spoiled my experience. However, I have nothing bad to say about the food - it was excellent."
28090,2,"I would definitely recommend the rib eye and the bar tenders really know to pour solid cocktails. Price wise the menu is fairly steep, service was great though."
24468,1,"Pretty bad experience.  For starters, they eliminated my favorite starter: the Nachos.  Claim Jumpers had the best Nachos around and now...they dont.\n\nOur experience didn't get any better.  We waited nearly 15 minutes just to get two cokes.  We waited another 15 minutes before the server (bartender) decided to come out from behind the bar and actually take our orders.  He was too busy having a good time, apparently telling jokes with his bus boy buddies.\n\nThe pizza I ordered was awful....much worse than somethiing that wouldl show up at my front door from a Pizza Hut order.  The rest of the food was good so Claim Jumpers gets two stars instead of 1 but it's safe to say I will never be going back to Claim Jumpers again."
20327,1,"I can really appreciate some good Mediterranean food. Mediocre Mediterranean? Not so much... As far as it is from my house, I doubt I'll make the drive all the way out here any time soon.\n\nKABOBS: Doesn't Mediterranean food revolve around grilled meats? The steak souvlaki was a little tough, quite flavorless, and dry. Given I did take my order to-go, but the 15 minute drive home exasperated an already existing issue. The gyro meat was pretty tasty! It was thinly sliced and quite flavorful unlike the beef chunks they threw on a stick.\n\nSIDES: The combo plates we ordered were supposed to come with greek salad, rice, and pita. The pita was stone cold and they were out of rice--they replaced it with extra salad. We also got an order of the garlic fries. Basically, french fries packed with feta and some garlic powder. I've eaten better at the greek festival. \n\nThe kabobs and the rest of the sides were somewhat lack-luster. But we really enjoyed the calamari. It was just as delicious as the stuff I get at Firefly. But the dipping sauce it came with was disgusting . It was some stale tasting butter concoction.\n\nAfter this meal of good and bad, I'm kind've over Mediterranean food at this point. After finishing the whole meal, I couldn't substantiate that the $25 I spent plus gas was worth it."
7696,1,"Oh Red, White and Brew your customer service  needs so much work.  We had a group of 10, person #1 arrived at  4:40 and was given a pager and told we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived. At 5:15 8 people had arrived and you still wouldn't seat us.  After a discussion with the manager, he agreed to finally seat us but only a table for 8!  Within minutes, the other 2 people arrived with no where to sit.  Long story short, after an hour and 20 minutes we finally got an extra table (after being told they were too busy to give us that extra  table).  Food was good...but customer service is just as important. I won't be back!"
27620,0,Ate here yesterday. Didn't enjoy much about the dinner except that the chicken in the chicken and waffles was well cooked. Avoid this one.
2561,4,Best Subs around period.
43159,2,"Pretty average experience. Great view until you walk closer to the wall and you see nothing but abandoned buildings until you see South Mountain. It was cool being next to US Airways Arena and Chase field. For some reason I thought this bar was on the top of the hotel, but it's only on the third floor. Decent spot, drinks were okay, I might come back again if people from out of town are here."
1903,4,The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!
37082,1,"So admittedly I came here with a huge group (20 people) but we weren't looking to sit at a normal table and were fine with sitting in their outdoor patio/lounge area. Still our waiter looked like he was being thrown in to some sort of top chef challenge and literally muttered things like \""jesus christ, there's more?\"" and \""I'll bet they'll all want separate checks\"" well within earshot of all of us. Filter maybe?\n\nAnyways he took like 2/3 of our orders then disappeared for about 20 minutes (pen ran out of ink? the paper notepad was impossible to flip?!) and then when he did come back to serve food he tripped and spilled it on us. Eventually the other, decidedly more professional staff came to help out and things went relatively smoothly but if it's this guy's first day, or he has never waited a table before a place with Zink prices should probably discriminate in it's hiring a little more.\n\nAnyways, my tacos were eh and I thought the mac and cheese was kind of weak. Not bad food but after our fun time with the waiter I guess I just wasn't in the mood to enjoy my meal.\n\nAnd since he brought it up, we did all get separate checks."
47985,4,I probably visit 100 different Starbucks per year in my travels.  This is 1 of my favorites.  The store font is perfect and captures the beauty of the Phoenix Sunrise which makes the mood that much more perfect at a coffee shop in the AM.  The staff is very friendly and upbeat as should be the case for a morning coffee shop.  The patio is huge with lots of outdoor seating and the inside is really cool how they have a long leather bench that runs the length of the store and lots of 2 tops all the way down it.  Lots of seating and comfortable.
43484,0,"That place is horrible. We never get served and we got ignored from servers and bartender. They did not bring the  menus and didn't even ask us for drinks  for about 10 mins. So we just walked out. Again, that's terrible place to go."
10930,3,"Came here for the first time with a co worker at lunch! I will totally be back!  The all you can eat lunch special is well worth it!  The firecracker roll is a MUST! SO good!  It is a rather small place, and the seating does tend to feel a little on top of each other, but the service was fast and the food made up for it!  It did seem to draw a large lunch crowd, to get there somewhat early!"
23759,1,"Brio is located in Town Square in South Las Vegas. From the start, it looks really nice. The decor and the atmosphere totally exudes class and is warm and inviting. The outdoor seating with the fireplaces for the colder nights, and the misting sprays during the hot days are a great amenity to have. The food, however, left much to be desired. \n\nI went here to meet up with friends and have a nice relaxing dinner. The first course started very well. I ordered their lobster bisque and it was tasty and creamy and just plain delicious. Their bread is very good as well. I was looking over the main courses while waiting for my other friends and found the prices quite on the steep end. Perhaps it was the atmosphere that made them think they could charge exorbitant prices for pasta.\n\nAfter looking at the menu for a couple minutes, I finally decided on the lobster/shrimp pasta. It sounded so good and sounded like it would hit the spot. At approximately $24 it was pretty expensive but I figure it was worth a shot. The pasta was pretty disgusting when it came out. The pasta texture was off and undercooked, their sauce was tasteless and their shrimp were tiny in comparison to other italian eateries that charged that kinda price. Lobster? Yeah right, it was more like 2 measly scraps of lobster, that was overdone, ironically, since the pasta was underdone. \n\nI was not impressed at all. I think I had better pasta at Yardhouse and would have much rather go there than eat here again. Truly a waste of time and money. There are so many better places out there...dare I say that Olive Garden might be better? At least they cook their pasta right. \n\nIt was great seeing friends but the food was just horrendous. I would have gladly have gone elsewhere. The service was pretty good and my water was refilled frequently so I am happy to say their service isn't that bad. \n\nI can't get over how terrible their food was. I don't know what everyone else is raving about their food for. Yeckk.. truly a disappointing dining experience."
46702,2,"Visited this morning on a whim, after hearing mixed reviews.  However, after eating here, i believe those reviews to be slightly in error.  Granted, the decor is quite bland and could use a definitely remodel.  The food however, was pretty good.  Three out of the four of us got breakfast omelets, and everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  Omelets were big and fluffy, with plenty of ingredients.  Sides were good, and the bacon was super thick and tasty.  Additionally, our waiter was quite friendly, attentive, and professional.\n\nI was pretty surprised to see a Chicago Style Italian Beef on the menu, and as a self declared italian beef connoisseur, had to give it a shot.  Was actually pretty decent, albeit a little skimpy on the meat.\n\nI probably wouldn't go out of my way for this place, but would eat here again if in the area and looking for good food at a good price."
23772,2,"Food was ok, Great place for hang  out or for watching sports great selection beers"
2549,0,"Terrible customer service, they close 10 mins early as customers are getting out and turn them away, spend your money anywhere else."
3125,2,"My never-ending quest for amazing breakfasts led me to Liberty Market yesterday. This place is cool and shiny in a stainless steel, bedazzled, old farmhouse sort of way. The atmosphere is definitely the main thing the place has going for it-- always packed, always lively, new and hip. I also give it props for using obviously fresh, local produce and meat. \n\nThat being said, the breakfast didn't blow me away. I got a traditional combo of scrambled eggs, turkey sausage and a blueberry pancake. My date ordered the veggie scramble with a buttermilk biscuit and homefries. The pancake was delish-- super light and fluffy but the eggs and sausage were kind of lacking in flavor. Same went for my date's, though he said the biscuit was the best he's ever had and I'd have to agree. All this, plus their yummy display of desserts by the order counter, leads me to believe that Liberty Market knows how to bake but needs to add a bit of spice to its cooking. If I ever find myself in the boonies again, I would hit this place up (if only because there's not a whole lot of other options.)"
28525,1,When I got the bill it was a lot more than I respected because they charged me $3 for a 1/4th of a cup of sub-par gravy. She never told me it would be extra and it is just over priced in general. Also the country fried steak was some very poor quality meat. Only good thing about this place was their home fries and decorations. Never going back.
49262,3,"Food was pretty good, the lamb is pretty amazing. Tender, flavorful, and lacking in the strong gamy smell that it normally comes with. Swordfish steak was abit bland and tough and I would pass on it. Expensive but no more expensive than other restaurants in its class"
32983,4,"I have to say that I was very impressed with Garcia's Windows & More!  After my lawnmower sent a rock through one side of our four foot sliding-glass patio doorpanic set in.  I called several companies for quick replacement to no avail.  I read the reviews for Garcia's and noticed many reviewers stated he provided quick and friendly service, I had to give them a call.\n\nMark answered his phone at 7:45AM said the magic words that he had the glass in stock and could be at our house by 3:00PM on a busy Saturday no less, I didn't hesitate to complete the sale.\n\nAs promised Mark and his helper arrived right on schedule and went to work right away.  They meticulously removed the broken pieces of glass, carefully vacuumed the pieces up, and had the door re-installed in no time!\n\nThe service was friendly, quick, and the price was very fair.  Thank you doesn't say enough.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
24345,3,Great food again an great service. Love the thai tea..has become a fav place..
30118,1,let me get straight to the point: don't come here!\n\ni paid $38.00 for a mediocre meal...and that was just the lunch price!\n\nit's a typical buffet with a variety of food but the food wasn't amazing at all. the only items i really enjoyed was the prime rib and dessert bar....\n\nrefund please :(
499,3,"I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by, that's exactly what it looks like: a little shack in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. It make look a little sketch (there was some homemade BBQ for sale next to the Shack when I was here a few weekends ago), but they get the job done.\n\nI went here after a referral from a friend. I was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings. Sure enough, they had the key here. I had a new key and exchanged cash in about 5 minutes. If you have a hard to find key to duplicate - this is your spot!  Plus... one you're done you can stroll through the rest of Park Road Shopping Center if you so desire (cupcakes, coffee, Michael's, antiques, it's all here)."
12003,4,"We tried to get a table one night -- Wednesday, thinking this would be a slow night -- but couldn't get one until 7:30, which is just too late for us.  The hostesses were very nice about it but could not yield to our disappointment no matter how sad and pathetic a face I was wearing.  She gave us a card wtih their phone number and a sugggestion to call in the morning for a reservation.  We didn't because we weren't sure we'd be available.  Several days later we stopped in for lunch and were prompltly seated in what we thought was a \""good\"" table.  YAY!\n\nThe waiter was tall, good-looking, impeccably professional, and friendly.  I've heard some people express concern about bringing kids to MESA... and we brought two of them.  He really knew how to take care of us and how to effectively take care of our kids.  (I think he mentioned having 6 of his own, incluing a couple the same ages as ours.)\n\nLunch was fantastic and commensurate with the price.  We had a Bobby Flay Burger, Ancho-crusted scallop salad, Cornmeal crusted chile relleno, and the youngest child had the Crimini mushroom quesedilla.  As an appetizer we shared a Goat cheese queso fundido.  All was great and well within the palate of even our 8 year old.\n\nAll of our plates were picked up by the bus boy empty... practically licked clean.\n\nHaving never had Flay food before, I had a ntoion of what it might be like only from watching Chef Flay on the innumberable TV shows he is on.  His food lived up to that expectation:  fresh, high-quality, punchy flavors, cooked perfectly, and plating that was both clean and pretty.  Like most tourists we photographed our food... no matter how goofy that may have looked.\n\nOne of the best parts of the experience was the way we were allowed to enjoy the experience without a hint of either slowness or rushing.  If we needed anything there was someone immediately available to help.  When we were eating and talking, we were left alone to have our privacy.\n\nAll-in-all, this was definitely one of those \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"" experiences.  We're glad we did it and we'll certainly do it again!"
28371,3,"Thanks to Yelp we found this great little breakfast place while visiting Las Vegas. It's away from the strip, located in the middle of an industrial plaza. \nWe went on a weekday and waited about 15 min to be seated. We were greeted warmly and offered coffee while we waited. The coffee was excellent. When I asked the waitress about it, she said that they grind the beans in house. The food was also very good and the service was outstanding. \nThe ambience wasn't my favorite -think strip mall diner-noisy and crowded. The friendly owner was walking around greeting everyone and told us that they're planning to move to a nearby larger location early next year. \nWe like to support local businesses and will look for Mr. Mamas new location the next time we're in Las Vegas."
8448,0,"The service was so poor, I was about ready to call for delivery from Jack in the Box. Waiter offered lame excuses for his and the kitchen's slow service, citing that he had to wait the tables outside.  There was one couple outside!.  The place wasn't busy.  No excuse.  When the food arrived it was adequate.  Avoid this location if you have things you need to get done during the day, as you will be there awhile. Great menu, but you need to go to another location that believes in customer service."
37577,4,"While my car was being serviced I decided to pop in to Dori's to check it out. I ordered a blueberry muffin and it was awesome! The guy at the counter was super friendly and offered to warm it up for me. Fast forward a few hours later and my car was STILL being serviced so I called my husband to pick me up. It was around lunch time and we were going to get sandwiches from Subway but decided to walk down to Dori's to try them out. BEST DECISION EVER! The bread was so tasty and the ingredients were fresh (I had a turkey avocado and hubby had the chicken bleu cheese). The French bread was most definitely the best I have ever had; a little crusty on the on the outside but freaking soft in the middle! We both ordered the potato salad which is homemade and not the stuff that comes from the tub. It was so good that we will definitely be back! Oh, I forgot the red velvet cupcake. The frosting was very creamy and the cake was moist and delicious. For 99 cents you cannot go wrong :)"
43906,2,"Don't be mistaken TQLA doesn't have Mexican food exactly. It is called \""New Mexican\"" food. While it was pretty delicious I wasn't expecting this. The main difference is that there are a lot healthier choices than a Mexican food restaurant. The chips and salsa were good. The service was excellent. If you are coming here for traditional Mexican food you will be disappointed."
44626,0,"I guess since they have the cheapest cash price for gas here in Las Vegas, you don't need to have a nice personality. The guys here are just plain dicks, one of them smelled of alcohol too."
45856,4,"This is exactly what Vegas started out as.  It's what it's supposed to be about. A great live jazz band, beautiful women that are great dancers and a wonderful singer. I would recommend this show to anyone looking for something to see in Vegas."
34825,0,"I was expecting me to be an outcast by really not liking this club, but it looks like I am not alone. I have been to City a fair few times and have never had a good night here. However, the place is always really rammed to the brim making it uncomfortably snug when you get in. \nTheir Friday nights are famed allegedly alleviating students from paying over the odds, but in fact do quite the opposite- the drink 'deals' are some of the worst I have seen and you can get cheaper entry elsewhere.\nWhen I did go for one of their 'deals' I purchased three bottles of Fosters for me and a couple of friends. They put the three bottles in front of me, but before I paid them, someone stole a bottle and ran off (a fair example of the client\u00e8le City Nightclub draws). The bar staff said that I had to pay for all three and called over a bouncer to make sure I did or I would be thrown out.\nDespite the club being pretty big, especially for Edinburgh, there isn't enough areas in the club to sit down and actually chat with you mates, which is probably deliberate as this makes you more likely to go for one of their drink 'deals'. Your other option is to go to the dance floor where you can barely move and are constantly pushed and shoved.\nNeedless to say, I am not in a hurry to return to City any time soon!"
39734,2,"I've had better but this one was good, better than I've found so far in Phoenix. But it was a bit pricey for me and inconvenient that they only accept cash."
31868,1,I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.
13635,2,"Interior lighting has been brightened, thus losing the cool-hip and dim feel that I craved so much from DELUX. Liquor menu is WAY OUT dated, staff made no effort to compensate. Prices have gone up. Service is consistently INCONSISTENT. There's a TON of places where you can get an $8 cocktail and $10 burger.."
15733,1,Went here once for your curiosity and once because I was dragged here. Fat burger is mediocre at best. Its overpriced and takes wayyyy too long to get your food. In N out kills this place and is almost have the price. I would rather go to burger king or carls jr and those places are shit.
43318,3,"As close as this location is to where I stay, I had never been to it before.  They weren't as fast to prepare as the one at Baseline and Country Club or the one by Chandler Mall.  I got the Italian and my daughter got the  turkey.  Both were fresh and delicious and a good size for the money, $5.95 each. They only cut the sandwich in half if you request it so my torpedo was whole.  They said it had an oil and vinegar dressing but it was so light as to be indiscernible.  If they had pepperocinis I wasn't aware of it.  The roll was wonderful.\n\n All was fine till I decided it needed a little oomph and went up to the counter to ask for pepper since there were no shakers on the tables.  What? No pepper??  I can't fathom that.  I didn't like the loud music either.\n\nWill I go back? Hell yeah.  But I'll take my own pepper."
26834,2,"I'm disappointed that this place isn't holding up to what it used to be. It's still pretty good but not like it was. The service has become pretty dismal. They have discontinued certain toppings, which I miss. And one thing they have started doing, which is kind of silly but annoying, is before they weigh your yogurt, they pick up a spoon and put it in your cup, to make sure you are paying for the weight of the spoon. Cheap."
22788,2,Great spot; food ok; staff does try but not the best...love the views and the room.....
43278,2,"Food is pretty good however it would be nice if they had some healthier options on the menu. The inside of the restaurant needs some major work. Location not great, would probably do better if it was not on Independence Blvd. \n\nOverall, if you are a vegetarian interested in HEALTH, this is not the best option as a lot of the options are deep fried and I would suggest getting takeout instead of eating in the restaurant as the atmosphere is not great."

22333,1,"Where do I begin? \n\nLet's start with the server who literally yelled everything he asked or said to us. Oh, and then he rammed a chair into my leg and was just not very concerned about our experience overall.\n\nLet's move on to the cheese crisp, which had plenty of grease cascading off the pieces, and virtually no \""crisp.\"" Did you put some cheese on a tortilla and microwave it? 'Cause I could have done that at home.\n\nBoth drinks were quite tasty- my tea was strong like I like it, but not bitter. Hubby's lemonade was very good, but he drank it so fast I didn't get a chance to steal many sips.\n\nLet's discuss the entrees, shall we? Hubby's carne adovada chimi was decent, better than my carnitas. In fact, MY carnitas is better. (I keep aiming for Chef Hector's at Sam's...) Yes, the pork was very tender, but the salt was -shall I put it nicely?- aggressive. Sam Kinneson aggressive. The \""tortilla\"" was an inedible science experiment. Thick and doughy, and made even more appetizing by the charred side, it reminded me of the salt play dough we all made as kids, formed into a pancake. Truly nasty.\n\nAs for the legendary salsas, Hubby found the green to be tasty, but he did not care for the flavor of the red. Neither was especially fiery to him either. \n\nRiding on reputation, are we?"
6348,1,"I stopped here out of annoyance of having to wait at another salon & wanting to get the ordeal over with. I wanted a trim, I didn't need a trim. \nI walked in and was told 10 minutes, I was okay with that considering the place before offered a 45 min wait. \nI was promptly greeted and seated after the 10 min wait. I explained I need a trim because I was getting my hair done in twists the next day. The stylist offered to do a protein treatment and I agreed because I understood its benefits. Prior to beginning the treatment I stated I wanted to retain length versus being even!!\nWe proceeded with the conditioning process and everything was okay until the trimming process started.  Somewhere in my spirit it felt wrong as I watched the ends fall to my shirt. I made a comment about it being too much and she assured me it was just 2 ringlets nothing more. Once she got to the front my heart begin to panic as I realized that her method for cutting was so wrong...at that point it was too late. \nI paid and I left, due to me having a delayed response with things I didn't truly see that her trim equaled more than 1 & 1/2 inches of my hair being cut off due to her IMAGINARY split ends until later!!! I'm beyond distraught as I went from 3 inches to almost bra strap length in less than 3 years with no trim, to be knocked back a bit. I went in hoping to increase my efforts in achieving a solid bra strap length before the year was over. Her CUT vs TRIM set me back to the length of my hair in the winter time. -sigh- ughhh I hate it!!\nThey got 2 stars for being nice and readily available but I despise this trim, regret it. Enough to make me finally sit down and write a review. I've done a lot that needed a Yelp response but playing with my hair just set me off completely!"
3080,3,"Wanted to try something new so when I saw a Groupon at two for the price of one, I was thrilled.  I almost lost the promotional value though cause I waited till the last minute to book our reservation.  (Make sure you look at Groupon expiration dates). Anywho,  I took the opportunity to turn it into a date night with my hubby.  They had weekend dates available which fit our schedule perfectly. The place was easy to find and was located right off Chandler blvd. We had a group of twelve for our time slot and was considered a large group but everyone was cooperative which made the instructors job easier.  I was a bit nervous but after a few simple instructions, I was aiming and shooting at the target with no problem.  The instructor, Julie made it fun and competitive by adding balloons and zombies as target practice.  It was awesome! I'm proud to say I beat my hubby and had more head shots then he did.  It was an exciting way to spend an hour trying something new! Try it and see!!"
18265,4,"Thank you Darren for bringing me here for our anniversary (3 years!). I wanted a romantic, intimate dinner, and the staff pulled out all the stops, even putting us in a posh booth in the back of the dining room and giving us a free shareable dessert with a candle in it. \n\nA serving of the Pan Seared Scallops was our starter, and they were delicious, especially with the bacon marmalade. My entree was the Maple Leaf Farm's Duck Breast which was tender beyond compare. It was complimented by a blueberry port reduction, parmesan risotto, and green beans, all of which was fantastic. \n\nOur dessert that we shared was the scrumptious Banana Foster Napoleon. \n\nOur server Cheryl was really nice as was the decor. \n\nBistro 19 rocks."
14293,1,"OK, so perhaps my overall Wynn experience led to me giving Okada 2 stars instead of 3....but it really deserves NO MORE.\nThe posse and I made reservations 2 weeks i advance, (mostly because I'm a spaz planner like that), and upon arrival, the hostess tells us there will be a twenty minute wait....OK\nFinally we are seated, order our sake, appetizers, and then our waiter leaves...I guess he didn't want to take our dinner orders? OK, slow food dining experience...our sake comes, service is extremely attentive, constantly filling our sake cups, pouring water, etc...our appetizers come, and everyone VANISHES! No joke, we waited after our appetizer plates were clearly licked clean for a busser, a server,ANYONE to come back and take our entree orders. One of our party ends up getting up, and physically grabbing a buss boy, asked him to send over our waiter....another 20 min go by...FINALLY, he appears. No apology, takes our entree orders, and vanishes...no, \""would you like another bottle of sake,\"" NOTHING. Being rather annoyed at this point, and our whole table talking about the bad service, our entrees come, still no refill on the sake....we ask for our server, he NEVER comes back to our table. We finish our entrees, decide dessert at this place is not worth another hour wait, and flag down another busser, CHECK PLEASE!. We wait, and wait and wait....no check. WE decide this is too comical a situation to be pissed, so we get up, all eight of us, leave our table and walk directly to the hostess, demand to see a manager. Manager comes after another 15min wait, we explain the situation, he chastises us for \""walking out on the bill,\"" we hand him a pile of cash and swear never to return. \nI'd like to clarify, we didn't try and walk out on the bill, we would have just walked straight out the front door had that been the case. We were trying to pay for our meal so we could go downstairs and enjoy our table a Tryst. Not only did the manager not apologize for our terrible service, he didn't offer to comp anything, and had a nasty attitude the whole time. \nI will never go back to Okada, the food was decent, but when there are places like Social House, why would I endure bad service when I'm paying top dollar?"
12748,2,"August trip: Arrived here by taxi (cheaper than using a shuttle!) from the airport. The Bell-Man took our luggage so we did not need to wait in line for the luggage area. Check-in took about 30-45 minutes on a Sunday. We stayed in the newly renovated Grand Tower. Amenities included king bed, expensive mini fridge, awesome upgraded view for our anniversary. The spa was terrific except for the nude woman inside the women's hot tub. Germs - EW! Beware of the pool. I came back with an unwanted bacterial infection on my legs that took 4 weeks to clear up with antibiotics."
14748,3,"Great service! It was our last night of the trip and after the La Reve show, we needed something to eat and heard from a local that she like Bento box here and thought we would give it a try! We were in a sushi kick! We wanted something light as it was later than usual dinner time for us. We ordered the best of the best udon in the whole world--CLAM UDON! Let me tell you, I was in heaven! The broth was creamy and bisque-like and Clams were not from the can! The broth was on a salty side, but I love the saltiness of it! I cleaned the bowl! Sushi were great, we ordered Toro, Sake, Hamachi and the Citrus miso Hamachi was good, but not outstanding, I like the pure form of fish better."

34794,3,"I love tapas, and i was excited to finally try Johnny Smalls. The restaurant was packed but not too noisy, we were able to talk comfortably.\nThe best deal is to sign up for a players card or if you already have one, even better. Tell your waitress if you order the AYCE deal and you'll get $5 off for you and your companion.\nWhat we tried...my favorite was the Small Balls (YUM!!!),   Caprese salad was small but full of flavor,   Crab and Artichoke Dip was cheesy and delicious,   Grilled PB&J with apricot jam was sweet and tasty,    Mighty Balls were good, traditional meatballs,     Asada Tacos were good but nothing special,     Cow Pie Sliders were good, lots of taste,     So Beefy Sliders were good, but needed more meat on them,       The Lobster Pillow Puffs we hated, so we sent them back, they tasted doughy, the sauce had no flavor,      The Finger chicken on a stick was good, dip they serve along side is delish,    Tuna tartare quesadillas were good, but it was a big portion, so be sure you have someone to share it with,      Meat Lover flat bread was okay, the guys liked it, I didn't like the sauce on it, it was peppery and smokey.\nEven though the desserts sounded yummy we were stuffed and had to pass. Service was good throughout. I can't wait to go back."
31455,1,"Maybe I am becoming less tolerant as I grow  older. That combined with the fact these Walmart employees probably don't receive a whole lot of training, made for a frustrating shopping experience. I've seen ping pong tables on display at other locations and wanted to purchase one for the house full of people we are expecting over the holidays. I asked the employee in sporting goods if they had any on display. He says they are in the garden section. I play along and go to the garden section. Julie tells us they are displayed up front and only stored in garden. We find the display, the Mrs approves, we purchase one and confirm with the cashier that we pick it up in the garden section. Upon going back to the garden section and telling Julie I need to pick up my PP table, she tells me \""that's in sporting goods.\"" She then proceeds to ask me who told me the table was to be picked up in the garden section. This is the same Julie that told me just minutes earlier the tables were stored in the garden section. Julie has me wait at the garden area while she goes to sporting goods to find someone to grab me a table. She came back alone only to get someone in the garden section to get one from, guess where?, the garden section. It was like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing and Julie seemed like a fish out of water. The only thing that bumped this to a two star experience was Assistant Manager Bill and the two employees that loaded the beast into my vehicle. This is two subpar experiences lately. Maybe it's time for me to find a new Walmart mothership."
19779,3,"This review is only for the Chippery, not the daiquiris. (Though I bet they are delicious!) \n\nI was wandering around the Forum Shops and I wanted just a little snack before heading home. My friends were getting daiquiris and I saw they have food in the back so I shoved my way through all those wanting frozen drinks and went back. I was pleasantly surprised at the chip selection. They had 6-8 flavored of homemade chips for really reasonable prices, $3 or $5 per bag depending on size. \n\nThe only reason that it gets less than 5 stars is that the service wasn't great. Not cheery people this afternoon at Caesars! It is definitely a hidden gem for a cheap little snack."
6771,2,"I've been here for brunch before and it was amazing! However, I was disappointed by a recent trip for a friend's bday. \n\nWe had a big group and hung out in the bar area, standing/mingling, and occupied the three tall, center tables. It was a Monday night and the service was EXTREMELY slow. It looked like the server, in addition to the bar area, was also responsible for some tables in the dining room.\n\nI ordered a drink and it arrived about 20 minutes later. A friend ordered food at the same time and his food arrived about 10 minutes before my drink. And we were sitting right next to the bar! The drink did not fit the description on the menu (it sounded like a martini, based on the description, but ended up being some sweet concoction served in a wine glass) and I sent it back (something I very rarely do). I asked for a different drink and it arrived, another 15 minutes later.\n\nThe dinner small plate and entree options leave much to be desired. With a large group, we wanted to order a few shareable plates, but all the small plates on the menu did not seem very sharing-friendly. Also, why does EVERYTHING have bacon?? The entrees seemed very over priced (tilapia for $22, are you kidding me?). \n\nI would definitely return for brunch, but never for dinner or drinks."
27859,3,"Food is made fresh... its good, quick and easy!  Only drawback is that you are essentially eating on the casino floor  ...but got to watch a hockey game while I ate."
14021,3,"My fav lounge in Las Vegas! My group of friends wanted a chill place and it was around 1am. The guy said we can go to the promotor Booth and we got in for free. There was no line and the staff were nice! Drinks ranged around 9$-12$ and were decent. I loved that the place was not super crowded, had pretty good music (hip hop, top 40) and it was not super loud. You could actually talk to someone. I loved that there is an inside and outside. The view was so pretty! I would come back!"
6943,0,"I take my Yelp reviews very seriously.  To me, giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious, that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result.  Oh wait...that's exactly what happened.  I recently flew into Phoenix with my brother, his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding.  We rented an SUV with a car seat.  Initially, my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them, as they were unfamililar with this model, and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat.  Fine.  No big deal.  We install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to Sedona the next day.  \n\nMy brother's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just wouldn't go away.  Finally, he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that Hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact, unsafe to hold a child.  A quick call to Hertz later and I KID YOU NOT, we were informed that it was not negligence on their part, it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided.  Are you counting?  We have two strikes so far.  Massive error that could have led to death of child (that's gotta count for at least 10 strikes though...right) and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem.  The bro in law located a nearby Hertz location, and they said we could come and pick up a new seat.  They gave us a new seat, they sure did.  Once again, I kid you not, this one was missing clips.  \n\nWe made our way back to the original Hertz location at the airport.  The staff were rude, and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we'd never seen before.  I understand they can't actually install it for liability purposes, but I can't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car.  Regardless, we never once received an apology, just continued rude behavior and eye rolls.  I travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency.  You can be sure that Hertz will never receive mine, my family's or any of my friends' business again.  You can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who I run into on the street.  This is how infuriated I am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation."
43297,4,"Love this place. Much less of a wait time than the doctor's office and much more inexpensive than the hospital. I wouldn't suggest walking in though. There may be a wait. They have a WAHOO option (Wait At Home Or Office). You call in, tell them why you need to get in and they call you back when there's a room available. This way you can wait in the comfort of your own home. Also a good way of preventing germs in the waiting room."
1743,4,"This is a great spot for a date, and the price is right!  Unique dishes and atmosphere.  Great specials and free desert.  I also can't say enough about the service.  Our server gave great recommendations and brought out 3 different deserts at the end of the meal.  To be honest, I had to think twice about posting a review of this place for fear that it's going to become too popular.  But I would give them 6 stars if I could."
15348,2,"This is a nice place, much better than any other of the breakfast joints in the hotel...\n\nI ordered an OJ, hot chocolate and the pain perdu (French toast); which came with sausage and 4 tiny pieces of fruit. The meal was good but wayyyy too small. I ended up starving after. Oh well...\n\nThe waitress was very friendly and the setting is good. The chairs were very uncomfortable, ergonomics wise..."
36548,1,"Argh. Groan. Kind of a waste of money. My feelings about the ice bare are all over the place honestly. I'm going to with 2 stars, because even though I thought it was \""okay\"" it still isn't that entertaining.\n\nBut... It's an experience I can tick off my list at least! I went with a group of four and we all purchased the $15 general admission - jacket and gloves. When we got in it was empty! There were only a few people in there. Mind you, this was a Friday night on Halloween weekend! So we got free shots (poor, watered down) and took some pictures. \n\nYou have to deposit your cameras and cell phones into a locker outside before you go in. That's so they can rape you with the prices of purchasing the pictures THEY take of you. As if it isn't already overpriced to be paying $15 to go freeze and look at ice.\n\nI mean, it's a cool thing to do if you have the money to throw around, but if you just want to get drunk and party - go elsewhere! Also, make sure you go with a big group, you'll have a better time."
3595,1,"High marks for the tasty pizza, but beware the build your own option!  We ordered a 14\"" thin crust with chicken, roasted red bell pepper, mushrooms, and feta, and the bill came out to $27.50!  I ordered from their online menu, which did not list the price of these ingredients. If I knew it would be that expensive, I would not have ordered it. I spoke with the manager who apologized for those prices not being listed on website, but stopped short of doing anything to make it right, apparently unconcerned about losing a 17 year customer. We like their pizza but there are other excellent, less pricy options we'll choose next time."
8686,3,"Very delicious food! We are not vegans or even vegetarians, but we just love this place! We have been trying to eat healthy lately, and this place was just perfect for that. The consistency of the mock chicken dishes was almost perfect, and we weren't left with that sick, full feeling in our stomachs. Wish this place was closer to where we live!"

His work is absolutely beautiful, a true artist so to speak. He clearly takes pride in his work and makes it look all too easy. His price was perfect and the product was even better. He applied nano-ceramic tint on all windows and I couldn't be happier. He made a customer for life out of me. Take him your car... You won't be disappointed!!"

5410,0,"This place used to have awesome food.  It was a great buffet.  Then the location changed and I am guessing the cooks did too.  The food was terrible.  Buffets in Las Vegas that are good are slammed with people even the mediocre ones have lines.  This place, was dead at 7 pm on a Wednesday.  We go out to eat on Wednesdays and we sometimes go to Buffets.  When we do go to Buffets they are slammed with people and have long lines.  This place you just walk right on up, pay you money and go grab a plate.  Problem is, is that buffets rely on turn over so the food doesn't just sit under the heat lamps and get old.  This place had nothing but food under the heat lamps that looked old.  They had Prime Rib but every last piece of it was cooked well done.  The whole place was terrible food.  To many good buffets in town with a comparable price to eat here."
19771,1,"Madhouse used to be awesome. My husband and I live right behind it and go to madhouse several times a week. The coffee is always awesome and the staff USED to be just as awesome. They have since hired a couple of staff members that have been very rude and honestly pretty trashy. Wish they'd hire the type of staff that used to work here. The last straw happened today when my husband and i were asked if we wanted to add a tip to the card. We weren't happy with the attitude of the worker and told her no. When looking at the receipt later we saw that she added a tip anyways. We are officially done. As much as I dislike Starbucks, at least they've got classy and honest workers. Bye madhouse, you've lost some very loyal customers"
15038,1,Not a lot of selection. The food sucks.
12658,2,"Ok so i waited a few days after my vacation to review this place so as to let everything settle in. \nFirst off, I wanted to say that i came here having high hopes as this hotel is a staple on the Vegas strip and it came highly recommended. \n\nCHECK IN:\nOne thing to note for anyone coming here for the first time, if you arrive before 10am they do not let you check in. Other places, such as the Palazzo where I stayed the year prior, let you check in regardless of time and call you or text you when your room is ready. Mirage does not let you do this until after 10am. I did not know this and was literally waved away by the front desk clerk. Neither did she explain this to me.  She didn't seem approachable enough for me to feel comfortable to go back to and ask ANY questions.I had to call the 800 number to ask this. She was pleasant and answered all my questions.\nThe bell hop at the from of the hotel was unfortunately very rude to me too. I must've forgot to say thank you because he angrily and sarcastically said \""you're welcome!\"" to me. I guess to point out the fact that i forgot to thank him. My bad for not thanking him but i was just waved away from the desk clerk and trying to figure out why. Im sure Im not the ONLY person who didn't thank him. Is he rude to EVERYONE?! I found myself apologizing to HIM! WTH! Keep in mind theses were my VERY first interactions with the staff. And based on their job positions, theses are the very first interactions most people have. I tried hard not to let this ruin my day. I kept on. \n\nHOTEL: \nOne thing you'll notice as soon as you walk in is an odd odor. Im not saying its bad as I'm sure a lot of people must like it. But its not for me, It took about the entire 3 days of my trip for me to get used to it. Its very intoxicating and really hard to take at first. Its like a punch to my face. You'll know what I'm talking about if you go visit other hotels during your stay. Theirs is a bit more subtle. A little smoky too. Other than that though, the premises are kept pretty clean. Crowd is probably a little younger than my liking. With youth usually comes a lot of rowdy behavior and late night hallway shenanigans. I was awoken a few times by this during my stay. Vegas, right?! I just didn't get awoken at other places Ive stayed at on the strip that were higher end. I guess its more normal than I thought. Gym is great (check out my review of the spa/salon)\nRooms are clean and modern. Housekeepers, sweet as pie. Always kept us fully stocked.\nMy clock radio in the room never worked. Never called to get this replaced or fixed as to not deal with anymore staff.\nBeds were a little too soft for my taste. I like soft but these were hard to sleep in. \n\nPOOL:\nPool is huge and fun. Very lush and beautiful waterfalls. I enjoyed my time here. You have to get here early to get seats, they fill up fast. They only have about 1 waitress servicing different sections. Greats are good. Mine looked horrendous but tasted great. CAUTION: tips IS added on. Is this legal? So unless you intend to double tip, don't fork over any extra cash if you don't have to.\n\nOVERALL:\nMy overall stay here was ok. If everything during your stay goes perfectly and you don't have to deal with the staff, then you should have a very pleasant trip. If you should have the unfortunate luck that something goes wrong and you have to ask for help. GOOD LUCK!\nI more than likely will not be coming back here. Would only recommend this place if you don't care about great customer service and are just looking for a place to stay. I work hard for my money and don't make much. When i finally am able to get away for a few days and decide to stay at your hotel with the many options there are, why would you want to be rude?!\nI do want to give a shout out to the bell hop on the way out. Wish I knew his name. He was super nice and helpful. Too bad i couldn't have met him on day one."
47949,0,"One star because my meal rocked. I had the Hawaiian sliders. \n\nThe wait was 30 min at 10:15 am. We waited 10 min at our table before we received water and coffee. We then had to ask 4 times for coffee refills which took about 10 minutes each time to get. That's another 40 min. I don't want to EVER have to ask. \""Our\"" waiter never actually refilled it. Mikey was too busy. Another female waitress overheard us complaining and she refilled it once. One of the meals that came out was cold. I mean cold... The cheese wasn't even trying to melt. It was not good. We sent it back with little apology from our \""waiter.\""  I had to ask for a coke refill. Again why am I having to do this? We then asked for butter for the pancakes. I swear to you 7 minutes passes and he comes back and says, \""oh I forgot the butter, do you still want it?\"" No. No. No. Screw this we are done. \nAs we paid and the young man asked if it was ok and we said no it was actually a bad experience for our first time there. He simply took our money and  never looked up. That's crap in my opinion. You just lost a potential customer for the duration of our vegas living. \nThe \""manager\"" looked just as lost as the rest if the staff while she was taking names to be seated and not back running the kitchen and doing quality assurance checks. What a crock. I chose not to say anything to her because I felt like that was a moot point as well. \nOn a side note there is only one restroom for the males and one for the females. We used the men's once because it stupid to stand in line that long for the women's. This place is huge and it's not equipped to handle the volume."
38563,1,"Slow service, weak food, im not sure the beers we ordered had any alcohol in them they tasted watered down.  The place looks promising but I was dissapointed."
19015,2,I have tried 3 or 4 dishes there and none impressed me. Their pad Thai is okay... One of those restaurants that I would eat at if I craved Thai and there was nothing else nearby.

6379,2,"I know I said that they were professional and all, but the other day we received a bill for what the insurance wouldn't pay.  It came in a decent envelope, but then we opened it.\n\nPlain sheet of paper with printing.  No tear-off portion, no return envelope (not to mention return postage - I wouldn't expect that from anyone).  Just a sheet, badly folded, printed out on a cheap printer.\n\nSo much for professional.  I guess that only extends to examinations - and presumably procedures.  Definitely not to the billing department.  We get a lot of medical bills since we started buying our own insurance, and this is definitely the cheapest of the bunch.\n\nI get that it's only a few cents for an envelope and all - but it can't cost them much more to have some reasonably pre-printed invoices with tear-off return portions, much less a return envelope.  It would just make for a nicer experience, you know?"

48911,3,"I visited this place when my boyfriend had to attend the SEMA exhibitor summit. After their second day, SEMA treated everyone to a mixer event here and a ride on the high roller afterwards. I had no idea it was open bar, so I behaved and only had a vodka sour, which was made really well. Believe me, some people make it just as a lemonade, or with a splash of yellow. The hostesses passed around finger foods that included fried lobster, crab cakes, beef in a blanket, chicken on a stick, and lady finger desserts. The food was great and the girls were friendly and not stuck up, which can really make or break the experience of wherever you are. The ambiance of the bar was an old timey, but modern and classy twist to it, definitely somewhere you'd want to spruce yourself up a bit when you're there. \nThere is one downside to it, I wish that it was just a little bit bigger, it feels pretty cramped, although there is an outside section, it still feels like your are up in everyone's bubble.\nI will most certainly be back to this place when I am in town again, the Linq is actually a really neat place to hang out after you get drinks at Blvd."
31484,0,"Style over substance is my summary of the salon.  The place is moderne and all the stylists have the latest and greatest salon jargon down.  The look of the place is hip for Vegas.  The staff is super courteous.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of talent.  I got a pretty bad haircut and style.  Think bad prom hair.  My boyfriend keeps calling me Snooki now.  If I wanted to look like a desperate housewife from New Jersey, I would just wander over to one of the salons that the old ladies visit here in Boulder City.  I wouldn't have had to schlep across town to be annoyed by helpful people who can't fix hair."
13104,1,"I usually stay in a Go or Go Deluxe room but was trying to save some money during Frozen Fury (October).  We decided to go with a normal Fab Deluxe room due to the savings it would lend us.  BIG MISTAKE.  We were in the Habitat Tower and were overlooking the Linq.  The noise from the Linq made it nearly impossible to sleep.  I called housekeeping to request ear plugs, but they don't carry them.... I could purchase them at their convenient store though.  The bathroom was also in desperate need of a remodel!  The beds and pillows were SO uncomfortable too! \n\nThe elevator up was nice enough, but once you got to the hallway you could tell it had not been updated in at least 15-20 years.  The carpet was rippled and you could literally trip on the bunched areas.  Our ice maker didn't work and it was just one huge pain in the butt.\n\nThis last stay was the worst ever in Vegas.  We ended up checking out at 4:00am just so we could get home to CA to get a good sleep.  I have never actually wanted to leave Vegas until this trip."

17454,2,"We had dinner take out from this restaurant. The person who took our orders was very friendly. It took 15 min for the order to be ready, which is reasonable. The food was pretty good. I had curry chicken with rice and my husband had the three meet dish, with beef, chicken, and shrimp. It was pretty good, too. \nI give this restaurant 3 stars, because I don't have anything to complain about and the food was good. Also, I haven't eaten inside the restaurant yet and will definitely write another review if I do.\n\nDec. 6th\n\nTime to update this review and to write about my second experience with Golden Phoenix: \n\nLast night, my husband and I were craving Chinese food again but didn't feel like driving too far. Since we had a good first experience with this restaurant, we thought we would give it another shot. \n\nI have to say, this was a quite entertaining experience. I honestly would give this restaurant 4 stars for the food. The quality of the food is very good and everything tastes super fresh BUT the service deserves a minus 6 starts. \n\nFirst of all our server knew little English. When we ordered our food, he would just stand there and stare at us. We repeated our order 3 times and still he brought us somebody else's food. He did not check on us once to ask if we needed anything else. My husband had to stand up a couple of times to go ask for hot sauce or to go ask for the check etc. \n\nAt the end we left this place with 6 to go boxes, because they kept messing up the orders and we also got some extra fried rice with shrimp that we hadn't ordered. \n\nLuckily I wasn't upset about it at all, because we ended up leaving the place with a lot of food and got also military discount on our original order. \n\nAbstract:  Food fantastic, service catastrophic!!"
13987,2,"While the restaurant itself was nice and the staff was also very nice the food was nothing that I can say was truly amazing. We were expecting a very 5 star experience when it came to the food and we were surprised when the food came out just a few minutes after we ordered. Most everyone in our party thought the food was average, nothing to right home about. We have a restaurant near us called Frida Mexican Restaurant in Glendale,CA and there food is much much better. On the bright side I did order the Nachos and this seem to be the hit on the table So much so that everyone started munching away at my food \n\nSo heres the deal for me, I am always looking for amazing Mexican Food, something above and beyond what I can expect living in Los Angeles. Diego was not it for me, Great looking place, Friendly Staff, with So-So Food."
38088,3,"Fun atmosphere, hidden hole-in-the-wall. Friendly employees. Pepperoni and meatball pizza was awesome."
26423,0,"Totally craptastic...me and my friend go here because its right around the corner from the house...there were 2 people in here, so its not like the server was n Tue weeds..\nI order all you can eat. Three rolls, only get 2, she takes my menu away and never returns it. Then when I ask for my menu back she has a total stank attitude and gives me the wrong one I filled out!!  I never got my third roll, I was too pissed off.  The edamame was covered in salt like McDonald's French fries...I had to rub it off with a napkin...It was a total waste. And free sake???  Doesn't exist. Fuckery. Total fuckery."
21984,2,"A good sandwich, but not the best I've tried.  We decided to split the roast beef and jerk chicken to get some variety.  I'm normally a beef guy, but I think the jerk chicken had more flavor.  \n\nThe sandwiches are small and I prefer more meat.  The bread to meat ratio was too far to the bread.  The bread is good, toasted and hot, but I want to be able to taste more meat in a sandwich."
10288,1,Meh.\nPork chop with eggs was dry. Bread had a very salty butter. Buddies steak was good. Don't care to go back.
25880,3,"Great location in the downtown area, great coffees, super nice staff. Did I say I thought it was great? Yes, I did. . ."
30186,2,"After reading all of the great reviews, I am really excited to go to this restaurant.  We made a reservation because, online it said that they were recommended, but there were not many people in the place. We got the suggested appetizer of the Tuna Susci and it was delicious! The waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and I could share.  It was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned. My boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it--it really wasn't that great.  It actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy, but he was a good sport and ate it all.  I order the duck breast, and the duck was cooked perfectly.  The only suggestion I have is that the duck was cut VERY thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze.  It was good, but not over the top amazing.  We were pretty full but ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert---OMG AMAZING!  It definitely made up for the mediocre dinner. The service was really great, the dinner was blah, and the dessert was really good.  I would recommend this place, BUT I would not come here again.  There are too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas, this definitely has the atmosphere but I do not think our dinner was worth 150$."
25094,2,"While I miss the Niche when Bobby & Jenn owned it, Adam & Stephanie continue to keep things fresh. A total makeover & new brands to be exact. The decor is something like 50's / 60's / americana / classic style.\n\nAdam, Stephanie & Myk  are really friendly & helpful.  \n\nNow don't  go in thinking you'll have a huge selection, as the shop is small. And the prices are pricey...but remember, these are high end brands.  If you're looking for some unique threads, look no further than Niche."
2990,0,Horrible and liars.  I asked them to not run my credit and wouldn't sign a info sheet. A few days later I checked my credit and their was a hard inquiry from them. We will spread the word about their dishonest practices and of course never buy from them.
24523,4,"Great atmosphere and outstanding service, the food just pairs with everything! Del Frisco's is in line with Morton's and Ruth's Chris. Can't really pinpoint if it is better or worse but I would stay it is at least the same. I still think that the Dressler's Restaurant has a better steak though.\n\nThere are a lot of people complaining about the price... seriously? If you would like a $9.99 steak go to Outback. This is a prime steakhouse, prime steakhouse has prime service and prime food, that costs money and in exchange has excellent quality. If you are paying $40 in a steak and it stinks it is a different story, but with Del Frisco's you will have a much better experience than any other prime steakhouse I have been to."
29862,4,"love it here! the pastries are always excellent and baked fresh at their other site. Its a pretty big place, there are always seats inside and out, which is really nice. The service was great and very friendly. They have really incredible whip on drinks- it has coffee flavor in it, so totally worth the extra calories :)"
16756,3,"The Spotted Donkey is a great restaurant at el Pedregal at The Boulders.  One of the most scenic patios in the Valley of the Sun with top notch cuisine.  Great margaritas and ice cold Negra Modelo (yum). We started with the shrimp ceviche that was cool and refreshing, filled with flavors of pineapple, red onion, jalapeno, shrimp and lime juice.  For dinner I had the Pork Tenderloin served over green chile mac-n-cheese.  It was wonderful and bountiful serving so I was able to bring some home for lunch today.  Great for date night, lunch or with the family.  Chef Esteban serves up his delicious versions of mexican favorites."
26438,4,"So many great finds! Ive scored vintage items, hand crafted jewelry, and handmade clothing, bags, shoes, you name it! Every item is a show stopper or conversation piece."
439,3,"After having an awful, overpriced breakfast at the Courtyard Marriott - Charlotte City Center the morning before, I consulted Yelp to find a place within walking distance that wouldn't give me indigestion.\n\nI recommend the eggs benedict at the Monticell ($9). The eggs were poached perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was nicely seasoned and the cheese grits were a tasty side.\n\nThe service could have been a bit more attentive, and it's not cheap, but I would recommend the Monticello to anyone looking for a good breakfast in this part of Charlotte."
707,1,"You would think fried chicken would be simple... Absolutely horrible.  A night visit only added insult to injury. 3 waitresses and still had to return one drink for lack of alcohol. If you want to shoot pool, go during the day, otherwise, stay clear!!!\nPS: I had to remind them of the \""drink\"" to get it removed from the bill."
6337,2,"Thank goodness for Michaels!\n\nWhere the \""semi-creative\"" can actually pull something together and create a masterpiece. Haha! \n\nI was \""tasked\"" (ugh) to pick up supplies for our pumpkin contest at work. We had a \""theme\"" (kinda)...but no clue of how to make that happen. Thank goodness the staff was helpful! Walking into Michaels can be a bit overwhelming...ok, extremely overwhelming, especially with a not well thought out vision. However, I'm pleased to say I managed to leave with some good stuff and my co-workers were happy.  \n\nSo then why just three stars??? Simply put this store is just way too cluttered. It's not necessarily the fault of the staff, they really have no control of people leaving stuff just anywhere but it can make it hard finding what you need when you have to dig through cards, glitter ornaments, plastic flowers and stickers. \n\nBut if you are every tasks out for work projects, I definitely recommend stopping here to get the creative juices flowing."
8408,0,"ummm knife tears and bodily fluids on the pool table... when my group left (RIGHT after we walked in) on Friday night, there were exactly 46 cockroaches left in the bar to keep each other company... HORRIBLE would be a compliment. At least they (I mean HE) were showing Jim Rose circus tricks on the tv. somebody was puking up milk and re drinking it... I think he was on location at Rogue from the night before."
29103,3,"This is the best \""East Coast Style\"" Chinese food I have found in the area, and believe me, I have tried several. Wonton soup is fantastic. A large feeds 3 people. There's 10 wonton in a large. The sweet and sour pork is amazeballs. My bf tried the beef lo mein. He loved it. Mmmm, can't wait to go back again."
11517,2,"I have always got the pizza here take-out, but I'm sure there isn't a massive difference at all.  The pizza is good when you first start eating it, but don't let it get cold.  Something strange happens to it and the pizza becomes inedible to me.  And since pizza is one of maybe three foods I can eat that is a day or two old.  That is a big no no.  Despite that I'm sure the best thing to do at this place is to eat it fresh."
45364,4,"I am officially in love.  Sinful Sweets DESTROYS any chocolate/candy store in existence.  Not only do they have awesome, friendly, fun staff, but the expansive selection of chocolates, truffles, cake pops AND ice cream is fantastic.  They even have samples of their chocolate out to try!  Sure, the building this little place resides in may be a bit run down, but I think it just gives it personality!  The shop inside is cute and modern.  \n\nMilkshake Happy Hour (25% off from 4-7 p.m.)!!  The girl working (I wish I'd gotten her name!) was awesomely patient and helpful as I debated for several minutes between flavors.  Finally, I decided to go wild and got bittersweet symphony (coffee & chocolate), mint chocolate chip, red velvet, chocolate cookie dough & piece of cake (since you get four scoops of ice cream, I split the cake and cookie dough flavors).  At my request, she blended in tons of (free!) extras, like Reese's and Butterfingers pieces.  Finally, I asked her to top my shake with Andes mints, which she did enthusiastically.  It came with a big, fat cute straw DIPPED in chocolate on the tip for an extra burst of chocolately goodness with each sip.  She said it was the craziest shake she had made yet :)  \n\nIT WAS HEAVEN.  I'm surprised I didn't spiral into depression at the final sip.  All the extras that didn't get blended in were at the bottom, soaked in milkshakey goodness, so I got to spoon it out for even more deliciousness.\n\nGo here.  You will be addicted."
10538,4,"Pleasantly surprised.  The suite looks more like a condo than a hotel room. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to any reviews or my husband and I would've missed out. Loved the jacuzzi, double shower , even the living area. Everything felt very\"" home like\"" . The linen was trendy and the bed was comfy. The gym was also clean and well maintained. We will definitely stay here again."
35994,1,"Eh.\n\nIt was loud because of a live band....but completely empty at 11:30 PM on a Friday night.  I guess everyone was out and about in Vegas...but this place just wasn't that great.\n\nWorse, the promoter at the door gave our very large group cards for \""Buy 1 Get 1 Free.\""  So hey, why not, right?   But then come to find out, each drink costs between $9.50 and $11.00.  So....I get that you're in Vegas and you'll pay, one way or the other, but that seemed just a little outrageous.\n\nI slipped away after only fifteen minutes of watching a couple of old people dance to a cover of Footloose that the live band was playing and that was enough for me.  Thanks."
45962,1,Went last night based on favorable reviews. Ordered the special Tuna Tartar and got a tuna Salad. Then Specifically said do not bring the Tartar... Guess what brought that as well.. Truly a language barrier the rolls did not tasted right and my Tuna Sashimi was dry and fell apart as I picked it up.
27830,3,"Hmmm..............free food? Yes please! Well, technically I lost more on the table then what I was actually comped, but still it was free. \n\nStarter dish was a HUGE plate of chicken spring roll which was loosely wrapped, but the texture of the rice wrapper they used kept everything together. Moving onto entrees we ordered the chicken and braised short rib combination, spaghettini with clams, house chicken salad and the lasagna. \n\n#1 chicken was good, but braised short rib was a little too salty to my liking! (surprisingly)\n#2 Spaghettini with clams was best bang for the bucks! Little bit of noodles and CRAP load of clams\n#3 house chicken salad was drenched in dressing, not a big fan. \n#4 Lasagna........?????? must of been good because my boy ate every last bite of it without sharing! \n\nI would say it's above average as far as cafe food would go."
15917,3,"My favorite pizza in Madison, WI.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA?select=jRGZL2b1hdZcoZszIcBQRw\n\nI could care less if the pizza is pre baked and that the crust is meh. Did you see what was on my pizza?! And yes, that is all it takes to wow me sometimes. \n\nSo glad I got to have that pizza again after a 5 year hiatus."
10594,2,"It's a chain what do you expect? Anyway the place appears to have hardcore lines of families at any time of day when you're looking for a table. So it may not be the place for you if you want a quick bite to eat. But it was around 5 pm, and after having nothing but a protein shake and mcdonalds having spent all day at  the UFC weigh-ins...I was starving.  So I walked right into the bar and had a seat. \n\n  Bartender was nice, and quickly took my order. I went for the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes. It's hard to mess up anything deep fried and or full of butter....so my food was quite tasty and I did get it rather quickly. After that service pretty much disappeared for me. If that had not been the case I'd easily give this place four stars. Anyway the prices are fair, I think for the same price and assuming you're not with a family of kids...there are plenty of better options to eat in Vegas.\n\n~G"
14667,2,"We liked this place but it wasn't outstanding. My wife and I both had sliders, one of their specialties, and it was good. Not great. \n\nWe ordered their adult Mac and cheese too. The waiter commented on how that's what they're known for. We got our sliders. But we never got the Mac and cheese. \n\nWe were full by the time the waiter checked on us. I told him to cancel our Mac and cheese order."
19752,4,"In the best crate-digging tradition, Record City is an old, converted house that's filled to the gills with vinyl - Lps, picture discs, 45s, what have you, both new and used. \n\nI've been collecting for a very long time, and I love this place for a couple of reasons. First: quality. It's superb. Most vinyl is in near-perfect shape. If it's not, it's there because it's rare (like that Whispers Lp on Soul Clock that I found during my last visit). Second, selection: although the bulk of their vinyl is rock and R&B, there are smaller but respectable collections of jazz, country and classical. \n\nCool thing about record shopping in Vegas is that so many people come through there from all over. This makes for a lot of inventory change, all the time. And that's very cool. Unlike other local stores like Zia, you will come out of here with an armload rather than one or two Lps.\n\nNote that they close at 5PM and are NOT open on Sundays, so plan accordingly. Last time I was here, I came up with a half-dozen sealed early 70s Motown titles, a couple of hard to find Quads that i'd been searching for, and a ton of other cool goodies. Definitely worth the visit if you're in Sin City, with a better chance of a \""win\"" than any casino you might drop cash at ;)"
31296,0,Food was semi ok and they didn't refresh the trays of food as often as they should've but I guess for the cheap price that's the quality you get
5458,0,"Stopped in for a few slices after not dining here for several months because the pizza was so bad, and now I remember why I stopped eating here !! The pizza was soggy soaked in grease and just not good. The Pizza is just plain bad here, and even though this place is less then a minute from my house I will not be dining here anymore ..."
47686,4,"I'm not one to write reviews but I had to stop what I was doing to let you know how amazing Leah Joy is!!!\nNeed a last minute blow out, make up or color??? Leah Joy is the go to gal to make you feel beautiful. I love the fact that she is mobile and will come to you at a moments notice. She is incredible with an extension blow out (girls, please don't try to do this on your own, it's just not worth it). Want to look like a million bucks??? Cal Leah Joy ASAP!!!\nMake sure you get the \""beachy waves\"" blow out; there is honestly nothing better. She knows how to work the curling iron better than anyone I know. And my blow out can last almost a week. So what are you waiting for??? Make that call, you deserve this special treat, or in my case... Twice a week treat. Now, aren't you worth that??? look and feel your best, Leah Joy is the only person in the valley to call."
48610,2,Food was good but it all came out 5-10min apart. Actually had to have one dish wrapped up because it never came out. The rice was good and so was the hummus. Will go back but gonna wait a while to see if they get it together
25543,3,"Great little theater in montreal...not only do they show some pretty cool movies, but it's way cheaper than the standard theaters..\n\nalso, note the Metro grocery store right next door, great place to stock up before the movie :)"
37717,1,"\""Meh. I've experienced better.\""\n\nThere have been people who have been persuading me to go here, convincing me its going to be revolutionary for a burger joint. Seeing as how burgers are generally redundant as is to me, I decided to take a shot. \n\nThe only thing I've found good was the mint milkshake, and that was it. Fries were bland, meat was bland, the whole burger was nothing special. I think their sauces actually attempt to make up for how bland their patties are, because honestly I could have gotten the same stuff for $3 cheaper elsewhere. \n\nThe location is fairly busy, and because of this, a little bit of a wait for both seating and take-out. The staff is fairly friendly and attentive. I don't see what is so great about Steak 'N Shake, it really wasn't anything special to myself."
4838,1,"Walked in to pick something up from the ship to store department, and the register is closed but next to it is layway and there were 5 people in line and the gentlemen at the register said that the other lane/register is closed.  I told him \""call for help then, because I'm not here for layway\""  2 other ladies in line agreed and said they were waiting too because no one would come help him.   Well it happened that we were near the employee back entrance or something and I told someone in that back hallway to immediately go call someone to help this guy out because we are not all here for layaway and no one is helping him.  Within 2 minutes someone came to help him.   They were still a little slow but not nearly as bad as before.  It still took almost 30 min from the time I came in, to the time I finally got my 2 items and they allowed me to pull around back to pick it up because it was too large to wheel through the store on a flatbed cart.  \n\nNot necessarily poor service but definitely LACK OF HELP to properly take care of customers!"
26598,4,"Great service, atmosphere, and food! Loved the gluten free options! Awesome experience!"
38704,1,"Came to Magpie with great expectations but no reservation.\nTime was around 6 PM the restaurant was relatively empty, even so, we were sent to the bar. Several minutes later after I had received my thimble size glass of wine for $9.50, another couple came in who had no reservations--yet were seated at a table in the relatively open restaurant.  I removed 2 stars just for the ineffective table management (yes, I know it's always best to have a reservation)\n\nPizza -   was delivered fairly promptly with tasty sauce. There is nothing like a true Wood-fire oven for Pizza, and Magpie has one.   I chose the margarita pizza with added anchovies and a handful of rocket greens on top.  the pizza was good but the crust was not quite as good as what I found at Bottega - in little Italy.  The hipster setting of Mile End is what it is and the staff were nice. For me still, the best real- Italian pizza experience is at  Bottega. I find them to be the winner.  Value for Money was not there with Magpie.  Wine / cocktails were way over priced for what you get, however the mixed cocktails were well put together."
43719,3,"We went for Happy Hour a few weeks ago.  We ordered 10 tapas off the Happy Hour menu.    Sushi rolls were half off.  The plates came within minutes of each other that we felt rushed and could not enjoy each plate.  We ended up with so many plates on our table so fast.   Again, I had to ask for some serving spoons.\n\nRock Shrimp Salad: found only on the Happy Hour menu. Rock shrimp in a mayo dressing served on a bed of spring mix.   I would order this again.\n\nFish Tacos: 2 panko crusted basa fillets topped with blood orange slaw.  I did not try this since there were only 2 tacos and 4 of us.\n\nKahana Chicken: Chicken thighs marinated in a special marinade served on a bed of shredded raw cabbage.\n\nNasu Fries: Panko crusted eggplant served with a Wasabi lime dipping sauce.  I liked this tapas.\n\nSoft shell crab: Soft shell crab served with a ponzu dipping sauce. I did not try this dish.\n\nSpicy Garlic Edamame: Edamame sauteed with garlic.  They were so so.\n\nKaiser Bowls Roll: Snow crab with yum yum mayo, ah\u00ed tuna, mango, ichimi ponzu.  This was a very pretty roll.  There was plenty of diced mango on top.\n\nYokohama Roll: cucumber wrap, salmon, avocado, snow crab, lemon, kaiware, ichimi ponzu.  This roll was difficult to eat with the cucumber wrap.  It fell apart.\n\nWaimea Roll: Soft shell crab, gobo, avocado, kaiware, unagi sauce.  I would order this roll again on the Happy Hour menu.\n\nVelzyland: Shrimp tempura, snow crab, unagi, avocado, unagi sauce.  i would order this roll again.\n\nI still really like this place, but the timing of the plates coming out was too fast.  Next time I would order a few tapas at a time.\n\nThey did have Last Call for Happy Hour, so we could have ordered more plates if we wanted to."
13542,1,"Never again.\n\nThe day before going to Pure, a promoter standing around Caesar's palace talked to us and put our party on some kind of \""guest list.\""  He was cool about everything and actually got our hopes up that it would be a fun night.\n\nThe next night, we all arrived around 11pm and we were told to go through the \""VIP entrance\"" - but it was actually a gigantic crowd of people packed around probably the three worst bouncers in all of Las Vegas.  It took us about 30 minutes to get to the front of the crowd, and the bouncer we talked to \""Lloyd\"" promised us we'd get in soon.  Ok, I don't mind waiting a little bit since its supposed to be a nice club.  Plus we had a good mix (4 girls, 2 guys) so I didnt think we'd have to wait too long.\n\nWe ended up waiting for a damn hour at the front of the entrance before they finally let us in.  That full hour was spent crushed in the crowd and watching Lloyd let other more important people push ahead of us, and the bouncers telling us to make room for these people (as though we could move anywhere at all).  The regular line looked like it was moving swiftly which added insult to our situation.  \n\nFinally, one of the managers \""Sheets\"" saw that we'd been waiting for an exorbitant amount of time and told Lloyd to let us in next.  Our being on the \""guest list\"" no longer mattered since by this time it was past 12, thus we were charged the full admission like chumps (even though we had \""reduced admission past 12\"" cards).  We could have waited in the regular line and saved much more time.\n\nThat whole admission experience left me bitter as hell, and pretty much tainted what could have been a fun night.  We came up with all sorts of theories.  Like maybe they didn't want too many Asians inside.  Or maybe because we didn't tip Lloyd while we were standing there.  Who knows.\n\nAnyway, the music was pretty good, DJ AM was spinning, and he played a good mix of old school hip-hop and some mainstream stuff.  The view from the balcony is really nice too.  There was an overall vibe of douchey-ness to the crowd as well as the bouncers -- they tried to charge us an extra $5 to get into another room that had live dancers, wtf?  And Lloyd, true to his douchey nature, yelled at one of our group for standing outside the exit as she was waiting for the rest of us to come out.\n\nDon't really know how the table / bottle service is, but I honestly don't plan on going back."
1592,4,"Why more [places like this don't exist in AZ, I'll never know.  If you're looking for that old Europe feel, this is an excellent choice.  Although this spot is awesome at any time of the year, I think when the weather turns cooler, this is like a trip to your fantasy of an Olde English Public House.  There is an upstairs restaurant and a downstairs cellar bar. I'll be focusing on the Cellar bar.\n\nDownstairs is amazing. There are/were only a couple bars in PHX that I can think of that were underground and this is one of them. It's swanky, candle-lit, and it has some of the best happy hour specials I've ever experienced. Their \""small plate's\"" are truly some of the finest creations I've ever had for the price.  I would recommend trying them all out eventually, but start with one or two. For $5 during happy hour, they can't be beat.\n\nAs for the drinks, there are two times where you can seriously get your money's worth.  On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday all bottles of wine are 1/2 price.  And they have some excellent wines. The other time is regular happy hour all week from 3-6.  For me, it's all about going on a Sun, Mon or Tues during HH! 1/2 of bottles of wine, cocktail specials AND $5 small plates. I'll call it budget-swank. Excellent experience for not too much money./Art"
21410,3,"I'm like Penny Lane x; that I wouldn't have tried this place if it wasn't for YELP!!! - Now, I am a fan; only been there 1 time; but this place has delicious, Singapore Rice Noodles (a entree I seen to judge all dim sum places on) - the portion easier feeds 2-3 people and runs higher than normal dim sum prices (but, it well worth it)...All of the other dim sum items were great that I tried.  Go early, because we got there at 11AM and 15-30 minutes later there was almost no tables/booths left."
30521,4,Absolutely great!!  Food is delicious and everyone is friendly. Whether it's lunch or dinner they have a great selection. Best Korean BBQ place and been to in Vegas and the best price
13796,1,I would definitely check this off the list and not go back. Food was not enjoyable. There were 7 of us and it was our last stop from our 24 hour Vegas buffet pass. None of us finished our food and hardly went back for seconds.
20523,1,"We got here at 11:30am for a late breakfast and were seated within 10 minutes. \n\nThe drinks took longer to come out than our wait for the table. After ordering and waiting about 15 minutes they refilled our drinks and the waitress mentioned that since we ordered french toast it will take longer. \n\nA whopping 25 minutes later we get our food (total of 40 min wait) we get our food. The waitress even says to us \""you guys must've been starving with how long your food took.\"" NO KIDDING. \n\nThe food ended up being just Ok. Will not be coming back here.."
24063,3,"Most amazing hotel pool I've ever seen!  My room had a great view of the pool so before heading to work I would wish I was going there.\n\nLove the variety of pools - wave pool, lazy river, regular pools.  Wow!\n\nTons of lounge chairs to hang out.  Special cabanas for a price (not sure what that price is).\n\nAt the entrance you get a towel and they advise you that alchol is not allowed even though the waiter at the restaurant nearby sold you an overpriced margarita to go...  we just denied we had alchol and were let in (the young guy at the door didn't seem to care but still that waiter knew we were going to the pool so I'm not sure why he told us to get a margarita if you really shouldn't bring them in).\n\nAnyway, my only real complaint is the hours.  I wished it was open longer, especially in the morning before work when it's sunny out."
31611,3,"I have tried this place twice now and I think it is great. The dogs are giant and the toppings are plentiful. The first trip me and my boyfriend ordered chili cheese fries which were huge, we both got plain hot dogs and topped them with the chili and cheese from the fries, there was more than enough! The place was only open a couple weeks and had a special where you could get a hot dog and beer for like $8 I think. The second trip they didn't have the hot dog and beer special so we were kind of disappointed. I would give them 5 stars if they brought back the hot dog/beer combo. Overall, great tasting dogs!"
30010,0,Terrible customer service. Lazy staff. Don't waste your time going here. 90th and Shea store is a little more helpful but staff isn't very knowledgeable on their product line. You're probably better off shopping online and doing it all on your own. In store pick up is at least convenient.
6503,4,"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  Delicious food, yummy drinks, friendly staff."
25359,3,"While on Montreal for business for a few days and staying in the old town, I have bumped into this traditional polish restaurant for a casual dinner.\n\nThis is an old school classic eastern european restaurant that has lots of tradition and less novelty. \n\nThe food now, what can I say? good borsh (sour beet soup), really good pierogi (which is the polish equivalent for ravioli), an excellent polish sausage and some mighty fine polish and Lithuanian beer were sampled.\n\nbottom line: everything was good and service was great!\n\nThe atmosphere is very warm, the owners and the people who work there all speak polish, French and English. the place is very warm and features live piano on evenings."
44955,4,"Man oh man is this place ever good!! We've made three visits now and the pizza and salads have just been exceptional each time. Great service and there is something really special about the ambience. The first time we came in, there were not one but two young ladies behind the counter with bouffant hairdos and intense winged eyeliner...and then the mix of 70's music, big band stuff and Italian pop playing in the background just sends it over the edge for me:)\nI highly recommend the Roma pizza with extra garlic, but you can hardly go wrong picking your own toppings. (Don't be too skeptical of the cracked egg on top- it's yummy!!)\nKid-friendly but would also be a super date night with the wine bar, gelato station and the yummy cannolis and cappuccinos to round out your evening.\nPS Very impressed on our second visit as the manager gave us one extra cappuccino for free (the first was free with a yelp check-in) and then came over to the table to see how we were doing, chat about the pizza and personally clear away dishes. Super nice!"
34878,0,"Not juicy, too small and not worth it\n\nThe place is tiny!! Definitely not worth to pay for the day pass. The massage I got here was good but felt like it wasn't enough. \n\nI had the 50 minutes massage but felt like a 40 minute massage. The masseuse hands felt very strong and it was a good massage overall. \n\nThe jacuzzi was small. The sauna and steam room felt mediocre. The whole was was very small. They also had a co-ed meditation room where I fell asleep."
7570,4,Best doughnuts in Chandler. Fresh doughnuts made throughout the day. Every drink under the sun besides coffee.
5003,4,"Best vegetarian \""meat\"" sandwiches I've had out. Got a veg cheesesteak (morning star chicken shreds) and a turkey and slaw (sliced smoked soy based turkey of some sort). Fan. Tas. Tic. Good bread, good portions, great veg meat, polite staff...I wish there was one of these near my home town. I would eat here every night. $13 for a 20\"" sub just can't be beat."
20918,1,"Finally got to Greenberg's for their Pastrami Sandwich.  As I watched the little lady do the slicing, I was thinking, man, she is piling it on. My mouth was watering with anticipation. When she placed it on the counter, that pastrami was bulging all outside that rye bread like a fat lady in tight spandex.  Man I was ready! Then I bit into it.  Where was that  Pastrami flavor? I salted. I mustard it up, to no avail. Where was that peppery taste?There was also a fatty taste that lingered all up in my mouth. I checked the meat and there was the normal amount of fat to it. I couldn't figured it out. What happened to all the hype about this deli? Maybe it was a just a funky slab that day. I will give it another try, because you can't beat that meat pile up  for Ten Bucks."
27100,1,"I went here in a bid to support a smaller coffee shop than the multinational Starbucks, Chocolate Soup's neighbour on Hunter's Square.\n\n\n Oops, mistake. There were 2 people in front, yet was ignored for 5 minutes, and waited 10 for the order. A polite 'Will the coffee be much longer, please?' was met with breathtaking rudeness, at a very loud volume, by the supervisor.\n\n\n But at least it stopped her bullying the hard-working barista for a moment.\n\n\n He, and the decent macchiato he made, were the only saving grace, and get a star each.\n\n\n I've worked in coffee shops before, so I'm perfectly aware of the stress and demands of the job, but equally aware of the importance of customer service. I sincerely hope this problem has been rectified.\n\n\n Until then, Starbucks it is."
38394,1,"I have tried to build my own burger, and even tried one of the featured Wagyu burgers.  As far as burger's go, it might be that I just haven't hit the right combination yet, but 5 Guys has a tastier burger by far with much less effort in combining such varied toppings.  There are MANY (possibly too many) choices for toppings.  Some of them don't make sense (poblano peppers AND roasted reds?), some of them are pleasant surprises (fire roasted tomatoes).  The rubs don't add much variance from one to the next.\n\nWhere Burgatory shines is their fries, house-made oils that they use for toppings  on the fries, nachos, and burgers, and their milk shakes are the best I've EVER had.  Granted, I'm not a huge ice cream fan, but I am 38 years old, and I've had my share of milk shakes.\n\nHonestly, the local hype hurts the restaurant in my opinion.  Wait times for a table exceed 1 hour from 3-4pm onward (I've never been there earlier than 3pm.)  The wait certainly builds expectations.  If you allow this to happen unchecked, you'll likely be disappointed as there isn't much special about Burgatory's food.\n\nOne positive is the staff at the Waterworks location (the only one I've been to).  I have never had a server that seems put out by their job.  They've always been free with suggestions (when asked), attentive, and seemingly caring about your experience.\n\nSo...if you're impressed by sheer selection, quality presentation, decent beef, and hype, Burgatory is for you.  If you want a good burger, don't try so hard.  Stick with the basics and try 5 Guys or even Mario's on the South Side."
12106,1,"Everyone has been telling me for weeks that since we now live in SouthEnd, we need to walk down to Ru San's.  We did... and likely won't very often.\n\nWe strongly prefer the normal size sushi and aren't fans of paying for a more expensive roll only to find out that it has more rice than the other rolls.  If a piece of sushi takes more than a bite, I'm not as big on it.  I like a roll to encapsulate all the flavors, not to get a little of this and a little of that in two bites.  That being said, wasn't a fan of the 'Dancing Eel'.  \n\nService was definitely sub par and the place is crazy noisy.  We plan to go back another time and will try the outdoor seating.  Also, the protein bomb looks great as it's hard to screw up nagiri.  The Cowboy was okay and the dumplngs were average dumplings.  \n\nWith better service, extract the noise, and ordering different things, there is still a chance for good food here.  I'm a firm believer in 2nd and 3rd chances.  Check out the photos for what we ate!"
26808,4,"Oh BLT how I love thee. You are one of those restaurants that my mind wonders to on a hungry day. You are a restaurant that I think about when I want a restaurant with an atmosphere and view of Camelback Mountain. And with your bar and indoor/outdoor seating arrangements, you are the perfect place to enjoy a meal on a warm or cool day.\n\nI've dined at BLT twice and I think I will be setting up a sleeping bag and just living there from now on. Most recently, I went last night for my birthday. When asked to pick my restaurant poison for the unbirthday celebration, I didn't have to think twice before saying BLT. I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was full with people but not overly crowded. Our table was ready upon arrival and situated just by the patio and overlooking the mountains so a perfect mixture of indoor outdoor seating. The service was a bit on the slow side but I enjoyed that since this was a leisurely dinner and not one you want to get rushed. The waiter definitely gave us our time. After beginning with wine (a must at a Steakhouse of course), we were served my very favorite classic starter -- popovers! They were large in charge and full of buttery taste. I could probably go back for the popovers alone. For the meal, my table chose between the classic steak and the sole. I went with the sole and to insert much needed awful puns here...I felt the soul train after just one bite! How do I describe it. Upon taking a bite, I tasted candied pecan. As random as it sounds, it tasted delicious. It was a good amount of sole and due to the heaviness of the sauce (delicious sauce by the way), I couldn't finish it as much as I tried. I know I'll be dreaming about the sole for years to come. Plus, since this is not a restaurant you visit for a random Tuesday night and the dollar signs exceed $$$, I will be dreaming for awhile but it's a good memory to have! \n\nMoving on to dessert, we tasted a bit of everything and the cheesecake was tasty. I ordered an apple crisp tart and it was ok, but the entree was definitely the highlight of the evening. The only awkward moment of the night was that since it was my birthday, my table apparently tried to tell the staff three times and put the note on the reservation. But, alas three reminders later, still no birthday candle on a dessert (which was fine by me since I like to avoid the birthday if at all possible but my table wouldn't let it slide.) Finally after one final awkward reminder, just as we were ready to go and plates had practically been cleared, a random chocolate souffle appeared with happy birthday. Still no candle and the moment was kind of over but the thought still counts. So I'd probably say this was a great birthday spot for me since I don't enjoy the birthday candle as much, but if you visit and that's important to you, you may want to get on that as early in the dinner as possible! \n\nNow that I am officially full for the weekend, I will never forget my great birthday experience at BLT and I definitely think this is a restaurant you should consider for a special occasion. \n\nOne last thing -- the mixologist for cocktails is amazing and she knows her bourbon, so if she's working the night you visit, definitely ask her for a special drink!"
30378,4,OMB best place for relaxing after work. Copper is the best beer I've ever had.
260,3,"I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit, I was wrong... Until tonight.  I have found that every Italian restaurant I've tried has left much to be desired; from Del's atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar, I had not found an Italian joint I liked.\n\nLombardozzi, I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight.  I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them, but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal.\n\nWe started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection, and no rubbery feel, which is a positive, because 99% of places outside the east coast can't to calamari to save their lives.\n\nI had the gnocchi with red sauce (only sauce option which kind of irks me, because gnocchi is great with a pesto) with meatballs.  The gnocchi is homemade and to die for, and the sauce is pretty good too (I'm a sauce snob, nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers) and the meatballs were as good as I remembered.\n\nGreat food experience, but the service was at best bad.  The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order, and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing.\n\nI will be back, because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi."
30034,1,"Came here because we got $100 dining credit from our hotel. Upon entrance, place is really modern and reaallllyyy nice and upscale. So we also expected the food to be just as nice plus delicious.\n\nThe $100 was split among 4 ppl.... when we looked at the menu, it was only enough for about 3 entrees or 4 appetizers, and that is NOT enough for 4 people!! And the portion was very very small. The price is RIDICULOUS for what you get.\n\nWe ordered the yellowtail with scallion roll, salmon roll, kobe beef udon, chicken karaage, kobe beef fried rice, and salmon sashimi. The rolls were cut into 8 tiny pieces; taste was so so; price was $18 each. I had bigger and better rolls back home for half the price. The udon was delicious according to my friend, so I guess that's that. The fried rice was waaaay too salty, tender meat tho. The sashimi was ONE piece of fish the size of my small toe at $6. Seriously? After we finished our meals, we headed to Hooters for some 25-cent wings because we were still hungry after spending $180 here (they charged water and that's around $3 per person). I have to say I was more satisfied with the food at Hooters than here.\n\nConclusion: I'll never come here ever again. Total rip off, service was so so (they forgot my sashimi order, I had to ask for it), food was NOT worth the price."
30271,0,So dirty I was afraid to take my shoes off. Is there a way to give a quarter star?
2559,2,"Dude, this place ain't half bad and I didn't even have the munchies!  You don't have to be stoned here to enjoy the food.\n\nA variety of sandwiches and such served up with a smile and a side of chips or something.  Doritos anyone?"
17203,2,"I love greek food, and I love big portions, but yet I would still just rate this place 3 stars. The best part was our starter, which was the hummus sampler. Each hummus was tasty and flavorful. They were sort of skimping on the pita bread, but did not hesitate to bring us more when we asked. I ordered the falafel gyro, and it was good, but not great. I've definitely had better- even at the chain Pita Jungle. My dad ordered the Moussaka, and he thought it was delicious. Maybe if I come back, I will order that instead? My favorite part of the meal, as ridiculous as it sounds, was the massive water glasses. I guess I consume a lot of water with my meals, and always feel like I have to bug the servers to bring me more. Well that's definitely not an issue here! Overall, A-OK pretty much sums it up."
17115,3,"So we stopped in here for some Dim Sum Cantonese Style. \n\nAfter only 2 carts, I was able to get all of my favorites.  I love it because all you have to do is point and they serve it to you. It helps that I speak Cantonese, so I was able to request my favorite, but I can see how this would be frustrating to others who are not familiar with Dim Sum. \n\nYes, they do have chicken feet.\n\nUnless you can read Chinese, chances are you won't be able to read the check and know exactly how much it will cost you, or know the actual name of the item that you ordered. Meh.  Sometime's I'd rather not know. \n\nI thought this was a great place for Dim Sum, but it certainly is not a good place for Dim Sum beginners without an old Chinese person or a seasoned Dim Sum eater."
36712,2,This place allows smoking which being from California is absolutely uncool. That being said there is a section that allows for non-smoking patrons. Once they open the side door it helped a lot with the smoke. The food was good the Monday night football was also great because they have a huge wide screen projector on the main floor. I would've given this place for stars but being from California I can't stand cigarette smoke it makes my eyes burn. Our waitress was great and was very attentive.
642,3,"I visit often.  Love the white salsa, great food, good prices."
4325,2,"Pretty good pizza.  This place isn't far from my house, so I'll probably go back.  Not as good as my beloved Grimaldi's, but it's plenty good for the price."
30409,1,"Food was no better than adequate.  Service was worse.  Waiter did not speak English well, so our order was messed up.  One hour time limit.  Everything tasted of ginger, and more than just a hint of it. Atmosphere wasn't very good.  Poor lighting makes it difficult to read menu.  We will not be going back, even though it is very close to home."
10460,3,"I've been to Ruth's Chris about six or seven times in three different states, and All I can say is, when you franchise restaurants out to individual owners, you get a pretty inconsistant product.\n\nThe two here are okay.   I prefer the one near the palms because they get more interesting clientele.\n\nThe food is good and the service is prompt.  I always sit at the bar, but did have a large party here for 15 people, and we were treated well.\n\nThe bar is open late, and they servefood almost until the end."
21418,1,"Speak up if you want a drink before you've dropped $300 in the machines. It's pretty hard to get served. -especially after 10pm, even if its not busy. When you do get your drink, you may want to order a double b/c it's gonna be a short jigger of whatever you ask for. \nThe only reason I give this the 2 stars is because they have a really great \""Rooster\"" salad.\nUnfortunately most of the regulars don't seem like the kind of people that eat much. They seem more like the kind of people that took a break from feverishly cleaning their grout & thought they would take their teeth grinding out in public... Very intense. Lol"
19325,0,"Today I was looking for a new phone.  Getting a new phone and plan is already a headache as there are so many hidden fees in plans. Claudia roman was my retail representative and she was extremely condescending and rude. Sprint already has terrible service, they don't have the luxury\n to be ass holes, especially when you say your considering a new carrier."
21959,4,"Don't really need to say much here, as 2000+ reviews at a 4.5 star average speaks for itself. I was out all night and was too tired to go out for lunch with my friends, but they were kind enough to bring me an Earl's Club back. It was probably a good hour or so by time they ordered it to the time they brought it back to me, but the sandwich was still warm and delicious! I can't imagine how much better it would be fresh! For $6, this is a freaking steal compared to a lot of the more expensive food options in Vegas. Couple that with the fact that it's open 24 hours, and this place is money."
32234,0,"My family and I have been to this location several times and it's always an adventure. The staff seems clueless about their jobs, they mess the order up and they have no regard that the customer is watching all of this. I need to find a different location and let the keystone cops have this location"
38439,0,"I ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza for carry out. It was done on time, however, they used canned mushrooms and ruined a promising pizza. The pizza also had a salty taste, was very dry and cost $14.21, which is the most I've paid for a 2-topping medium pizza in a long time. And good luck getting any menu info on the web-site. Click on appetizers and it brings up salads. No prices are listed and no pictures of the food except cover-shots on the hone page.\n\nI had a bad feeling about it when I placed my order and I couldn't understand the person on the phone. It sounded like they answered saying 'hello' and I had to confirm this was Palermo's Pizza. I told them what I wanted and they said 'ok bye' and then realized they hadn't got my phone number and asked for it. Then said 'ok bye' again without telling me how long it would take. So I asked 20-30 minutes? They said 'yes. ok bye.'\n\nI figured it must have been busy. I went in to pick up my pizza and there were only 4 customers in the place with 2 visible employees. \n\nIts ironic that I paid extra for an added topping (mushrooms) that not only cost me more, but ruined the pizza. Whatever amount of money they are saving using canned ingredients instead of fresh, they just lost 100x fold in my future business. I'll be looking elsewhere for a true New York style pizza. This isn't it."
7301,1,"This hotel was busy during the weekend I visited, and at times the front desk was short staffed. Noise in the rooms from nearby I-17 was a problem. There are so many hotels in this area, I'll stay somewhere else in the future."
5025,3,"Ordered hot rock bi bim bap...tasty, but probably wouldn't order again. I'll try the bulgogi next time...or maybe the meat jun. Kimchi was delicious! Filled up on all the wonderful appetizers before I got my main dish. Ordered manju to go, but ended up eating half before i left as it was so tasty! Owners were welcoming and helpful. I did have to wait for a bit for service as they were so busy, bur it was worth the wait. Will eat there every trip to Vegas from now on. Probably one of the best hole in the wall, and Korean style restauran I've been to."
14277,2,"Lasagna entree - $15\nBottle of meritage - $32\nTiramasu - $6\nSmelling cigar smoke, hearing a car alarm, and listening to somebody with whooping cough - Priceless\n\nWhere's the half-star when you really need it?! Veneto is stuck in the middle, between 3 and 4. So, do I round up or round down? Such a tough decision. I can't rate this 5 like other people, for I did not think the food was 5-star worthy. However, based on other factors, the rating of this place deserves more than 3 stars... yet doesn't quite reach 4. Allow me to explain. \n\nAtmosphere is 2-star worthy. Sure, sitting on their patio, tucked in the corner, makes for an intimate time with your date. Unless, of course, a car alarm goes off or you have to deal with a person coughing one of those rib-rattling coughs. You know the kind. Not to mention, people standing outside the \""Veneto patio perimeter\"" to talk loudly on their cell phones. However, inside the patio, patrons were respectable. The occasional loud, inebriated table does not a bad experience make. \n\nPrice deserves 5 stars. With two entrees and a fantastic dessert, price came to $45. That's pretty great for two people. Throw in a bottle of wine, though, and you're looking at an $80 tab, before tip, which means you're really looking at a $100 tab (atleast), for service definitely deserves a generous gratutity!\n\nService definitely deserves 5 stars. Our waiter was top-notch. Very conversational, friendly, professional and attentive. He recommended a bottle of wine that would suit both a meat-focused entree (lasagna), as well as a fish dish. The wine - lyreth meritage from Sonoma - was smooth, silky and a perfect dance partner to both our dishes. \n\nDessert deserves 4 stars. Never before had my date seen Tiramasu served with two sauces on top. It's almost like the piece itself was divided into two tiny countries. One sauce was chocolate. The other was espresso-based. I could have just had spoonfuls of the latter and been quite content. However, the tiramasu was heavenly. \n\nDecor deserves a 3, I think. Especially since the music they played didn't match the intimate and unique dining experience they offer here. It was too pop-ish and loud, even from sitting outside. When my date and I excused ourselves to the lavatories, we noticed semi-guady decor, high-back booths, rich creams and rubies throwing themselves against the walls. It wasn't a stomach-turning touch. Just a bit over done. A simple, clean layout would have done wonders for this place. Not to mention maybe a more subtle bar - without a blaringly bright TV set. \n\nFood deserves 3 stars. It doesn't deserve any more than that. At least not the entrees we had. My date had the special, which came with mussels, crab meat, salmon, etc. in a pasta bowl with a damn fine light and flavorful sauce. I ordered the lasagna, which was a generous portion. Upon first bite, I couldn't place the taste. I had had it before! Given some time, I realized why I felt like this lasagna could be a new comfort food. It reminded me of when I was 8 and my mom would make me Chef Boyardee ravioli. The meat sauce of this lasagna tasted just like the ravioli sauce I used to love as a child. But, let's face it, I didn't go to Veneto to satisfy my 8-year-old self. I came to impress my adult self and enjoy a lovely night out with a wonderful man. My date even said later that it did, in fact, taste like the canned ravioli. He just didn't want to say anything at dinner for concern of insulting me or the lasagna. (Poor lasagna...)\n\nHaving eaten at Veneto this past weekend, I sit here and reflect upon the place. While there, I definitely thought this was a 4 star place. Now, however, I can't convince myself that I would ever go back. And I reserve 4 and 5 stars for places that hook me, that become places I crave, places I want to experience again and again... as well as places that leave a lasting impression. To me, Veneto's lasting impression expired Saturday at the stroke of midnight.\n\nOver all, I think Veneto is a great place to dine. Don't get me wrong. This place is a hidden gem, for the service, the price and the overall experience make this place worthwhile. Just don't expect an \""Oh My God\"" moment from your food... or expect to dine in peace from the noise of street traffic, car alarms and awful music."
340,2,"I think it's the lack of breakfast places in Pittsburgh that makes Pamela's so popular. I couldn't find anything special here except the value. You really get a lot of food for you money, and it's pretty good food, but it's not spectacular. I'll go on a weekday, but the wait on weekends isn't worth it. I can just stay home and eat cereal, thank you."
6388,1,I feel like the quality of this place has gone downhill slightly over the years. More globbed on sauces and general blandness. Meh.
26490,1,"On a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'aller au Muru au vu des commentaires positifs. On est dimanche l'endroit est plein mais on arrive \u00e0 avoir une table pour 6 assez rapidement, point positif.

Et malheureusement les d\u00e9ceptions vont s'encha\u00eener, \u00e0 commencer par l'attente interminable (probablement du au manque d'employ\u00e9, 1 seule serveuse et probablement pas plus en cuisine jusqu'\u00e0 13h ...). Ensuite par les plats, avec du pain sec, pas d'assaisonnement ou de sauce avec \u0153ufs/patate. Cr\u00eape peu copieuse pour 15$ hors taxe. Et un pain dor\u00e9e vraiment d\u00e9cevant sec et go\u00fbtant uniquement l'\u0153uf, tr\u00e8s loin d'un bon pain perdu ...

16022,2,"Parking was confusing.  I saw the place on the corner but where in the heck do I park?  I drove around and found parking in the back (on Ash).  They valid that lot so park there.  \n\nWe were greeted right away.  This place is HUGE!  We sat on the side that you can watch Mill Ave.  Pretty cool!  I ordered off the lunch menu:  CRISPY HONEY CHICKEN LUNCH (My favie) with brown rice.  It was ok, not sweet at all?  The egg drop soup was good.  The service from the wait staff was excellent.  I was just very disappointed in the honey chicken this time.  Sorry only 3 stars."
46762,2,"My go to place for soup dumplings in Vegas.. The only other place I've tried was China Mama and I thought the XLBs were way better here! However, for the last two times I've been there, the XLBs were so big that they were all stuck together in the steamer and it was like playing XLB jenga to try to pick up a piece of XLB without breaking the skin. As any XLB connoisseur would know, you might as well just not eat the XLB if the skin breaks and all the soup is wasted. I mentioned this to the server, and he just said \""yeah... Because they are bigger\"". Well duh. \n\nAnyways, it was good while it lasted. I will be searching out other places to satisfy my XLB cravings. And if I can't find any other good places, I might come back here one day and pray that their XLBs are no longer stuck together."

I am pretty skeptical about any Asian restaurant in Pittsburgh since I haven't found any 'real' ones like those in New York, Boston and Maryland. \n\nHowever, when seeing big bowls with 'nothing' but chilies, we thought, \""Hey this must be good!\"" We got even more excited when we saw the menu--a ton of Sichuan food to choose from. \n\nDespite the long wait time, we got our table as soon as patrons left and ordered the Chongqing chicken, which turned out to be very popular, and a slightly milder fish dish. It didn't take too long for the food to come despite the busy time. And the food were delicious! We have been to several Sichuan restaurants, and we have to say that How Lee is one of those that we would go back to again and again. :) \n\nSo if you're looking for GREAT Chinese food, check out How Lee! My husband and I look forward to trying other stuff on their menu (oh yeah, they also have non-Sichuan food which seem to be the 'non-spicy' ones.)"
32020,2,"Yummy, but not what I think of when I think of a \""BBQ\"" place. Definitely more upscale than your average barbecue joint. I actually felt a little weird picking up my ribs with my hands to eat them(When we are jonesin' for some Q, we usually go to Smoky Jon's, which is your \""paper towels on the table, get down and messy\"" kind of place).\n\nAnyhow, everything was decent. They have a two meat combo, which is nice when you want a little of this, and a little of that. I got the ribs and sausage. Ribs were really yummy, and the sausage while good, was unexpected--with a mustard sauce and lightly pickled peppers on top. Not your average style barbecue. The man had a pulled pork sandwich, juicy...but too smoked for my taste.\n\nThey serve all three of their sauces with the meal. Our fave was the molasses based sauce, hands down. The vinegar was okay, and the mustard \""barbecue sauce\"" just seemed like tasty mustard. Eh. \n\nI chose the cheese grits, which were good...but fluffier in texture than I'm used to. The server recommended the roasted veggie pasta salad, which was average(not that it mattered, I was too full to eat it anyhow). \n\nReally torn between three and four stars. We'd like to check it out upstairs, so we'll be back!"
23396,0,"Tick, tock. Tick tock. This line is not moving. Tick, tock. But ooooh, I think I'm still drunk and I NEED this coffee. Tick, tick, tick.

Omg, now I have to pee!! Tick. Tock. Tick. This is torture. Tock.\n\nFINALLY, it's my turn!  But wait... Out of croissants? And there's no wifi?? Seriously, you don't accept your own Starbucks cards?!? Well you didn't have to be rude about it. Time's up, this place is an absolute waste."
32084,2,"I'm giving it 3 stars almost solely on decor & atmosphere. \n\nAfter reading all of the rave reviews I really expected to be amazed, but sadly, that didn't happen. \n\nI did get a nonfat chai latte instead of coffee, so maybe that has something to do with it. It was kind of bland, nothing special :( \n\nBut like I said, the company was good, the atmosphere nice & I love the look of the place :) \n\nIf I try it again I'll try the coffee,,, I don't think I want to repeat my chai experience."

22458,4,"One of the very best restaurants in Vegas. A true hidden gem!\n\nWhy go to Le Circ or Bouchon and pay overinflated prices for a fine French meal, when you can go to Pamplemousse for half the price and have a true French experience?\n\nIt doesn't look like much from the street, but walk inside and you will be instantly transported to Paris.\n\nThe food is unrivaled IMHO. I highly recommend the Fettucine ala George, a marvelously tasty appetizer as is the lobster bisque. They handle fish selections wonderfully and the tournedos are incredible!\n\nAnytime we are in Vegas we always dine here, don't miss it, it's wonderful, and easily half the price of any other French restaurant in Vegas you might consider."
48088,3,"I am always looking for place to satisfy my bubble tea craving, and was pleasantly surprised to find this little stand.  Most places I've been to have the tea pre-mixed, so I was a little intrigued by all the mixing and blending going on.  My only complaint is that the tea was not cold so it melted the ice quickly.  Also, it was of the jasmine variety, which isn't my cup of tea (literally), but my husband enjoyed it.  Will try it again with a different flavor."
33131,1,"Came into the store to get paint for 5 rooms, so only 10 gallons, small order for them, but big for me. One guy working with a customer. 4 more customers came in and the sales guys emerged from the back to assist and jumped on them. I stood at the color wall staring at the sales man as he avoided eye contact with me.  I even verbalized the lack off assistance and was ignored. Watched the guy walk in back after actually making eye contact. Horrible service. Maybe they should stick to contractors and stop pretending they like to help the general public. Sales associate that finally did assist was brand new and was helpful and charming. When the new guy is out servicing the veterans something in the business model has failed."
37731,1,"On the spectrum of burgers, these are definitely pretty good. It's way better than a McDonald's or Burger King. However, I Love Burgers wouldn't want you to compare their experience to fast food, so I won't, either.\n\nWhen comparing I Love Burgers to other gourmet burger joints, it falls short.\n\nLet's start with the service. There was a small wait to get a table, even though there were tons of open seats. Granted, it was busy, but since the wait time for the actual food was around 45 minutes, wouldn't it have made sense to let us sit? Furthermore, even though we ordered fries, the waiter didn't even think to bring those out first -- we had to ask him. A simple thing like this would've made the time go by a lot easier.\n\nOnto the food... like I said, the burgers are decent, but nothing special. I had the \""i love bacon burger,\"" which comes with a patty made up of sirloin and applewood-smoked bacon, toped with crispy bacon, bacon mayo, gouda, and onion strings. Given how ravished I was at this point, I was happy to eat it, but I don't think I'll ever need to try this place again."
26966,0,"This restaurant consistently lacks any type of service whatsoever. I did not realize picking up an order for my friend can create confusion with the staff. Whoever took the order did not even place the order. Instead of telling me to patiently wait and that they will rush the order, they just looked at each other confused and pretended I was not there. I told one of the server to \""forget it.\"" Instead of stopping me, perhaps offering a drink while I wait for them to rush the order, they just let me walk out. I guess business is not needed in this town that you would not do anything when a customer walks out unsatisfied."
25250,1,"Il y a de ces places, comme Sushi Chef, o\u00f9 l'amour de la table semble un concept oubli\u00e9. Ce comptoir \u00e0 Sushi de la rue Sherbrooke-Est en est un bien triste exemple.  \n\nLe personnel antipathique vous servira sans sourire ni politesse, une assiste de sushi au riz froid. Oui, le service est rapide (premi\u00e8re \u00e9toile) mais les sushis sont n\u00e9glig\u00e9s. J'aurais volontiers attendu 5 minutes de plus pour avoir droit \u00e0 une meilleure assiette. Je n'arrive pas \u00e0 comprendre comment un endroit sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9paration de ce mets japonais peut arriver \u00e0 servir du riz froid comme s'il sortait directement du frigo.\n\nL'ambiance du resto est aussi triste que la nourriture qui y est servie. Une TV joue dans le coin. Des exemplaires du Journal de Montr\u00e9al trainent ici et l\u00e0 sur les tables. Pas de musique. Aucune d\u00e9coration. Peu de clients (surprise ?). Seul autre point positif, l'endroit est propre et tranquille (deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9toile). Pour le reste, Sushi Chef est un resto \u00e0 oublier. \n\nUn dernier conseil : Vous \u00eates dans le coin et d\u00e9sirez manger des sushis ? Traversez la rue et rendez-vous quelques adresse plus loin chez Genki Sushi. L\u00e0, au moins, le personnel est souriant et le riz est tendre."
7419,4,"My wife and I had a carryout order of orange beef and general's chicken with white rice. All were good and fresh. The chicken was thick and juicy, not thin and tough slathered with sauce to cover the poor quality of the meat. The sauces were very good. Polite service over the phone and in person."
2851,1,"Ive heard tons of great things about this place. I decided to get the #1 Two Chicken Enchiladas with beans and rice and it was bleeeeeeegh. I got a spoonful of so-so rice, beans that tasted like they had just come from a can and the enchiladas were even worse. \n\nNormally I dont give places second chances, but the service was good, and the place was very clean. I might try the chorizo or the carne asada next time. Definitely will avoid the enchiladas."
6316,3,"One of my favorite lunch spots in the city.  \n\nI've heard other say \""stay away from the sushi,\"" so, I have, however, their hibachi is delicious and incredibly inexpensive for the quantity & quality of food you receive.  ~$8 for a small basic salad (nothing special), cup of soup (ok), and a GIANT platter of hibachi meat, veggies and rice.  Really really good.  Never too crowded in my experiences during normal lunch hours.  Staff are pleasant but not overly talkative.\n\nAnother reviewer gave parking 2 stars.  Not sure why - I've never had any problem with parking a few spots away from the front door.\n\n2 things bother me, but neither enough to get me to not come back once a month:  1)  It's an old gutted Pizza Hut that is long overdue for a re-haul of the interior.  2) It's on Independence.  Making a U-Turn on Independence, at least in certain stretches, is nearly impossible for miles on end.  Just not very easy for me to get to regularly."
48220,2,"I really like this gym really solid. Good machines, pretty clean (although it's declined recently). The reason they didn't get a five star is because I fell off a treadmill, no biggie I have a knee and ankle injury and sometimes it just buckles. I understand they have to do paperwork for it, but the two ladies at the front asked me really loudly in the middle of the elliptical section 30 minutes after I fell if I needed 911. I told them I was fine and if I can do it later. I mean they waited a half hour. Another 10 minutes would not have mattered. They made me feel like I did something wrong and have to go to the principal's office. No one noticed that I fell until they basically were screaming it out in the middle of the gym. They said they couldn't do the report at that time because they were busy, but considering what happened I think they could've stopped what they were doing if they thought it was urgent. It kind of added insult on to injury, no I take that back it literally did."
40696,2,"The beer is average, but overpriced.  Save yourself $10 on a case and wait until Costco restocks.  ($30 a case at the brewery, $20 at Costco).

We had no idea that we would be the only people between the ages of 21 and 60 in the hotel/casino.\n\nWe had an absolute blast here! They do have live music and the band was great.  We ordered some bar food - potato skins and chicken fingers - and they were just a greasy and delicious as I hoped.  \n\nAnd to my surprise, they make awesome cocktails.

34279,3,"Came in for Happy Hour because of 50% savings on fresh oysters, beer (draft & bottled)-domestic & imported and snacks. PUB extends Happy Hour prices to table seating in addition to cozying up to the bar(which always seems \""packed in like sardines\""). Everyone is so friendly and service was fast. We felt like we were somewhere in England surrounded by white tiles like the underground trains. Yet, you knew this is just transplanted decor as hard rock bleared, adding to gastropub ambience.\n\nAfter slurping down oysters and beers, we ordered pub sandwiches. You have a choice of 1/2 pound or 1 pound portions. 1/2 pound was plenty enough! The pastrami was not your typical deli-style thin cut slices but was served as tender chunks with your choice of fresh baked bread and 2 sauces. Gosh, I couldn't resist truffle mayo to accompany my sandwich. Meanwhile, my husband chose the 1/2 pound crispy duck legs (you get 2 legs & thighs). He shredded/pulled the duck meat off the bones and filled the bread. He also chose the truffle mayo, although the maple soy glaze would have worked well with the duck. Yummo!\n\nIn the end, we stayed for 2 rounds of beer & were filled with our delicious selections. I'm so full, I need to lie down!  We'd gladly return to PUB during our stay in LV but, we're running out of time and want to hit the casinos."
46490,3,"This park is great, don't know why the negative reviews. We spent 5+ hours here today and my daughter did not want to leave. Bought the season passes since it's not that much more than one time admissions and we can come as often as we like. My daughter would  come everyday if it was up to her lol.  The park is not too big and we like it that way because wherever you sit, you are not too far from anything. The only thing that we had a problem with was with the teenagers working in the food outlet, they were just not working fast and did not really know what to do (need more training).\nMust wear water shoes and lots of suntan lotion (or you will definitely get sunburned). The park was really fun, will be going back at least once a week.\nGo early to get good seating with shades. Have Fun!"
13271,1,"Went over to Arpa for dinner last night. I have had tapas before, and although the plates are small, they usually pack a nice flavor and you leave feeling not stuffed, but satisfied. The food was not bad, but we left feeling pretty hungry still. To start we ordered the goat cheese balls in the truffle honey, which were very good, but there were literally only 2 and they were sooooo small! Definitely felt ripped off here. We also ordered the roasted eggplant dip with pita and that was pretty good. We then ordered the salmon, sea bass and a side of asparagus, heeding the waitresses warning about how small the servings were. We couldn't really taste the asparagus because they were pretty burnt, and the salmon came out pretty raw (I ordered it medium). The seabass seemed okay. I would probably go back here for drinks because the bar area looked pretty cool, and in the outside area where we ate they had couches and it was a cool lounge area. I liked the decor and general feel of the place and our server was super friendly and attentive. But I definitely would not order the sangria again, tasted kind of funky and lacked flavor, and the strawberry inside looked kind of scary."
29158,1,"We had lunch here on a Monday. The place was not busy at all. The food was far from spectacular. We used points from the players card to pay for our buffet. Thank goodness because the  food was horrendous. I would never pay for this buffet with my own money. The service was great other than that this buffet just like the establishment its built-in,is on a downward spiral into.the toilet."
29369,1,"I was excited to try this place since I heard so much rave reviews during my visit in NY.  I was disappointed.....!!\n\nWe went on a Tuesday @ 1:00pm and we had a flight to catch at 3:30.  There was no line and the service was quick.  We ordered chicken wings, ABC burger, and strawberry sundae.  THe portions were huge, but everything tasted very mediocre... For the quality of the food, I think it is overpriced!\n\nI think out of everything... I only enjoyed the sweet potato fries.... :("
41227,4,"The barbecue here is amazing, I'm from Texas too.  A few must tries on the sides are the mac and cheese, corn succotash, greens, and grit fries. Don't forget to try the bread pudding. Staff was extremely friendly. I will make sure to make this place one of my pit stops on all my Vegas trips."
11938,3,"I was walking around with a friend of mine after buying drinks at another place. We weren't really craving anything in particular, but this place was packed and it looked like a good idea to check it out. I like the idea of the place, you can basically customize your burger as you like it all the way down to the type of fries/sides that you want. \n\nIf you want to avoid the wait, you can opt to sit at the bar (which is what we did). There was a flirtatious bartender serving us. She was totally flirting with two hefty guys in their 40s. They SO wanted her, it was hilarious watching them drool over her. She wore a tight tank top that showed off her tattoo on the small of her back, total bait for the guys. \n\nService for the food is pretty quick as are the drinks. The bartenders are pretty knowledgeable with the drinks too so they can answer your questions if you have any. You can also get a sample if you would like, which is nice. And if you want to flirt, there are plenty of bartenders to flirt with. TVs are also behind the bar, offering various sporting events. \n\nSo overall, it's a pretty chill place to go to. Fairly cheap food and burgers the way you want it. Worth trying out and fun can be had by all!"
40338,0,"The manager, or owner, of this establishment is horrible. Constantly closes earlier than advertised store hours and will sit and watch while you eat if he is ready to go. I mean within the 12 minutes of him closing at 2! 10 people tried to come in and he just ignored them. I mean seriously. Its Saturday and you close at 2! I don't get his business sense he is still paying the rent for the rest of the day, and I'm sure the people who were ignored will not be coming back and neither will I. I like corner bakery as a brand, but I hope this one goes under!"
21907,3,First time visitor.  Food was very good.  Service was very slow.
5452,2,"My husband and I go to this place mostly for the monday special which is a half chicken dinner now priced at 7.49.   When it was 5.99 years ago, half of Sun City were lining up out the doors.   Now I guess the place is just not as packed. \n\nWe decided to have a BURGER instead of the chicken.   However, they have TWO parts to the burger section on the menu.   One is a Make your own additions to the burger each 50 cents for $5.99 and another section below for different prices which come from 7.99 and up.   These have certain items such as bacon, bleu cheese, jaleponos etc.      I just wanted a burger, medium rare with cheddar cheese and my husband just wanted it plain.   We asked what does it come with and it has a choice of steak fries, potato salad, coleslaw etc.      I failed to ask what also comes on the burger. \n\nWhen we got the burgers, I looked for the cheese and found a small melted quarter size spot on the burger, lettuce and two slices of tomato and a pickle on the side. \n\nThe burger was slightly pink, I like it rarer, and was very thin although it was supposed to be 1/2 pound.   It was also VERY dry tasting.    \n\nWhen we got the bill I asked the server, what happened to the cheese? She said she ordered it with cheese, but I couldn't even see 2 cents worth.    Then we saw we were charged 7.99 and 8.50.     She said because it came with lettuce and tomato, we were charged extra.   What a rip off!   Burger bun just okay.  will NEVER order a burger there again!"
37481,1,This place has an alright vibe although if you are searching for a restaurant with amazing food look elsewhere. The beer is exclusively from Capital brewery in Middleton WI. If you think their beer is interesting and good you will like this bar. I happen to think their beer is boring and uninspired. I would say this place is worth checking out but not a return destination.
39338,1,"I have been interested in visiting this shop ever since I moved into Harrisburg.  I had heard nothing but good things about it, and it seemed to be in a good location, so I stopped in this evening.  I got some doughnuts and a cupcake.  I was surprised at the service, the first three items I requested had run out... and when I asked for a paper menu to take home, I was told that it could be found online (however, it cannot, the website doesn't work.)  Didn't seem like the associate was interested in helping me, but moreover getting me out the door. \n\nThe doughnut was nothing special, could have found a better and cheaper alternative at the supermarket.  The cupcake was dry, the frosting was hard and had a strange taste to it.  \n\nNot impressed overall, I wish this would have been a better experience, it would be great to have a nice bakery in town."
13881,1,The Good: \nGo-Go dancers are hot \nDecorations \nEffects \n\nThe Bad: \nThey are not interested in making sure you come again (very expensive and unfriendly) \nThe DJs reminded me of my friends with ADD. They couldn't stay on a song for more than 30seconds. \nThere is no where to escape to unless you are VIP. It would be nice to have an outdoor area open to everyone. \nToo crowded to dance.\n\nI WOULD NOT come here again
23298,0,"They added too much to their menu, and they're overwhelmed. They also got rid of their good lunch specials. So, go here for the drinks and the atmosphere.\n\nHopefully the management is only doing this temporarily. Because I miss their $5 lunch specials. They're not so popular yet as to scrape those, add a dozen items to the menu, and call it quits. Their kitchen can't handle it.\n\nSo, eat beforehand and come up. The drinks are still good, until they raise the prices of those too.\n\nEdit: Spoke too soon. I just went to their website and noticed they changed their \""$3 Smithwicks Every day All Day\"" to the far inferior Carlsberg for $3 whatever, whatever. Oh, it's sad to see such potential beginning to tank so soon. Service has dropped, quality of food has dropped, and now they really are already raising their drink prices. Shame."
23993,3,"Yea this is definitely a 4.5. I'd give it a 5 but I haven't rated a \""best\""yet. Simply the most unique sushi I've had including Koi.

I didn't but had lava cake and chocolate cup. Everyone voted cup the best. One of my top five Restraunts in Vegas. Back to LA"
10530,4,Puck again hits a home run!  We have gone to several of his restaurants and have not been disappointed yet. \n\nWe had brunch-the omelet was delicious as were the pancakes.

After 30 min the server comes by and says they are still woking on it.  15 min latter we walked out with nothing.  This was the  only time we talked to the server and the Manager never came over, even though he could see us seating there bored to death, to explain why they are inept.  \nHad more conversation with the bus boy as he pickup around us.

6138,2,"On a mission to find the wife bagels and this was the closest place around. Well the service was a bit slow but it was to be expected on a holiday saturday around 10am. One of their employees was a bit slow making bagels too but it seemed like he was new. \n\nAnyway we ordered three bagels with cream cheese and a Naked fruit drink and a small coffee, total was $14 dollars, ouch. Wasn't expecting that but maybe the bagels would be amazing...\n\nAh no, the bagels were ok. I've had better ones at Panera or Grinds & Glazes in Blairsville, GA. They were just decent bagels, and the toasting wasn't long enough. I prefer a light char on my bagels and Brueggers just does a light toast. The coffee was good but I probably won't be back just based on the price:food ratio. They do have 'last nights' bagels in a bin just infront of the register that would be a way better deal than what I ordered. I didn't notice it until I was sitting down, oh well. Maybe you can snag those up if your there."
8837,3,It's a dive but I swear this is the best grilled chicken sandwich I have ever had.  We used to come here a couple times of week when I was in college.  The BBQ sauce is to die for.  And it is so cheap.

The quad also offers free self parking, which isn't too far away.\n\nIsn't the nicest place in vegas, but it's a decent home style diner type place. \n\nHuuuuge portions, very hearty food. Expect to leave feeling a little groggy. Prices are reasonable. Open 24 hours which is nice. \n\nChicken and waffles are good: it's not as deep fried as most fried chicken, but is lightly breaded, flavored with sage, and crumbles off when you cut it. Yum. The mashed potatoes with cheese and bacon mixed into it is food too."
17320,4,"I got back over to Restaurant 28 today for lunch, and I am soooo glad I did.\n\nGeorge (the owner) was there when I arrived and I announced that I was interested in trying his Carolina Style BBQ that I have been hearing so much about.\n\nRestaurant 28 has been given rave reviews from local critics such as Howard Seftel of the Arizona Republic,  Nikki Buchanan from Channel 3's Good Morning Arizona, and the New Times \""Best of Phoenix\"" review.\n\nGeorge was telling me that he has talked to folks who have driven far and wide (Vegas was mentioned) once they heard that there was authentic Carolina Style Q to be had in the Phoenix area.\n\nGeorge credits the positive reviews as a blessing from God, but I would say the true blessing he has received is his unbelievable talent making delicious, down home soul food, and his easy going, pleasant character. It's obvious he takes pride in what he creates, and he talks about it with passion.\n\nTaking his advice, I ordered the Chopped BBQ Pork, Carolina Style, with Hush Puppies and Cole Slaw.  Kool-aid sounded good, so I got that as well. \n\nI can't say as I've ever had Carolina Q, so I have nothing to base it on, but I can tell you if BBQ tastes this good in the state of North Carolina, then there are some lucky folks living there!  \n\nI was raised on KC style Q and have had my share of Texas-style, but George's Pork Butt was \""knock your socks off\"" good!  I have had hushpuppies before, but these were hot and fresh, crispy on the outside and moist and tasty on the inside.  the cole slaw was creamy and delicious as well.\n\nWe got to talking about other specialties of the house and before I knew it, I had also tried a sample of some fantastic fried Catfish, excellent chopped Beef BBQ (Willie's specialty) and some unbelievably tasty collard greens, (something I've never had before, but will order next time with some fried okra.) \n\nGeorge also talked about his past and how he and his wife came to own and name the place.  I'll save that story for him to tell you when you come in.  It's a story worth hearing. \n\n\nI didn't have room for dessert...  :- (  but the menu looked excellent!  Maybe next time.\n\nBY the way, George smokes his butts over hickory, (no gas) and his chitterlings are served boiled, but he will fry them if requested.\n\nHe does normally serve his Q with tomatoey western Carolina Sauce, (also in a bottle on the table) cuz that's what most people are used to around here, but be sure to get it with the tangy, vinegary Eastern style, I tried it both ways, traditional Eastern is the best!

42222,1,"For those of you not familiar with the area, this plaza is usually dead quiet and has very little traffic. The busiest sections of the plaza are Walmart on one corner and the Rubio's/Saba's/Starbucks strip on the very opposite corner. Ritz is located just across from this fairly busy strip so it seems like it's worth a try. I had a craving for sushi so the hubby and I decided to give this place a try since it just recently opened. \n\nI wanted to love this place, I really did. We arrived yesterday evening (Sunday) at about 5:30pm and the place was eerily empty. There was one other couple sitting in a booth when we arrived and servers standing around talking to one another b/c well, they didn't really have much to do. What makes it worse is that the layout of the place makes it feel even MORE empty since everything seems to be spaced out in a weird way. Maybe when all the tables are full this is a trait that one can appreciate but when empty it just looks a little sad. \n\nI ordered a spicy tuna roll, a salmon nigiri and a masago. I don't think the sushi was bad, per se, but I've definitely had better. The construction of the sushi just didn't look authentic and the texture of the spicy tuna was just not what I'm used to. The one good thing I can point out is that their sushi rice is sweet and sticky just like it's supposed to be. My husband also ordered a philly roll and wasn't really impressed. The salmon got lost amongst the larger servings of cream cheese which, hey, if you're a cream cheese fiend then it may be right up your alley.\n\nAside from the sushi, my husband got an order of pad thai and we were both really disappointed. It doesn't taste bad at all but it seriously lacked flavor and was a bit on the dry side. Again, as was the case with the sushi, it just seemed to lack something in authenticity and flavor that we immediately took notice of.\n\nThe service was not bad although it was a bit slow considering there wasn't much for the servers to do at that time. There are a lot of other menu options that perhaps are more impressive. Unfortunately, we probably won't be going back to test that theory out. In our opinion the food was barely decent and the prices are just OK. This place has lived up to our experience with most Asian fusion restaurants trying to serve Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese and every other Asian cuisine under the sun all under one roof....it just doesn't work. With so many unique flavors and styles it's likely that you're not going to specialize in any of them and more likely that all of them will be under par. \n\nBut I'm not a mean person so I do want to point out that this place is brand new and may just be ironing out the wrinkles so to speak. I'd be open to coming back if we hear that reviews are becoming more positive than not or if neighbors/friends have different experiences. SO, if you happen to give this place a try...let me know what you think."
26579,0,"FUGGEDABOUTIT! If this is how food tastes in Italy then Arthur Avenue in the Bronx will be my Italian vacation destination. Nothing was really very good except the potatoes. I must admit that the Pellegrino water was perfectly chilled and we drank 2 bottles. So here is the laundry list:\n\n1) Odd smell when we walked in.\n2) Bread, OK but butter in little Coffee Shop plastic tubs. ( I know but...)\n3) Server was fast and attentive, however, his wine recommendation was not one I would have made if I wanted to increase my tip.\n4) Wine, barely OK\n5) Arancini, not hot, overcooked rice, and not much flavor\n6) Zuppa di Cozze e Vongole, pretty good broth and clams, mussels had a bad texture and were obviously frozen.\n7) Eggplant Parmigiana, Not good at all, hardly any eggplant or eggplant flavor. Tasted mostly of soggy toasted breadcrumbs.\n8) Veal Saltimbocca, barely OK, veal was tough and I did not detect any fresh sage in the dish. Sauce and overall preparation was barely OK.\n9) Roasted Potatoes, this was by far the best dish we had, pretty damn good but these are not on the menu and not always available.\n10) Tiramisu, Tasty but a little strange, no espresso or rum flavor. Seemed to have used Limoncello instead to dip the Ladyfingers.\n11) Mini Cannolis, inedible, so cute but flavored with banana extract and Amaretto.\nTasted like Bubble gum and not very good Bubble gum. Taken off the check.\n12) Double Espresso, quite acceptable.\n\nI had high hopes about Gina's Bistro, the Yelp reviews were mostly positive and a coworker from Italy recommended it highly. He has already been taken off my reliable list. Bottom line, I spent $142 for a seriously flawed meal for 2. Parma Deli would have been a much better choice, even Mezzo which has dropped so much in quality is preferable to Gina's. Way too many problems to have just been an off night. I will never return and can only recommend to stay away."
22214,2,Tequila tasting can we taste some tequila next time.. was a fun experience but the tequila wasn't even a half a shot
23301,0,"Had a Reuben. Not a Reuben. Cole slaw instead of sauerkraut. Very little thousand island dressing. Marble bread, not a strong rye flavor. Corned beef was bland too. Very, very, bland. I'm from Omaha, NE., born and raised, where the Reuben was invented. I'm also Irish. This is more of what's called a Rachel Reuben, except it sticks with the slightly corned beef instead of pastrami or turkey. A Reuben should have a sour and tang, stink a bit. Disappointed. Why they ruined such a beautiful creation is beyond me."

46636,3,"I was actually trying to go to postinos- my AZ friends won't stop talking about it. I accidentally walked into joyride instead, So glad i did!!! Everything I had was insanely good. I love the funk decor, great music, very friendly (and good looking) staff. Service was quick! There's outdoor and indoor seating- it's comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. The food was yum. Yum YUM!! I had 3 tacos- braised beef, Tinga, and pork. First off all it's awesome that they even have Tinga on their menu. But the fact that it was good?! I'm grateful for being so tired after work to make this restaurant mistake. Oh!!! They serve aguas frescas too- they're take on them anyway. I had a cucumber one and I wish I had that recipe. I only wish I lived locally so I can return over abc over again."
20551,0,"Don't come here until they figure out their new menu. We ordered a couple items off the new skinny menu and supposedly they are now cooking their thousands of menu items on the broiler. Maybe they are \""skinny\"" items because you will starve, it was an hour and a half till we got our food and all the manager could offer was 2 free cheesecakes (half of a normal portion) in return for a black and blue steak (which I sent back-it was ordered medium), cold fries, cold chicken tacos, cold burger with un-melted cheese, etc. It wasn't our waiters fault he did everything he could to deal with it and we tipped him accordingly. We ended up fighting our $150 bill and got our entrees removed since we ordered 3 rounds of drinks and there was something wrong with all of the entrees, the bill was still over $90. For tonight's performance, i would give no stars if I could."

22479,1,"So disappointing. I've eaten here so many times and had nothin but rave reviews; that was before I became a Yelper. :)\n\nServer must have been having a bad night because she set the whole time which was basically not good. I want to say how good the food was (appetizer was the fried shrimp and I love it every time) but I don't want to take focus away from how bad the service was. Dang it! I was going I take a picture of the stack of appetizer, salad, and side plates at the end of our table cause they were there for sinking and when I finally decided to whip out the camera she cleared them. Must have seen me typing. Lol. Refills were non existent, server forgot Jen's beer she ordered after being seated and finally brought it after my second refill on soda and after Jen asked for a different beer. She was apologetic and I'm the last person to be mean or belittle a server unless they are outright rude. Our server wasn't rude; just having a bad night i guess. The table next to is were being jerks so maybe it's all their fault. Lol\n\nOur food came and I ate so now I can talk about the food. Aaaaarrgh! No that wasn't a pirate roar. It was the sound of frustration. I really do love this place. And I was sooooo determined tom order something different than the New Orleans chicken which I can't seem to tear myself away from. Tonight, I was a pioneer; a trend setter; Capt. Kirk. In orders their marinated steak cooked mid rare. Mmmmmmm. Well ironworks have been of it wasn't over cooked and completely bland and flavorless. If that hunk of meat had been marinated for 24 hours like the menu states, it must have been in a bucket of water.  Booooo. See what happens when you try new things!  Jen order ribs and some \""burnt ends\"" bbq'd meat combo. They were good. That's all I can say. I didn't even ask for a box for mine. \n\nAlso, I'm all for a nice AC environment during the AZ summer but holy smokes, I couldn't find a knife so I cut my steak with my nipples. Good thing I wore long sleeves or I would have had I amputate due to frostbite. \n\nOk so in closing. Jen is quoted as saying, \""I loved my food.\"" Everything else sucked. I have never had a bad experience here before I'm over a half dozen visits in the last couple years. That makes this so much harder because I think my feelings got hurt. I have bragged about this place to so many I should be getting kick backs. Don't these people know who I am. Geesh!  Lol. I'm sure I will be back but I won't be so eager to do so anytime soon.  I'm sad now. :(\n\nP.S.  Quit taking my silverware and leaving me nothing to eat with. Also, the Mac and cheese was bland and was really bad.  There is virtually no cell service and absolutely no wi-fi. So frustrating. Ok I'm done."
22411,3,"Stayed at the Signature this past weekend so we went to Delights for a post night of drinking meal, and it was good. \n\nI got the Las Vegas Blvd sandwich ( I think that's the one I got) it was a sandwich with Skirt steak, fried egg, caramelized onions, and a sauce. It was so good, my only real complaint is the proportions are kind of small and it's a bit pricey. \n\nI paid $12 for a sandwich but it was a really good sandwich so no real complaints."
30927,2,"Its selection needs improving, but it's the only bookstore at Town Square so you have to make do.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this Borders is new, clean and usually very lively.  But if you're looking for a bookstore with a greater selection, try the Barnes & Noble on Stephanie near the galleria mall.\n\nWhen it comes to bookstores in Las Vegas, your choices are almost strictly limited to Borders or Barnes & Noble.  With all the suburban sprawl, new clean looking chain stores rule.  This is far from a quaint college town with smaller, independent bookstores... so you'll have to accept it for what it is.  This Borders opened up within the past year or two.  It regular has visits and signings by authors, some of them more famous than others.  A few pluses would be plenty of search stations to find books you want.  Another is that there is a Seattle's Best Coffee Cafe inside the store.  Also, there are frequent book drives to help out local schools and community organizations to help get kids reading.  How can you possibly say no to that upon checkout?!\n\nBut the thing that only gets this place 3 stars is the limited selection.  Especially when it comes to the two shelf film section.  Oh but if you're into the \""young adult teen vampire obsession\"" genre, there's plenty of that.  So yeah, if you're looking for something well known and relatively new this place will do.  If you're into something a little more obscure, or just want to browse, maybe not."
39662,1,The Gag Us Grill ......I gagged from the bamboo shoots and had to pick them all out because they tasted like tin from the tin can they came from so my bowl all tasted canned also the sauces I picked were too sweet.\n\nI also don't think it is right that they charge you a dollar more at dinner time just because it is dinner time. (I asked the server if it is any different at lunch and she said no)\n\nThis stir fry place cost more than the independently owned one across the street .
40694,2,"I don't mean to be a grumpy reviewer here amongst obviously a sea of 5 star reviews. And I am going to be very honest up front that the person who took my order was EXTREMELY friendly and nice, she even gave me advice between he two items I was choosing to order.\n\nHow it works here is that they take your order in front of the truck, then the order is handed to one of the personnel inside the truck and they call your name when your item is ready.\n\nI picked Herben Legend to be the first food truck to sample because it seemed like it had the shortest line amongst entree serving trucks. Therefore, I think my review is quite fair since I did not have any other trucks to compare the food to. I was gravitated towards this truck as well because of the eclectic ethnic choices on the menu board. American, Vietnamese, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Mexican! \n\nI ordered the Mojo beef tostada and I was not impressed. I was not the only person who sampled the item, my cousin also had some of my food. Neither one of us liked it very much. After I lifted up my fried tortilla bowl like chip, there was an inch of red grease on the bottom of the paper plate...I also thought the presentation of the food could have been a bit well thought out, it was hard figuring out how to eat it. A pile of pulled beef with lemon zest and avocado piled on top of a big tortilla chip. The flavor was a bit too greasy and sour for my taste. \n\nI will definitely give Herben Legend another try, it could be that I just ordered the wrong item or I caught them on a busy day. The fried green tomato provolone sandwich(the other item I was choosing to order) sounded extremely tempting!"
47536,4,"We are in from Texas and happened upon WhereUBean and were pleasantly surprised. Great little coffee shop! Clean, comfy, and nice staff!!! The coffee is very good, according to my very picky friend and their new chai tea is delicious!!! If we're ever in Phoenix again, we will definitely visit again!!!"
15822,2,"Ilios Noche is a difficult place to classify.  We met a few friends there, and are glad that we went early, because even with a relatively small group (5), we barely fit on a weeknight.  This place gets packed.  Consider yourself warned.\n\nAs we had heard good things about the spreads, we tried some, and they were tasty indeed.  The Htipiti (no idea if I spelled that right) was our favorite, and I probably could have eaten it all night.\n\nThe staff - or at least our waiter - was awesome.  He helped us with the menu, gave us tips on the wine list, even brought out samples (hefty samples at that) when people couldn't decide, big thumbs up on service, something that you don't always find.\n\nAt the end of the meal, he even took me in the kitchen to show me the desserts because I couldn't decide which one I wanted.  Pretty cool.  Remember to tip your server.\n\nThe only thing that was somewhat disappointing was the main course.  That's not to say that everything is disappointing, or even that mine was, just that dessert was tasty (some sort of chocolate torte thing, but it was less cake-like than I would have expected) and the appetizer was awesome, the service was great, and the sandwich was pretty good.  The ends are great and the middle was, well middling.\n\nBy itself, it probably would have been quite good.  With everything else, so-so."
11028,1,"Gluten free and whatever, typical over priced Las Vegas restaurant with subpar food. One dish was so bad we had to send it back and the menu outside the restaurant wasn't even the current menu. I try to order things that are naturally gluten free in a normal manner without asking if it's gluten free. I have severe gluten allergies that make me deathly ill and I didn't have any issues eating here other than the food not bring that great."
38261,0,"I came here last week to try out the huevos rancheros that my dad and sister claimed to love. I had been to New Mexico Grill once before for an ok bean burrito so I figured the huevos rancheros would be a safe bet.\n\nMuch to my dismay, neither the red or green sauce was vegetarian. My only other options were a quesadilla or bean burrito so I went with another burrito. Again, it was ok. I used lots of the thin, red salsa to add some spice. I was very disappointed with their salsa verde though. Normally I prefer it to red, but theirs was so bland.\n\nTo my father's dismay, the rice wasn't ready yet so he couldn't sub the potatoes with it like he usually does. I don't blame him since the breakfast potatoes are just disgusting. I'd bet dollars to donuts that the flavorless cubes come straight from a freezer bag. I'm not sure why the rice wasn't ready yet just like I couldn't understand why they didn't have chips out either. \n\nWhat really angered me about this place is how I was treated when I asked for corn tortillas for my husband's chorizo scramble. My husband is newly gluten intolerant, and he forgot to ask for corn tortillas instead of flour (maybe it would have been helpful if the cashier asked). When I asked for the corn tortillas, the cashier wanted to charge me $2.59 for three small tortillas! It's ridiculous for two reasons: 1. I'm sure they buy them from Food City for $1/dozen like I do. They definitely aren't made in house. 2. Why can't they show a little customer courtesy by happily giving us a substitution? Instead, the manager demanded that I bring him back the unused flour ones before he would replace them. Why? Was he planning on serving them to someone else?\n\nAfter this terrible treatment, I won't be the least bit sorry if this place goes out of business. They must be having financial troubles if they are cutting this many corners."
43372,0,*Bad service.\n*Food is awful.\n\nWings are overgrown thunder hormone injected wings. Wing flavors are not good. \nMini tacos were worst than Taco Bell. Not only they were awful but we found a blonde hair in our food and manager apologize to offer something on the menu. But at this point we didn't want to eat anything at this restaurant even if its free. My bill came out to 60.00. I love wings but it was so awful I didn't even want to take it home.
1047,0,"I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \""I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\"" template.\n \n Majerle's is one of those experiences.\n\nI know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.\n When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.\n \n   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. \n  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. \nNot so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.\nDownright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.\n If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not."
28439,0,"Terrible food.  There was no background music playing in the restaurant once you sat down so you could hear people's conversations from across the room.\n\nMidway through the meal, a random woman from the street came up and asked us for money!!\n\nNo return for us, ever!"
16186,0,"We were looking for some good Italian food, so we decided to visit Tomaso's. The entire experience was unsatisfactory. You have to park in an awkward lot arranged so that you have to turn out and then back in before you find the Valet. Our waiter vacillated between hovering at the hostess station while staring at us to ignoring us completely. The salad turned out to be canned pears atop wilted lettuce with an odd topping of fried onion strings. The pasta was good, but not worth the $20 asking price. The dessert and coffee were served with no spoons, so we were forced to go foraging for extra silverware at a neighboring empty table. Finally, we had to wait at least five minutes at the valet station for the attendant to arrive back from his break. \n\nOn a Saturday night the restaurant was more than half empty, so the waiter really had no excuse. Luckily, his counterpart who was serving the next table over took pity on us and refilled our bread basket and water glasses, offered us fresh ground pepper for our appetizer, and  answered our questions about the dishes our own waiter had abruptly plunked down in front of us before bolting back to the hostess station. \n\nWhile the experience here gave us a lot to laugh about, we will not be returning to Tomaso's."
12450,2,This hotel had it's ups and downs. Checked in late on Friday night and the non-smoking room we requested was given away so we had to settle with a smoking room. They told us to come to the front desk between 12-3pm the following day to change rooms since they gave our room away so we agreed. \n\nNext day rolls around and after a great time at the pool and gym we called and they kept pushing back the time on when the room would be ready. We wasted 5 hours of our day not being able to leave and waiting for our non smoking room to be available. For someone who comes for the weekend and hours are limited it really sucks to waste time. Finally they gave us a non smoking room after complaining for 5 hours and sounding upset. It was a big disappointment. I'm giving three stars because that was an awful experience but the hotel itself wasn't too bad. The room we got upgraded and it was really nice. \n\nOn a positive light the hotel is in the middle of the strip and it's across the street from Cosmo and Bellagio. Had fun shopping and eating at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr place.
32822,1,"As far as I'm concerned, Adam Richman can keep this place. I really was not impressed with hash house, I ordered their bacon, avacado, and swiss scramble along with crispy potatoes and a bisquit. The eggs were really runny and not appetizing, I love eggs and I was severely disappointed by this, the best part of them was the bacon mixed in, but even then it was overpowered by the eggy, soggy mass (needless to say, I didn't finish them) the potatoes were ok, but not memorable, the best part of the breakfast was the biscuit wich was very good, it was light on the inside with a crisp crust and had a hint of rosemary in it, delicious! i didn't need butter or jam with it. The other problem with hash house was the portions, they give you way too much on one trough sized plate, it's intimidating to see when it comes out, it makes you feel that every meal was an eating competition of it's own, no wonder man vs. food went there. Next time Adam Richman says to eat somewhere, do your own investigation and skip this place and go to Bobby Flay's MESA for their awesome brunch."

We received one but not the other and had to fight for the attention of the staff to ask for our second shake, which was definitely not even on the radar of being made.

10305,1,"Slots-A-Fun used to be a fun place.   They benefitted from all the foot traffic that used to be more prevalent on the North Strip.   With the fall of most of their neighbors Slots-A-Fun now primarily serves as a slot parlor for guests at Circus Circus.      No more table games...and thats a shame because it was a fun place to play craps.\n\nI still pop in almost every visit just as a tribute to the old days but its a tomb every  time I go.    Seems like there's less than 10 people in there every time I visit now.  I Cant imagine how they stay in business.    They still have some good cheap eats/drinks at the snack bar...and the gift shop is nice for cheap souveniers....but without any people there is simply no energy in this place.     Maybe with the revival of Sahara and a new casino planned next door Slots-A-Fun will get back to its former glory.   But for now, its just kinda sad."
10444,3,"Happened upon this place while waiting to watch Zumanity @ the NYNY. I was actually pretty surprised by this place. It has a nice atmosphere and really decent prices for an in casino restaurant. The chips and salsa were perfect and the carnitas tacos I had were moist and juicy. Everything served hot and fresh with great ambiance. The beans were pretty tasty, and something most restaurants mess up. If your on this end of the strip its not a bad place to stop before heading to the club."
26476,1,"this place opened and fell right on its face. I haven't had the desire to go back after the lack of taste and their inability to plan seems to be part of their business model. I had the turkey leg, the last one, and it was 6pm. I stood in line for what seemed to be an hour, I'm not sure why they don't have a large menu posted that everyone can read. ok on to my meal, they did get it right, the bad part was the my sides where mac'n cheese and beans, mac seemes like it'd been sitting all arternoon, mushy and slimy. the beans had a very boring flavor like you expect from something from a can. the turkey leg itself was a lot of fat with about 4 oz of meatit had decent flavor, I was just pissed about the size. So unfortunatly south Phoeinx is again without a good take home BBQ place, because while jakes may still be open i'm seeing a \""out of business\"" sign comming unless changes are made."
26874,2,"I don't know if it's the best Carne Asada in town.  But it's darn tasty... flank steak assertively marinated and grilled, with a nice char on the outside.  The char sets good carne asada apart from the rest.  Loved the agua fresca offerings.... I got the jamaica and dining partner ordered tamarindo.  both tangy and refreshing.  however we take major points off for the chips/salsa.  it's a side dish for $1.50, with a fairly good sized basket of chips but a tiny little dribble of salsa.  we got more for another $1.50 and still felt ripped off.  I mean c'mon, kids, you can make gallons of the stuff for a small amount of dinero, you're shamelessly overcharging for it.  We will probably go back to try the Vampiro and the Pastor, but I'd gladly give more than 3 stars if you weren't so parsimonious with salsa, a Mexican restaurant staple."
5214,0,"These people were too stupid to send a bill to the correct address and then after getting the correct address, were too stupid to send me the bill for another FOUR MONTHS. I guess I underestimated how difficult it can be to use a computer to type out a bill and actually mail it out.\n\nAlso, Randy seems to think the best way to have people people pay a bill they've never actually received is to insult them and ask if they're too poor to afford $70. Well, Randy, it's very difficult to pay a bill that you and your client are too incompetant to send out.\n\nFYI, I have yet to receive an actual bill. All I've received is a letter stating the amount due with stickers and stamps on it. Good job. I can see the four months of hard work you put into this."
27314,0,"This place epitomizes the word overrated. \n\nThe food was a bit too \""fusion\"" for my taste. We ordered the scallops, grouper and duck confit, and all were underwhelming. Too many flavors going on, no cohesion. We also ordered the skirt steak tacos. The handmade tortillas were quite good, but the steak tasted smokey, almost like bacon. Nothing like I thought or was described. \n\nOur waitress seemed like she just started working there. Whenever we asked her questions, she answered awkwardly with hesitation. At the end of our meal, she didn't ask us if we liked the food. I'm surprised that she is working in fine dining. Seems like she would be better fit at a sports bar.\n\nMaybe I am spoiled from living in Portland, but, overall, I would not recommend this place."
30155,4,"This is hands down the best \""fine dining\"" thai restaurant that I've ever been to.  It was conveniently located inside our hotel (The Aria) and was priced pretty modestly.\n\nWe started off with their awesome prawn  rolls, shared a chillean seabass, a lobster fried rice(was on their specials menu) and duck penang curry. All of these entrees were amazing and they made them with just the right amount of spicyness.  We asked for a 4/5.... and we were sweating ever so slightly...PERFECT :).\n\nWe ordered every single drink on the cocktail menu, all of which were awesome.  We opted not to get dessert, but our waiter was really nice and bought us a fried banana on the house.\n\nThanks for the lovely experience!"
2953,2,"I am going to be the party-pooper here and say that my visit was only so-so. My brother and I both ordered here and neither of us finished our meals. Maybe... we just weren't that hungry.\n\nWith that said, maybe I just don't know good (real) Asian food when I have it in my mouth? This could be the case... or my brother and I both got bad batches. After all, we did stumble in about 15 minutes before they were closing (which generally doesn't make the cooks happy).\n\nThe owner however was super nice. Actually, absurdly nice. He had a demeanor that had us both walking out going... \""could that guy be any more calm?\"" Seriously though, I've never met someone so peaceful. \n\nSeeing as how we had never been there the owner also whipped out a little picture book with all the stuff they serve. It was nice for us two un-cultered folks.\n\nWith all this said, would I go again? Not really unless I was right there and someone else wanted to go."
26273,3,"Fast food atmosphere - but great food! You order like you're at McDonalds, but when the food comes, it's delicious. You pick up your order when your number is called. Food is served in plastic bowls and plates with plastic utensils (wooden chopsticks though). Prices are high considering the fast food ambiance, but still well worth it.\n\nI started with really good spring rolls. Then when I saw the size of my main course, I thought twice about finishing my appetizer. The duck soup was  piled high with crispy, fatty duck pieces. Underneath was a delicious soup full of egg noodles. I washed it down with a Tsingtao beer. \n\nA confession: when I was done, I didn't bus my table like I would at McDonalds- after all, this is Las Vegas."

2593,2,"I had to purchase a few map books for work and this is the best location in the east valley. The reason I like this place so much is because they usually carry everything I need for our Arizona and Nevada branches. I have been coming here for years now to purchase updated maps for the valley. Each time I need something, they have it and they have it in bulk, which is greatly appreciated. A lot of people guy online now to order or use GPS so map stores are few and far between. I like being able to have a store that is local so I don't have to wait for shipping. It also nice to go through map books in person to see which works best for what I need it for. The staff is always courteous and helpful whenever I have called or gone down to make a purchase. Thanks for always carrying what we need!"
12571,4,"This by far, is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. I stayed here the other day for a few nights and gosh, i can't describe how beautiful this place is. I checked in later in the evening and wanted a non-smoking room. Fortunuately for me, the reservationist did not have anything available in the Venetian tower, so she upgraded me to a suite in the newer, more fabulous Venezia tower. Awesome. It was quite a walk to my suite though and I felt I was like some hamster in a maze while I was looking for my room. But as soon as I opened my door and walked into my suite, my jaw dropped. My suite was huge! Not sure if that's the standard size or not, but it probably can fit 8 people comfortably! And it was just lil' ol' me!! Man, I wished my apartment was that big!"
9096,3,"My brother, friend, and I did a little bit of traveling and while we were in the area, we were craving some Chinese. Seen this place on Yelp and with a 4 star average, it was worth a shot.\n\nWe got there during lunch time so all they had were the lunch specials.  I ended up getting the Sesame Chicken because I've been craving some for a while.  Since it was my first time here, I didn't know they threw in a egg roll and \""a soup of the day\"".  Seeing all that and the prices, I was like \""right on\"".\n\nSo, when the waitress came out with the food, I seen the food pile they had.  The whole plate was pretty full and looked good.  I was thinking to myself \""wow, this is the lunch special?\""\n\nSo first thing I've tasted was the chicken.  The chicken they used remind me of the chicken they use at buffets for the sweet and sour chicken, but more tasty.  The sauce itself was good, but could of been a little more on the sweet side, also more of it.  Just simple little flaws that doesn't make it terrible.\n\nOverall for the price and size of the food, it was a pretty good place.  Don't live near Peoria, so IDK when the next time I will come here, but if I'm around again, I will consider it."
46452,1,"I'm torn because they have such a great bar, but the service is terrible.  How do you not notice customers walking in when your standing right there chatting with friends?  15 minutes before service is why probably why your not earning many tips, just an fyi."
39875,3,"They have a good variety on the menu, from oven wood oven baked pizza's to Osso Bucco.  Try the Mamma meatball slider to start!  Went on a saturday night, it was busy, so i can get noisy."
1187,4,"Having lived in the neighborhood for eight years, I can't say much other than: variety, reliable, authentic. But what I'm really compelled to tell you all about is...\n\nThey now serve Thai! In addition to their already huge menu! \n\nThe Chicken Pad Thai is arguably the best I've ever had (I've had it in New York and San Francisco). Its crazy how good it is... I had to have it two days in a row to confirm. I've had the green curry and that was yummy - fresh veggies in everything, crispy and plentiful.\n\nIMHO, their decor rocks! I love the cheesy waterfall in the front, the chairs with coffee cup designs and giant turntable-centered family-sized tables. The green walls are an upgrade from the pink and blue that was there before. Go to Fate if you want to sit in faux-modern Ikea surroundings.\n\nThis place is classic Mc Do Well"
554,1,"Man, I really want this place to be good... but it's not.  A shame - it's so convenient to get delivery (especially when it snowed, hah).  Quintessential Chinese take-out isn't all that great in the first place, but Cherry House's dishes don't even measure up to that standard.\n\nProbably the most annoying thing about the beef, chicken, or shrimp entrees is the abundance of vegetables.  Don't get me wrong - I love my greens, but there just isn't much in the way of protein.  Having ordered a variety of entrees, each of them just go overkill with the veggies.  You feel cheated - the dishes should be along the lines of \""snow peas, carrots, and a sampling of shrimp.\""  And to make matters worse, despite the diversity of dishes available, there's about three flavor profiles available:  (1) salty; (2) sweet; and (3) sweet and salty. \n\nHot and Sour Soup - They're doing it wrong.  The viscosity is off, and it's neither hot nor sour, really.  \n\nWhen my sister visited and tried this place, she said everything from there tastes like broom handle.  I've never had the pleasure of trying broom handle (and I don't know how she would know...) but I take it that it's no filet.\n\nFor me, the coup de grace was hair in my food the last two times I ordered!  Supremely unpleasant and tossed it out immediately.  You want to believe it was an accident the first time, but when it happens twice in a row... it's no accident.  Something's busted with the people, product, or process.\n\ndmo out."

I had never been to the ER in my life so i went home thinking maybe i was being a baby about the pain.... 2 days later i woke up in the middle of the night in so much pain even worse than before... I told my husband to drive me to the ER and he was like \""Why, they didn't admit you last time?\"" I told him i don't care and to take me NOW.... I get there and they bring me back for another chest Xray and my left lung was almost collapsed... The ER thanked me for coming back so soon....

648,3,"Wow! A treat for your senses for sure! The moment you walk in you are greeted with colorful, beautiful, edible things!! Classical music plays while you walk through the store.\n\nIt is fun to buy a hot drink and walk around the store looking at all the gourmet items. Definitely don't go hungry or plan to eat there. They have boxed sushi, made-to-order sandwiches, hot and cold dishes, etc. \n\nThe candy and cake sections will make you stop in your tracks. The artistic decorating is something to talk about. Definitely fancy and expensive! \n\nThe items are definitely pricey, but it is such a nice experience to see beautiful food! (But I had to laugh because their stock shelves look like the wire shelves you can buy at Walmart...so the next time I looked in my pantry I said, \""Look, I have a little section of Dean and Deluca in my home.\"")"
42548,0,"Yes, there is a \""eat at your own risk\"" type warning for the smoked salmon. I unfortunately developed food poisoning after eating the honey-glazed smoked salmon sandwich last month. I was chained to the porcelain throne from 4 pm to 4 am and had to miss a day of work. It was pretty much a bagel with pieces of smoked salmon and chopped onion/tomato on top of a bagel. No cream cheese was put on it (which would probably help anchor down the ingredients), and the whole thing fell apart on first bite. \n\nThe workers are friendly and the drinks are fine; but I'm never coming back here."
35619,1,"I adore Lee's Sandwiches for their convenience but it's not consistent between different locations.  \nThis location is great because it's relatively close to the strip and it is open 24 hours.  However, the sandwiches, drinks and pastries are much better at the Lee's in California.\nOverall, Lee's Sandwiches is just overpriced Banh Mi's. \n\nreminder: there's a 25 cents additional charge per item after hours"

49372,0,"First and for most. It's awful when a breakfast place has crappy tasting coffee. The food portions are sort of small for the price you pay, and this place is super over rated just because, they have \""cool\"" pancakes. The space is super cramped. Which makes it hard to get around especially when its packed. The tables are also too damn small. Servers are a hot mess and don't know where to start when it's busy. I waited 20mins to pay! If you just sat a 16top maybe you should ask for some help, and see if another server can check on your tables for you! We never got a water refill and couldn't find a retard to fill it for us! Gah I'm still annoyed thinking about my experience. And it was my 2nd time here thinking ok I'll give it another shot and see what the hype was about. And it ended up being 10x worse than my first experience.   Never again! Can I have my 60$ back please!?!"
47502,0,Service is pretty bad and eclair or croissant were not good at all. Very much overrated. We had to ask for silverware and water twice. It wasn't very crowded either. Nothing we had was close to average including the brunch plank. Only above average item was the French toast.
46540,1,"Ordered lunch for the 2nd time.  The first time it was okay - good enough to go back but what a disappointment today.  Greek salad loaded with cheap Feta cheese that was very hard and way over-used.  The lettuce was all Iceburg and mostly the hard white stalks rather than leaves.  Very little flavor to the dressing, could see no oregano and the garlic bread was greasy.  Co-worker was uninspired by the chicken fingers with soggy fries.  They included a free cheese pizza but it was greasy and also uninspired.  The sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce.   We won't be ordering again."
4671,0,"Do NOT go here. The doctors are good enough but the wait time to get in the room is at least 30 minutes each time. Check in: 10:35, appt time: 10:45, time now 11:27.

32933,3,"In the mall at Aria lies a bird house made of wood that serves great steak. We came here with a reservation made on Open Table for a pre-show dinner for a birthday. It's pricey but the steaks are worth it. I read the sides are massive, they were decent. Enough for 2 people in my opinion. I had the bone-in filet and it was delicious. My partner had a grilled fish and it was fresh and tasty. The sauteed spinach was full of garlicky goodness and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. The big bread basket had lots of choices and the chocolate cake was great. The service was impeccable and our waiter was very knowledgable. The only downfall is the location. It's so odd to be at a high-end restaurant in a mall, even if it is a very high-end mall."
1602,1,"Food is good for the most part. The employees could care less if your there however. Stood at the door watching the host and waitress flirt near the bar. Finally gave up and sat ourselves. Still no attention from a server so my wife walked to the counter to order. That finally got someones attention! We got some sodas and ordered our food but to our disappointment multiple people came in, ordered after waiting to be seated and got their food before us. I guess if you seat yourself and put your own order in they no longer consider you a good customer or something because it sure felt like no body cared about our experience. Only way we got a drink refill was to flag down the waitress.  Bad experience service wise but its what we have grown accustomed to at this location. Take my advice and just order delivery."
34873,4,Just went back for lunch and drinks  and I'm not sure what people were talking about with the poor customer service.  Everyone was super nice from the bartender to the wait staff.  Yes it took 30 minutes to get food but they stated that upfront.  Had the family sliders to try out all the different ones.  The brisket and the short rib sliders were the bomb out of the group!!  The mojito's were still kick ass!

36865,2,"First of all, let me say I rarely eat red meat.  I'm more of a chicken/turkey/seafood kind of gal.  This was my third time to Brgr, and I had previously tried the Salmon Burger (just so-so) and the Tree Hugger (lentil & falafel - not too fulfilling). This time, however, I decided to take the plunge and try an actual BURGER.  So I went with the Shrooms burger, topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie cheese and mustard aioli.  I ordered it medium-well, and it was prepared accordingly.\n\nFor me, a person who eats red meat only a couple times per year, the burger wasn't mindblowingly, extraordinarily outstanding.  It was tasty, but I wasn't rocked to my core. The mustard aioli was pretty yummy, though...unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the brie.\n\nMy friend ordered the Double Yoi Burger, which came with pastrami, Swiss cheese, fried egg, cole slaw, and Thousand Island dressing. He moaned and raved his way through the thing - definitely sounds of pleasure and satisfaction. I was happy because it was his first time to Brgr, and he thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nWe also shared an order of the fries (just with the parmesan and herbs), which were pretty standard (but nicely cooked), and a salty caramel milkshake (delish!). \n\nSo....from a culinary perspective, it was pretty good fare, though I have heard Burgatory blows it out of the water...\n\nAs for other factors, my friend and I had a short wait time, and our server was a very personable, patient, attentive 20-something woman who was very pleasant and helpful with our menu questions.  \n\nI would go back to Brgr - it's very convenient to my apartment, and I really want to try the Thai Pork & Shrimp Burger. :)"

40297,1,"This review is for the location on Elliot only.  My husband and I visited and ordered the root beer float (there is alcohol in this) and a Diet Pepsi (seriously, Pepsi?  Get it together and put some Coke on the menu).  Root Beer Float was good, tasted like a root beer float, but managed to look like a glass of dirty milk.  Pepsi tasted like the fountain used water from the toilet.  \n\nDinner!  Yay!  Wait, noooooo.  Husband ordered the Chicken Parm and I ordered the stuffed rigatoni.  Both of these dishes came out with about a cup of fresh parsley sprinkled all over them.  Like the garnish, and literally a whole cup of it.  They also cut the stems up on it, but I'll get to that in a minute.  Lets start with the CHICKEN PARM.  First of all, it was a big breast of chicken, not a formed and processed patty of chicken asslips and beak.  The pasta with it was cooked only to the point of not crunchy.  And after the first bite my husband looked at me and said \""this tastes like they boiled the pasta in dirty water\"".  I have to say, I don't think it was the pasta, I think it is their sauce.  My rigatoni tasted funny.  The ricotta inside was creamy and tasted good, but I couldn't put my finger on what tasted funny.  Then, just as I had figured it out, I felt something hard and crunchy in my mouth. A HARD AND CRUNCHYTHING IN MY RIGATONI?  Did I lose a tooth?  Was it a bug?  Oh, it was just a huge chunk of parsly stem.  There was so much of this crunchy parsley stem in the dish and the taste of the sauce was horrible, I couldn't eat it.  The manager came out (I hate when this happens, I'm not trying to get a free meal, I just don't like the food.  Get over it).  She offered to make us a pizza.  The Chicago Style I saw at the next table looked good, but I was told that takes 40-50 mintues to bake.  SIgh, we got a small cheese and pepperoni thin crust.  \n\nThe pizza came out and it was just cheese.  The server that brought it informed us that the pepperoni was under the cheese.  I ate a piece and again, their sauce tastes like it was made with dirty tomatos from the garden, not good.  My husband choked down a few pieces of this and managed to find a piece of pepperoni under all that cheese.\n\nNeedless to say, I was upset as this location was not even close to the location in Tempe, or Camelback.  We won't go back and urge you to drive the extra 10 minutes eat at another one of their locations."
26950,1,Good healthy eats where everything is organic.  But if eating organic food is not totally up your alley then it may seem a bit more expensive.  I got the tuna sashimi salad which was really to die for.  It was a nice size for me because Im not a heavy eater.  Boyfriend got some steak tacos which were really good but you pay about $15 for only 2 small tacos.

Most of the produce is pretty shabby, I get the feeling that this is the place other Von's stores dump their about to expire goods.  Their prices also suck.  I suspect that's because this is probably the closest grocery store to the strip.  The booze and ice in particular are no bargin.\n\nAnd of course you have all the crack heads and freaks hasseling you in the parking lot, that's always a treat!\n\nSteer Clear Big Tuna, head for open waters!

9837,3,this is a great cheap hotel to stay at when you come to vegas!!  it's a little farther down on the strip but nice nonetheless.  it's also huge!!  my favorite thing about this hotel is the pool!!  they have a huge pool and a waterslide too!!  there are tons of chairs to lay out on and a beautiful waterfall to relax by.. they have tons of slot machines and other casino games to gamble your little heart away!!  i love the old school renaissance look of this castle themed hotel!!  check out thunder from down under for some hot austrailian men or the tournament of kings to root for your team's knight during dinner!!  i would stay here again in a heartbeat!!
21689,1,"Maybe I'm spoiled growing up near all the great wine regions of California but the wine here to me was totally uninspired. The Chardonnay tasted like something out of a box and the sparkling had almost no bubbles. The only wine remotely interesting was the Zinfandel made with Lodi grapes. I was also disappointed they didn't have tasting notes from the wine maker with vintages, grape sources, etc. which is pretty standard at a winery in my experience.\n\nThe space is great, nice location and well thought-out layout. And I bet a bottling party would be fun."

Since I normally do not eat breakfast at Paradise Bakery, I had to hang back and take in the menu. Luckily, the employees were really nice and waited while I decided. After ordering, our food came quickly. I ordered the Asiago breakfast sandwich - bacon, egg, and Vermont white cheddar on a bagel. I subbed for a plan bagel with no hassle. It was relatively inexpensive and filling. I'd order it again if I was ever in the area for breakfast. My husband ordered a slice of coffee crumb cake - it was delicious!

We ordered the vegetable spring rolls with the sweet chili and plum sauces which were pretty tasty\""family style\"" and we were informed that the meals were \""on a plate\"".  We ordered per person according to this info and requested \""medium\"" spicing.  Imagine our total surprise when we are brought 4 large plates of food...enough to feed a small army. Oh well, leftovers for the evening.  \n\nThe real shock was to come when we tasted the food that was too spicy/hot to consume.  When I expressed my concern to the waitress I was informed that \""real Thai food\"" is hotter than \""American Thai food\"". WTH?!!?  I think if that is the case in this particular establishment then patrons should be made aware of this when they are asked, \""How spicy would you like this?\"" When I expressed this to our waitress I was given a blank look.   The waitress said she could take our food  the kitchen to be \""redone\"" and we requested that it be packed to go.  BTW...no adjustment to our bill was offered.\n\nSecond shock of the day was when we decided to have  \""redone\"" leftovers for dinner and we find a strand of long, dark straight hair in our food!!!  \n\nWill we return to Satara? NEVER!!  Will we recommend Satara as a place to visit?  NEVER!  My advice is to read all of the reviews and go at your own risk.  I wish I had checked this place out before spending my time and money on such a disappointing meal.  Unfortunately we left hungry and over spiced."

49545,3,"Best coffee in the area! I had their red velvet latte today and nothing else even compares. Friendly employees and cozy atmosphere inside too! My only complaint is it's a little pricey. I'm also a little surprised they don't have any high chairs, but overall I'm happy to give them my business and I will definitely be back!"
30961,2,"About a year ago I had some Dave's Electric beer in Bisbee.  I thought the beer was just ok.  It was more about the novelty of having a beer brewed and sold only in Bisbee.  After Bisbee though, I never gave Dave's Electric much thought until they opened a brewpub about a mile from my house.  My wife and I are big fans of trying new local breweries and brewpubs so were excited to try it.  We finally made it last Saturday at about 9pm and the place was dead.  There were only about 5 other people in the place which is good because I like to have my choice of seat and don't like to wait for drinks and service.\n\nThe place is pretty big but probably 2/3rds of it is taken up by huge brewing tanks so the actual bar/dining area is pretty small.  We opted to sit outside because they had lots of heaters.  The heater by our table though was on the fritz so the bouncer guy stood there almost the entire time trying to keep the thing lit which was thoughtful.\n\nI really liked the atmosphere of the place.  The bar opens up to a nice patio where you can sit, chat and people watch.  There are several TVs where you can watch whatever games are on.  There was also a small band playing in the corner.  Being right on ASU's campus and having reasonably priced beers it was hard to believe that the place wasn't busier.  I'm guessing that the place will get super crowded before ASU football games so get there early if you want a seat because space is limited.\n\nTheir selection of beer is small.  They only had 4 of their beers on tap which was limiting but also made it easier to decide.  They were all $4 ($3 during happy hour) which I guess is pretty reasonable.  I had the Old Frog Grog and my wife had the IPA.  Their beer isn't my favorite but it is very good.  It is more about trying a new place and supporting a local brewery rather than going for a superb beer.\n\nA couple of the reviews on here mention poor service.  I think that the service was very good.  Our waitress was quick and friendly and I have no complaints.\n\nThey have a pretty large food menu for a brewery but is still pretty typical bar food so I'm not sure how good it is.\n\nWill I rush back?  No; I just didn't think the place was all that special and different from a lot of other bars in AZ.  However, if I am in the immediate area and want a decent beer, then yes I will return."
9559,1,"Ok...I have not used many dry cleaners in my lifetime, being more of a \""t-shirt and jeans\"" kind of girl, but on occassion, I need to get SOMETHING dry cleaned, whether its a skirt, my fella's hat, or a suit jacket that we had borrowed from a friend.\n\nMy first experience with these guys was about a year ago.  My fella had dropped his hat off to be dry cleaned, and asked me to pick it up after work.  He told me that when he had dropped it off, that they promised they would be open til 6:30.\n\nI pulled up at 6:15, opened the door, and walked in. \nRather than being greeted, I hear \""WE'RE CLOSED!!\""\n\nOh no you did NOT just yell at me.  \n\n\""Really?  Your door is unlocked, and I need to pick something up, and was promised that you'd be open til 6:30.\""\n\nThey got the hat, but did so with a very pissed off look and attitude.  \n\nFast forward to 3 days ago.  My fella had borrowed a suit jacket for a movie scene he did some extra work in, and we wanted to dry clean it before returning it.  \n\nSo, I drop it off on my way to work, noting the signage on the windows that say \""Same Day Service!\""\n\nI asked the girl when it would be ready for pickup.  \n\n\""Oh...tomorrow.\""\n\n...ok...but your window says same day.\nIts fine, really, not a huge deal, since we didn't need the jacket same day...but if you're going to advertise same day, you should make sure that it really is.\n\nYesterday morning, I went back in to see if it was ready.\nNope.  It hadn't been touched yet.  \n\nOk again...not a HUGE deal.  I ask how late are you open, and the guy says \""At least...8.\"" \n\nDo you not know your own hours?  At least 8.  That's a new one.  \n\nSo when I got off work yesterday, I stopped by, at about 6:20.  The girl took my ticket, and asked, with tremendous attitude \""When did you drop this off.\""  \n\n...\""Yesterday morning. And I was told THIS morning that it would be ready tonight.\""\n\nSo she looks, and she finds it.\n$4.50.  Not bad.  I hand her a $10 bill. \n\nHer: *sigh* \""Do you have 50 cents?\""\n\nMe...\""no, sorry.\"" Thinking to myself \""If I had, I'd have given it to you...\""\n\nShe sulks around the corner to find my change and begrudgingly hands me the $5.50.  \n\nAnd then, HOW DARE I ask for a receipt.  \n\""Its on the item.\""\n\nOk fine lady, I didn't know!  \nAnd next time, don't laugh at your customer for asking.\n\nIf they were not near my house and very inexpensive, I'd never use this company again.  There is never an excuse for rude service.  Ever.  \n\nI'll be looking for a new dry cleaning place, but would return here if I ABSOLUTELY had to.  They do a good job on the clothes, and are inexpensive, but service sucks."
21827,4,"My boyfriend and I ordered an appetizer and an entree to share before going out to the clubs, so we didn't want to stuff ourselves.  We ordered a gnoochi appetizer which was amazing and for our entree we got the seared duck.  To our surprise, I believe the owner came out, and brought us out two dishes of the duck.  We had a full meal and didn't have to share and they didn't charge us for the extra plate!  The duck was amazing!!  Cooked to perfection!  Beautiful restaurant and delicious food.  Can't wait to come back and try their fixed menu!  Thank you Aureole!"
30690,2,"Place is relatively priced right for the yogurt shops around town. The staff is nice for the most part, been in there on a slow night and it seemed like they wanted to get out of there, cant blame them sometimes! Toppings haven't looked the freshest before but for the most part they have a nice selection. I hate the location having to turn in on the one side then go up and do a u-turn to go back the other way, really big pain. Otherwise I like this place."
34257,0,"This place is extremely overpriced.  The service was ok, but I don't understand how you can charge $14 for a PBR in a brown bag with a shot of Jack.  That is criminal.  I had the $18 buffalo burger which I could hardly taste because the bun was so gigantic and the fries tasted like had come out of a frozen bag.  I will not go back to this PUB.  There much better places to eat in Vegas."
29244,1,"Bullet point summary:\n\n- Prices are not terribly expensive for airport food\n- Don't expect great service. Remember, it's airport fast food\n- Chicken based burritos are awful here. \n- Tofu veggie burrito and shrimp burrito are better, get those\n- Small. Chipotle has spoiled us all. This is a \""normal\"" sized burrito which is about 70% of the size of a Chipotle one\n- Pre ready and packed salsas are nice to grab quickly. But, there is a catch: they all are terrible. \n\nRemember also that this airport has so few decent food options that relative to others, so I cannot say \""avoid, go elsewhere\"" since the going elsewhere is actually pretty hard to do.\n\nOverall, not terrible, not good, so 2 stars."

Walter and I walked in here. \""10 top for Walter\"". he said oh WOW TEN. OK. He seemed happy about that. We got this whole nook in the back near the restrooms for our large party. Our server was awesome. He spoke both English and Spanish. When I realized that he was more comfy speaking in Spanish,  I was happy to order that way as well. He was quick to bring out our food. The only thing that we had to ask for was extra condiments. Everything else, he was on top of it. We were a loud bunch but not a rowdy one. Our bills were all done separately. SMART server!!

10632,3,Excellent place to cab to if staying on the strip (about $7 from the Bellagio)  Cab service back to our hotel was a breeze as well.  The service was polite and attentive.

But then it was paired with something (spinach) that was inedible. Seriously, I don't know how one makes spinach taste like that, my only guess would be artificial flavoring. Yes, it's that type of place. Then cap it off with cheap wine that'll give you a killer headache and some sweet hot chocolate standing in for coffee. Blech."
12296,1,"Was just here this past weekend, as I took my cousin to Vegas for his 21st! Heard good things about the Palms, so decided to book my first stay here, as it seems to be one of the few hotels in Vegas I have not stayed at. For starters, the service sucked. We flew in on Friday night, pulled up in a limo (hey, I was trying to impress my cousin), and could not get a bell person to help us for several, several minutes. When I let the front desk know about it, her response was that there was only one man working for all of the people checking in. ARE YOU KIDDING?? THIS IS FRIDAY NIGHT IN VEGAS? This lady at the front desk didn't really seem to care, so I asked to see a manager. She let me know who the manager was and pointed her out, Stella was her name. Stella walked by several times and absolutely ignored me, to which the response I received was, \""oh, well Stella is off the clock, and our other manager is busy\"". Furious was an understatement at this point. Finally I reached Theta(? I think  was her name?) and she actually gave a shit. She heard me out a lot. In fact, she is the only reason this place is getting more than 1 star. She upgraded my room to a suite and apologized, nice gesture, Still, every time I called room service, front desk, house-keeping, or concierge, the line was busy my ENTIRE stay. In our hotel room we had (I think) 9 TVs, which is cool, except NONE of them worked properly. This place has gone in the shitter. Vegas has so many options for great hotels, I would not stay here again."
30677,2,"I gave this three stars only b/c they do not offer a gluten free menu and there is not much to eat here. I ordered a pittsburgh salad and I couldn't even get the fries b/c they had a flour coating...the fries make the salad. \n\nThey have decent stuffed hot peppers, their steaks arent bad. \n\nDecently priced, if you go for lunch expect to have a long lunch. They are fairly slow."

I'd seen Phantom in 1990 with the original cast in Toronto at the Pantages Theater.

He was so successful in being charming and creepy at the same time.

What a wonderful experience.\n\nI would love to go back again before they close down in September!!!!!"

30502,2,"I'm wife and I have been here twice and the food here is really good, although there are a couple of misses with the Maki. The service is about average, and the one thing I would complain about is that (in our most recent trip) our food came in a really weird sequence and with significant time gaps between dishes. We ordered some tapas and sushi, and we expected the tapas to come first but they last. We spent some time waiting between dishes which was a bit annoying. Also, their kitchen is right there in the open with the sushi bar and it is a bit unpleasant/distracting to look at and hear all the sounds from clanging dishes. The first time we came here we loved it but this last time we noticed a lot more things that took away from our experience."

15146,1,"I suppose I should have taken the complete absence of a wait to be seated (at 8pm on a Saturday night no less) as a bad sign.  My girlfriend and I were attracted by the advertised special of filet mignon dinner (complete with soup/salad) for $17.\n\nThe soup was a creamy chicken vegetable which reminded me of Thanksgiving, and it would have been pretty good had it not been luke-warm.  The filet mignon came with a hollandaise sauce, roasted potatoes and some steamed asparagus and green beans.  The filet had nice grill marks, which inspired some hope, but it was over-cooked, under-seasoned, and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.  The potatoes were pretty tasty, but the veggies were under-seasoned as well.\n\nWe also ordered some mushroom crepes.  These were the best thing about the meal, but not by far, and I am not exactly a crepe expert.  They tasted similar to the soup to me.  Perhaps some cross-pollination going on?\n\nThe proximity to our hotel elevators and a friendly (albeit somewhat inattentive) waiter helped redeem some value on the experience, but all-in-all, I think I could have executed the meal better in my own kitchen.\n\nBottom line: There are lots of great restaurants in Vegas, so, unless you are trying to avoid long lines at the dinner rush, you may want to consider more options."

Asked what happened and his excuse was that he was not here, ok you are now....ridiculous. If you're going to add an automated service make sure it works, maybe you should consider adding an audible alarm so people know that an order needs to be filled (since you have many people rotating in and out of the area)\nI just told him to forget it and went to checkout."

10523,2,"Went for a quick lunch (before we had to leave for the airport) and it was just fine.  The atmosphere is modern, prices are reasonable, and the location was prime.  The service wasn't the best - we had to ask for our server at least 5 times before he came over....twice.  \n\nFood:  had the $15ish chicken salad, which sounded similar to Corner Bakery's chicken salad (yum!).  This was not as flavorful but was fine because the raisin bread which it was served on was yummy.  I'd rather have Corner Bakery's, especially at $6!\n\n3 people ordered the primer burger - 2 ordered theirs medium, 1 asked for medium well.  All of ours came out medium rare (bright red \""bleeding\"" in the middle of our burger).  The medium people dealth with it and ate...but it was unacceptable for the person who ordered the med well (rightfully so!) - it took 10 min for them to take it back and then another 10 min for them to bring back the same burger that came out very charred on the outside.  \n\nGood for lunch, wouldn't go for dinner.

There was hardly any one there so in a sense we had the place to ourselves. \n\nWe bid 75 on priceline and got the standard studio but upgraded (for 20/night) when we saw how small and dark the studio was. The rooms themselves were clean but needed serious remodeling: you have to connect your lap top using the old S-video to the old tv set if you want to watch a DVD, the showers leaked, the lighting is outdated, and we had to call maintenance to replace the washer on our facet. \n\nOverall, I think we overpaid a bit, but not by much.

27309,0,"Ok. On the advice of a few friends who have been living in Scottsdale for a little while, I decided to take the gf here for her Bday as Mexican is her fav. We're both from Manhattan and are used to getting damn good street tacos and decent Mexican food. So we come here dressed casual chic and apparently the hordes of locals, many of whom I suspect make 30K a year but acted like they make 1 million plus, were dressed in suits and such. Keep in mind, I am in investment banking and my gf is in fashion so when saw this, were were giggling inside. However, this apparently warranted sub-par service as the waitstaff was apparently ignorant and knows not what they do. No surprise here as Scottsdale and most of the area can be accurately described as trailer trash trying really hard to pretend they live in a real city and actually have real jobs. So what we do is what we always do when we try a \""hot restaurant\"" for the first time, we order the one dish that a place like this should never screw up. We ordered tacos. The meat tasted like it was pulled from some frozen TV dinner box, smothered with way too much sauce and overly salted. We decided to end the night right then and there. It was an absolute disgrace. We have had much better tacos at holes in the walls on random streets in NYC. I still don't understand how this place gets such raves and high reviews. Maybe they've never tasted real, authentic Latin/Mexican food before and this is the only thing they have to benchmark against. Such a sad state of affairs, like so many things in AZ."

But that's a separate review for Chase Field the venue itself. Just go out there and support your home team. They work very hard on and off the field for the fans and this community, why not go support them, your Arizona Diamondbacks and have a hot dog while your at it!"

43148,1,"If you are a merchant don't go to this bank. Their 'policy' is to take whoever walks in first. My question is, Why even have a merchant line at all if you are going to treat everyone the same? However, it is a convenience we as business accounts pay for many times over. It may not sound like a big problem but when you go to the bank every day for your job and people who walk in after you are getting seen before you it makes your head spin. And that happens because not all the tellers ask who was there first."
11742,0,"I have never heard of Via Delosantos but my sister told me the food was amazing and she was shocked I have never heard of this place. While I was waiting to be seated I pulled up Yelp on my phone and started reading reviews. Arik B's review was funny as hell but also scared the shit out of me. The chips and salsa were good but not great. The rice and beans were blah. The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese. I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible. My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that. During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking \"" Dammit Arik B was right\""!"
31946,2,"For such a thin pizza, it's really overpriced. I ordered extra cheese as a topping, and it was barely any cheese on the pizza. \nThe pizza is much different from what I am usually used to. \n\nThey have only a few items to choose from on the menu, like salad and pizza choices only. \n\nIf it gets cold it pretty much has to be thrown out because it gets really hard even when heated up. \n\nGreat thing about this place is that they use a coal oven. That's really good, it always makes pizza better. \n\nThe pizza was decent, but just not my type."
24097,2,"I'm sure the problem is with me...I'm on a salty kick at present and really crave brie and oysters and fresh salsa and (as usual) pho.  \n\nI drove 30 minutes to this place.\n\nNice, bright, modern interior. Friendly people. Beautifully laid out display of cookies and pastries and fudge and cakes.\n\nThe people ahead of me were buying red velvet cupcakes (naked) and gettting them iced to go. They looked fabulous. **\n\nI tried a raspberry linzer torte, Italian wedding cookies, a gingerbread man (welll,  his foot and part of his head, courtesy of my daughter), and a cream puff filled with custard.\n\nI didn't expect to like the coffee better than the pastries, but I did. \n\nThey were FINE, really. I'm sure most people would have been in love. Like I said, I'm sure it's me. It was just too sweet. \n\nNot going to drive that far, when I have a Fresh Market close at hand, and a Dean & Delucas within 10 minutes or so.\n\n**Edited to say:  I need to specify that the CUPCAKES were naked and looked fabulous, not the people. They were fully covered."
4822,3,"If you are look for a good place to eat at Vegas and it is after 10:00PM this is the place to go. You would want to come with an empty stomach since this place is a All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. I dare you to come out of this place not smelling like Korean BBQ. So if you plan to go to a party after you might wanna bring a change of clothes. If this is your first time trying Korean BBQ let me tell you that the smell will linger on your clothes and hair. \n\nThis is an AYCE location starting at 10:00pm-2:00am and it only cost $18-20 depending on the tipping amount. This is a great deal since NYC prices are outrageous of this type of food. Along with the Korean BBQ meat that you order it comes with Banchan. Banchan are small tradition Korean side dishes such as kimchee, bean sprout, fish cake, pancake etc. If these dishes run out you can always ask for more. I am used to my basket of fresh lettuce but instead they served chop lettuce with some dressing. This is a complete shock to me, maybe the basket of fresh lettuce is a NYC thing. The basket of fresh lettuce here is served like a salad with a fresh sesame dressing. \n\nI will recommend  this brisket, marinated pork belly and sliced sliced rib-eye. I will stay away from the squid because it comes really elastic when it is cooked. The marinated pork belly was my favorite because it comes with so much favor. Keep in mind that this place does not change the Korean BBQ grill. Since the pork belly is marinated the grill turns black quicker and they will not replace it until you finish the dinner. \n\nThe restaurant is split into two parts. When you walk in the left side is for Korean BBQ quest. They have 6 tables that can seat 4 people each and 3 long table that can hold at least 8 individuals. The right side are for guest who do not want to eat Korean BBQ but just want Korean food. \n\nThe only reason this place lost a star is because of service and the wait. I came at 10:03pm and had to wait for an hour to get seated. The service is slow and they seem like zombies. When the table before us finish eating it took 10 minutes to clean the table and when the table was clean the waitress did not call us until another 10 minutes has passed. So the turn around rate for the table is around 20 minutes because they lack the help. Since only two people are working it takes a lot longer for wait and the meat to come out. If they hired more help this place would have earn five stars. \n\nHint: When you walk in place your name, time you came in and number in your party on that sheet of paper near the door. This place get pack after 10:15pm!"
19531,3,"My husband and I went here on a weekend in Phoenix that was actually pleasant and mild! The weather definitely helped improve my opinion of the place, as it is an outdoor restaurant.\nWe had a slight wait on the Sunday morning that we went, which we didn't mind at all because of the lovely scenery at The Farm @ South Mountain. It definitely makes you forget that you are in the middle of the desert.\nWe were seated at a 4-top, even though we were only a party of 2. It was nice to have the extra room! I got the American Breakfast, which included 2 scrambled eggs, home fries, applewood smoked bacon and a DELICIOUS biscuit that we had to order 2 more of, they were that good! \nMy husband had the local Schreiner's sausage, tomato and cheese omelette, which he really enjoyed, but I think he could have easily eaten a slightly larger portion.\nThe food was really great! We had a really sweet server as well.\nThe only complaint I have is that they had what looked like an all-you-can-drink beverage bar, where they were serving lemonade, tea and water from big canteens in plastic cups. Of course, we grabbed 2 drinks thinking \""Oh, how nice!\"" Unfortunately, both drinks turned up on our tab. I would have appreciated someone warning us that they charge for the drink bar.\nBut, that's OK. Now I am more informed and I would definitely come back here!"

19637,2,First let me say that the cake tasted awesome. I ordered chocolate with peanut butter mousse and buttercream icing. The problem was the design/decorate of the cake. It was not at all what I expected and they didn't even write what I asked them to on the cake. \nThe cake was for a guys 30th birthday and the design looked like it was for a elderly person. \nIf your going to order a cake it will taste good just be very very specific about the design you want.

34838,2,"The buffet for Saturday night is 26.95 per person as of this writing. I would consider it a good deal at 20, but 27 is a bit too high. Some food was fantastic. The steak and salmon were very good, and the peanut butter chocolate cream pie was fantastic, rich but not heavy. One standout low was the so-called French onion soup, which was made with (I kid you not) reconstituted onions, almost identical to the grody ones McDonald's puts on its burgers. A cup of Lipton instant soup would have been better. I suppose that would be (barely) okay for a 7 dollar cheap ass buffet, but wholly unacceptable when dropping close to 30 dollars for a meal.  Fresh onions just aren't that expensive, and while a good French Onion soup takes a while to make, it's not labor intensive at all and an acceptable one should be easily in reach of any certificate holder from a culinary school. \n\nBasically, I'm reinforcing what others have said; what's good is very good, what's not good is downright bad."
13794,2,"This definitely isn't the best buffet in Vegas, but it will do in a pinch. I paid extra for unlimited alcohol (champagne), and was a little surprised when it arrived at my table served in a plastic water cup. Oh, well...it's all going down the same way, anyway! I don't know that I'd necessarily visit this buffet again (as Rachel S. noted, the interior is pretty drab and is reminiscent of a hospital cafeteria).  The food wasn't much better than what you would get at a Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral.  BUT...bonus points to our waitress; she was super sweet and before she got off her shift, she snuck over and left me with an entire BOTTLE of my own champagne. What a doll!"

6085,0,"I went there to have a tire checked because it had a slow leak. After a thirty minute wait, they said there was no problem with the tire and that the aluminum wheel was leaking. They put a sealant on the inside of the rim and advised that it was a temporary fix and would leak again in the future. A day later I still had a leak. I took the car to another garage and they found a small hole in my tire within 5 minutes! Oh and they charged half of what NTB did. Take your car somewhere else!"
13013,2,"This place is so strange! A fireside lounge on one side and a diner-style restaurant on the other?! This review is for the restaurant only.\n\nThe fake trees and flowers and colorful lights are a bit cheesy, but I really like it! Makes for beautiful pictures! There's also a guy coming around to the tables taking pictures trying to get you to buy them. They're super cute, but does anyone actually buy those?!\n\nThe portions are HUGE HUGE HUGE. The two of us couldn't finish an omlette, a bowl of clam chowder, and a milkshake! Hell, we only finished half of it! We're big eaters too x_x I don' remember which omlette we ordered, but it had a lot of meat and it was okay at first but pretty sickening after a while. The vanilla shake was good. It's the thick kind, which usually isn't my thing. Clam chowder was way too salty and just not good. I think a can of Campbell's Chunky clam chowder is 100x better! \n\nI think the Peppermill would be a perfect late night filler, but I don't think I'd come here again unless I was seeking out drunk food."
13789,3,"An unexpected treat from my \""auntie\"" from France and a nice gesture by an employee to move my cane-assisted 'uncle\"" to the front of the long line got Saturday evening started right.  Well, almost right because I hadn't been preparing all day for a buffet...\n\n(Ironically, the seater then made us walk, uncle and all, all the way to the back corner of the place.)\n\nDecent amount of variety, although a lot of it wasn't premium buffet stuff. King crab and prime rib were obviously the best picks overall, but I liked a lot of the other dishes, including the 4th of July special pulled beef with baked beans, the lamb kebobs and baba ghanouj, the fried shrimp (overly battered but still good), the italian sausage... mmm. Desserts were good too, especially the creme brulee and apple pie for me. Also, that frozen custard just somehow tastes different from the usual frozen yogurt...\n\nOverall, it was a great meal, but not quite an unforgettable variety of victuals.\n\nP.S. A foursquare check-in at the proper Planet Hollywood Resort can get you $5 off for this buffet."
26828,1,"So I read the reviews and expected this place to be great. Needless to say did not reach my expectations at all. First off its a smoking environment and I went for dinner it just doesn't sit well with me. The service was slow and not too friendly. We ordered cheese sticks (cold, nothing special), beer battered pickles (way too greasy and pickles were to soggy) and the beer battered BBQ chicken sandwich (the beer batter was so over cooked it was almost black and I couldn't even eat it) we tried cutting up it and removing the batter but it was so much work for a sandwich we heard so many good things about. The garlic Parmesan fries was not in the slightest garlicy. All said and done my boyfriend didn't even touch his sandwich. It was a flop for us. The beer was good though."
42307,4,"We r from chicago and came to khyber halal after reading positive reviews on yelp. The restaurant is charming, quaint, and well - decorated with authentic afghani decor and pieces, also very clean. The owner/head chef Fahima greeted us and was our server. She was incredibly pleasant and gave us great recommendations. She discussed that she tries to use organic ingredients and tries to make dishes healthy for her customers. All of her meat entrees are halal.\n\nOur first visit we had beef samosa and shami kabob for appetizers. Each came with fresh green chutney and tasted as if she had just freshly hand made the dough, meat, and chutney. We ate afghani dishes including kabli pulao and uzbek pulao, both spectacular. The helpings of rice are heaping, and you'll definitely have leftovers. Thr prices are very reasonable.\n\nSince our visit, my family reminisced about the delicious taste of her food every meal in phoenix, nothing compared. We came back and tried her pakistani dishes, equally delicious! Her naan is so plump and tastes made in a tandoor.  This place is always crowded and filled with a diverse crowd.  Mango lassi is perfect after a morning hike. Dessert including phirni and baklawa taste homemade.\n\nWe will probably b back again during our vacation, but wanted to post this since I am truly in love with this place. The owner Fahima is incredibly talented and will probably b known as a great chef in the near future.  \n\nIf you are in phoenix, definitely visit this place, your taste buds will not forget it!"
41446,1,"I've been to this place several times and LOVED it!! BUT.. this time; not so much! The only person that speaks english was not there, so trying to communicate with anyone was a challenge. I have always asked for \""Andy\"" cause he does such a good job, but this time he was busy, so I got one of the ladies. The therapists were chatting with each other, and it was very distractive. The lady I had seemed very rushed and bothered. Not the best experience this time.. After my massage I walked back to the restroom and noticed a man being ushered in to a private room in the back with a door.. I thought this was weird and asked myself \""Why does he get a private room and my friend and I were out in the open and had to listen to all the distracting noises. I really hope nothing illegal is being done.. I don't condone this behavior and am not 100% decided if I will be returning."
18726,3,"I arrived at the Breakfast Joynt on the earlier side today to set up for the Elite Event... and since they were still open and I had a couple of hours to kill, I decided it was time to treat my toes to a little pedicure action!\n\nMinus one star for having to wait about 15 minutes (after i called to make an appointment).  It was worth the wait though...\n\nFirst of all, the salon is extremely clean.  You gotta like that!  Tammy did my pedicure and the guy who took my appointment, Shawn, brought me a bottle of water during the heavenly experience.  I went with the 'basic' spa pedicure.  It was $25 before tip.  It included the basics plus a wonderful massage and they even used a hot rag and hot stone after the regular massage!  Polish selection and application were not perfect, but then again, neither are my toenails!\n\nAs I was leaving, Shawn gave me some coupons , so I may just have to return for a manicure next time!  One tip - they take credit cards but you must tip in cash, so make sure to bring some dollar bills with you!"
9347,3,If you are on a low-carb diet you can order the saiman without noodles and with veggies instead. I think I was charged around ~$4. They gave me bean sprouts and napa. Also still had the roast pork with it. Still a decent serving size and was pretty filling.

45385,4,"I know all y'all care about is what to order, so ima get right to it: Brussel Sprouts, Buta Shishito (not spicy), Crudo (probably my favorite dish), Sake Orenji (extremely refreshing), Pokuyaki, bluefin tuna, karaage, carafe of sake sangria, & GREENIES (I would come here just for the dessert).\n\nApparently their HH has changed from 5p-7p to 5p-6:30p so get there early! We arrived close to 6p on a Tuesday night (during Magic convention week, mind you) and it was empty, score!! Service was prompt, friendly, and conversational. We had Charlie as our server and he was awesome! I almost want to ask for him next time we go. Everyone was super friendly and involved in our experience, cleaning, recommending, etc. \n\nHonestly I keep thinking about this place and plan to bring every single one of my friends back. Mad love to Yonaka."
11217,1,"The noodles before the meal was good. Ordered from the Korean section, got a bowl of noodles floating in fishy, soupy cornstarch, no taste, but smelled fishy. BBQ ribs were soft, but seemed like bottled sauce was poured over the top right before serving. Very disappointed"
16222,2,"HUGE PORTIONS. HUGE. This place is inside the crappy Imperial Palace hotel on the strip (upstairs).  I was surprised at how big the place was, it is kind of sectioned off into two difference rooms. I had a simple breakfast with eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit and coffee to drink. The biscuit was so buttery and fresh and warm, and like everything here HUGE. I usually love me some carbs, but I could not finish the biscuit or the rest of the meal. The food was great the prices matched the huge portions, not overprices but accordingly to the amount of food you get. My entree was one of the simpler ones and it was 9 bucks, everything else was above that. Only bad experience was someone straight threw up in there. Was walking aND \""bleeaaaaacgh!\"" *splaash*. I was confused as to what happened when I heard it and saw a guy running out, until I saw the horrified look on a puke-splattered woman. I am assuming the patron had a rough night of drinking in Vegas and that it wasn't the food there. Still pretty horrific to witness on your first meal of the day.\nFinal thought :This would be a good spot to pig out in...maybe wear rain gear...?"
20814,0,"Nice hotel for young people bad experience, dealers were rude made sexual comments about my wife, the operator when i called wouldnt look up my reservation, the food at koi was a joke, Worst Hotel I have stayed in and I go to vegas a lot, dont waste your money"
40286,1,"I've been to other ihop locations, but this one seems to be sub par.   We were seated quickly, and the waitress was ready to take our order immediately.  Our waitress was super awkward and the service was poor. She must have asked us what we would like to order about 3 times in two minutes.  Are we not allowed to look over the menu?  I ordered the strawberry banana french toast because it looked and sounded amazing on the menu.   I was severely underwhelmed.  If sugary syrupy half frozen strawberries on thinly sliced bread is your thing, you might love it! \n\n\nWhen checking out, they were trying to tell me I needed an ID to use my visa debit card.  They hassled me for about 10 minutes over a $10 purchase. It wouldn't have been a big deal, but my ID was at home.  Visa strictly prohibits merchants to require and ID with a signed debit card, so I didnt bring it. Get it together ihop. \n\n\nI gave two stars for cleanliness, but I won't return."
33493,1,"This place is waaaaaaay overrated!  I agree with the person who was talking about the wet carpets!  We got off our elevator and saw disgusting brown wet spots on the carpet WTF?  And it smelled funny!  \n\nWe got to our room, the woman at the desk really hyped up the room saying oh you're getting one of our most requested rooms that have a beautiful view of the bellagio fountains and the strip.  We open the door to our room and my friend instantly said it smells like a skunk in here!  And I agree it had this faint smell of a skunk or musty smell in the room.  Excited to see the view of the fountains we open the curtains to find a window so dirty on the outside you couldn't see any fountains!  I've NEVER been to a hotel with windows so dirty you cannot even see out of them!\n\nOverall the room wasn't that clean for what we were paying.  The lighting sucked.  the bathroom light didn't work, the ceiling light bulbs were going in and out in the main area of the room.  It's kind of a more girly hotel, so to have such poor lighting in the room is very disappointing!\n\nAlso, when they cleaned our room, they actually took soap and 2 other items they provided the first day off the shelf which I definitely thought was strange, usually they give you more the next day.\n\nI'm only giving this place 2 starts because at least the sheets were clean and the casino itself was beautiful with all the chandeliers.  But honestly it only deserves 1.5 stars, you should never have dirty windows or a smelly room.  Won't be staying here again!"
38403,1,"My husband and I did not have a good experience here. I saw on the menu online that they have bruschetta, and so I was craving it for about a week. When we walked in, the place was small and very dark.  We seated ourselves, ordered waters, and looked over the menu. The waitress had a bit of a 'tude, and kept asking what drinks we wanted to order. Um, sometimes people just don't want to order a drink. Sue me. So we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the chicken salad to split. The bruschetta was so-so; not quite what I wanted. We got the salami and pesto, goat cheese and cranberry relish and feta, olive and tomato. They were a bit sparse with the toppings. The salad was actually very good, but I wish they used chunk chicken instead of sliced deli meat. Overall I will not be back. I will stick with Postino's."
24940,3,"Thanks to fellow Yelpers, I gave this salon and Mariana a try for my long-overdue haircut.  Before I start repeating a lot of what others have already said, readers of this review should put some stock in the consistency of the four, now five reviews of this salon and this stylist.  Five different people over the course of six months have all had good experiences here!\n\nSalon is located just a couple of doors down from the Polka Dot Bakery (not one of my favorites!) and close to Total Wine.  Easy access from Park Road and Woodlawn Road and plenty of free parking.  Decor is minimalist and today was apparently Latin music day - energetic and happy and I couldn't understand a word of it.\n\nMariana's service was outstanding!  The shampoo was the most relaxing I've ever had in a salon.  Don't tell the management, but they could sell that service alone and charge for it!  Mariana took her time with the cut to make sure it was done just right and to my liking.  She even asked how much or how little I want to fuss with my hair every day - the answer made an impact on exactly how she did the cut.  Who wouldn't want great results with low daily maintenance?\n\nBecause of an earlier Yelp comment, I came prepared to pay the tip in cash.  But when I was presented with my credit card charge slip to sign, there was a space to add the tip to the credit card so perhaps this has now changed.\n\nI like this salon and I really like this stylist!  So go (they take walk ins) and go often.  I want them to stay in business.  I was a little scared because at 12 noon on a Monday, Mariana and I were the only ones in the place!  She did say the place had been a zoo over the holidays so perhaps it was just my timing.  Price for shampoo, cut and blow dry style was $30 plus a tip - very reasonable for Charlotte."
32209,2,"The place that I was taking some training from ordered our daily lunches from this sandwich shop. Based on the menu we were given to select from I figured that the school was giving us a limited selection of the full offering to keep things simple when they have to order for a couple dozen people.\n\nAfter looking at the menu online I estimate that this is not the case. Sub Station II seems to be just a simple \""Ham & Cheese\"" type of place. They have a selection of deli meats, a range of your typical toppings, and a few choices or bread or wrap. I don't think you're going to find a meatball or philly cheesesteak kind of sandwich here.\n\nThe first couple of days I gave the salads a go. The were kind of bland as you get a bed of shredded lettuce with pre-selected toppings and the sliced up deli meat. On the other days I gave a few sandwiches a try. They were alright. No complaints, but these subs certainly weren't anything beyond what I could make at home.\n\nWhat I did like about this place was that they delivered each sandwich in its own plastic container with our sides and cookie inside. They also wrote our names on the container so when it came time to eat there was no confusion about which sandwich was which."
44386,0,I will never go back there again... we had 9 people all of us nicely dressed except for my brother in law that flew in from Hawaii (marine) for his sisters  birthday. he was wearing a polo jeans and work boots.. we were at VB GB for a while and then went to Ohso for a drink.. the birthday girl wanted to dance so we figured to head to Label.. the cover charge was 15 bucks.  and they wouldn't let in my brother in law because he had on boots.. then proceeded to blame it on his attitude after they wouldn't let him in.. I just think it's really wrong to not let in somebody that serving your country.  he's 25 and mature enough to handle a situation and not hurt anybody with his boots..

And people obviously don't know that when a movie starts at 8pm, you're not supposed to drive up & down the lanes at 9pm, blinding people with your lights or blocking the movie. I missed a good portion of The Avengers, and beside the price being right, I probably won't come here again, at least with kids."
46516,2,"I really wanted to like this place more. \n\nLike everyone already said, it's hard to find. Although they do have little signs on the lamp posts that let you know you missed the building, cause it's bound to happen.  The restaurant is just too small, although I did go over lunch and it was incredibly busy. But it was off-putting. We couldn't sit until someone else got up from a table, and that just felt a tad awkward.\n\nI ordered the burger benedict. It was OK. Apart from the fried egg in the burger, nothing was \""benedict\"" about the burger. I was thinking it would have hollandaise on it or something a bit more. And the burger meat was slightly underseasoned. The truffle fries are epic though and very addicting.\n\nThe bf had the neato burrito. It was a breakfast burrito. Nothing remarkable about it.\n\nWe tried them at Bite of Las Vegas and actually enjoyed it more there. I got the Chix on Broadway there, which was super yummy. Bacon makes everything better. We also tried the ahi siracha tacos. I know these are one of their best sellers, but I just thought they were OK.\n\nLike I said, I really wanted to like this place, but it was just OK. I probably won't be back anytime soon, at least not until they expand or something."
26506,3,"I went around 2:30 am the other day and tried their cookies for the first time. I am still thinking about it...enough for me to write a review at 1:30 am. Try their white chocolate macadamia sooooo good, the chocolate chunk, not so much."
18812,0,Came because they claim to cut high tech auto keys. Not only did I not get a key cut but I was told they could not cut the key for my Honda. If you are going to advertise that you cut high tech keys then you should be able to.
46339,2,Had to drop my rating a couple of stars because they never offer the trout for the 3 course lunch special anymore.  The trout is what really made the lunch special great.
26811,3,We went here in May for dinner.  Beautiful setting.  It was still nice in the evening so we sat outside.  The Chicken Liver Pate was SO DELICIOUS as were the Popovers!  My husband and I shared the Prime Porterhouse for Two (cooked perfectly) as well as a side of Jalepeno Mashed Potatoes and Creamy Spinach.  The side dishes were pretty small but we shared with each other.  Everything tasted great.\n\nService was very attentive.  This was a splurge for us and we enjoyed it.  I would recommend going here if it were for a special occasion.  The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because it is cost prohibitive for us to visit on a regular basis (is that selfish of me?).
35665,0,"First off I want to say to all the 1 star reviewers, you have my full sympathy! This place is so misleading it is unbelievable!!! My wife and I booked a two night stay here through Hotels.com because they advertised pretty well and the pictures didn't look too shaby at all. But we shure were fooled! When we arrived it turned out check in time wasn't till 3pm and they were understaffed apparently because the bell boy/girl was doing her job and tending their ridiculous bar! Anyways, when we got to our room it was literally not cleaned; the house keeping girl was (who looked like she was 16 years of age) still cleaning up our room! This made my wife and I real disappointed. I am usually against discrimination but for this review I have to say that when I go to a hotel I expect to see  housekeeping ladies (between her late 30's/40's)  with experience not  housekeeping girls who are barely 18 years of age that do a half ass job! \n\nBut going back to the room situation, we went back down to the front desk to get a new room. Once we mentioned to the front desk dude that are room wasn't even ready he put on this phony look of shock, which he probably wouldn't of displayed if there wasn't a line waiting to check in! So he told us he was sorry and gave us a new room which was supposed to be an \""upgrade\"" from his words, trying to make us feel better. Though yet again, disapointment was on its way. The only real \""upgrade\"" that we got in the new room is that we didn't find housekeeping in it! It was pretty much the same room as the first with just a slightly larger bed and only one dirty towel left in it! We tried our hardest to make the most of what we got for our money but in the end we still got ripped off on our $120 stay for two nights.\n\nSo don't be fooled about this joke of a hotel. The only \""Rumor\"" about this hotel that should be floating around is how bad it is! And it shure as hell aint no \""Boutique\""!"
10526,2,"I visited Wolfgang Buck's Postrio Bar & Grill for lunch and wanted a gourmet  soup and sandwich, and let us not forget dessert.\n\nTo start...  I read the menu online and had hoped to try the puree of sweet corn soup but the menu had changed.  I tried the pumpkin soup, as it is the holiday season, and I liked it.\n\nLuckily, the lobster club sandwich I wanted to try wasn't left off the menu.  I take pleasure in trying a restaurant's twist on a classic, like the club, and the apple wood smoked bacon worked with nine grain bread but overwhelmed the lobster.  The classic or the twist?  It's a toss up.\n\nTo finish...  The meal ended a lot like it began, a changed up dessert menu, but I can't complain.  Not after eating an appetizing apple strudel coupled with pecan ice cream and a caramel.  Yum.  Yum.\n\nUnfortunately, I was underwhelmed.  Yelp's reviews were up and down, but Wolfgang Buck's Cut and Spago in Los Angeles are amongst my favorite restaurants.  I'd happily eat here again, but I wouldn't walk up and down Las Vegas Blvd. to try some selections from their menu, which may or may not be there after I've arrived."
43357,0,TL:DR - Food Poisoning\n\nSo on a recent business trip to Las Vegas I visited this restaurant twice. First time was on a Thursday night and the restaurant was extremely slow.  Only 3 tables in use in the restaurant.  It took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us.  When I asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... About the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. Still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. The pizza was amazing. The best pizza and worst service I have ever had. \n\nI went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. I explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better.  The next morning I woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. Flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  I am 100% sure of the source of the food poisoning as I only ate one thing on that day... Grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. The salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. I suggest avoiding this spot at all costs.
44531,4,"Milunka is great at her craft ! I had my first facial with her and she's amazing. She did extractions, which I needed and now my skin feels fantastic !"
32696,3,"We tried to find this place last time we were in town but failed.  So glad we tried again.  Got there early, got a great seat outside.  They were awesome with our son and made sure we knew about the off menu kids items.  Our server (Haley?) was great with him as well and very attentive.  The food was solid and the beer selection as well.  We will definitely be back."
45429,1,Editing my review from 5/5 to 2/5. Was my second experience at Layla's and everything was great including the food and vibe. The service was a little slow when it got busy so that's to be expected and not a big deal. \n\nThe reason for my edit on this review is because I woke up this morning throwing up the food I ordered(Shawarma plate). Could be an isolated incident but after the whole Firefly thing you never know.
14022,4,I can't believe i haven't reviewed this show.  This was my first ever Vegas show because what can you really do in Vegas being 19 or 20 without a fake id.  \n\nI had an interest in cirque du soleil shows previously (watching it on tv) but after seeing this show i fell in LOVE with cirque du soleil productions.  \n\nI had the best seats ever courtesy of my friends dad's gaming habits :o)  It was dead center and only a few rows up from the stage.  This show was phenomenal.  The acrobatic sequences kept me on the edge of my seat.  The platform that the whole show was performed on was amazingly built.  This is a must see show and money well spent!!!
44379,1,"I/we have eaten at the Chop several times in the past year and any time we sit elsewhere besides sitting at the bar, our service has been horrible. I hate asking the waiter/waitress to refill my water or coffee cup over and over again, especially when the restaurant is charging you $12.00 for a martini. On a positive side, historically the food has always been excellent. Last night after sharing a few appetizers, my wife and I shared a fresh sea bass dinner for $29.50, which was very tasty. However, for $29.50 (which I thought was priced high to begin with) you would think the total size of the serving would be larger then about 4-5 ounces. I believe our days of dinning at the Chop has come to a halt."
46189,1,"Unfortunately I didn't have a good experience here... I took my Mother to lunch for the first time and we both ordered salads. The cashier asked us if we wanted to add chicken - we both replied \""yes\"" and she said \""cold or grilled\"" - we both said grilled. Our total bill was a little higher than expected so my mom nicely asked why. The girl was extremely rude and said, \""grilled chicken is more.\""  and basically laughed at my mom for even asking the question... We were not rude, we did not ask for it to be taken off the bill - just a simple question. I've worked in the service industry for years and it rubs me the wrong way, because she was completely polite while asking a valid question. I have had lunch in the actual dining room and I had a wonderful experience with a MUCH more friendly staff, so I will just stick to that instead."
46406,0,"I hate writing a bad review, but in these times of financial struggle it makes a difference where you spend your money. It matters if you don't get what you paid for, and worse if you get treated badly while getting ripped off.  This is a bit of a long review - sorry - a few things happened that need explanation. \n\nBottom line for those in a hurry - don't go to this salon unless you want to be ripped off and treated like crap!  If you want more details, keep reading.\n\nSuch is the case for me with Honeycomb. I'd heard about the salon for years and as someone sensitive to hair chemical products, this place was about my last shot for what I hoped would be a good salon with good product.\n\nMy stylist was Sarah. The bio on the website made her seem like she'd be knowledgeable and customer service oriented. I mean she worked in New York and did celebrities hair (or so it says).\n\nMy only trip there was eventful. About an hour and 1/2 into my visit, a car literally drove into the building and crashed the business next door, about 5 feet from the front door of Honeycomb. This upset and distracted the 4 of us in the salon and took up a lot of time from my visit as Sarah spent a lot of time trying to deal with the people in the accident.\n\nMy consult with her was a bit lengthy. I have some history with my hair and health, and she had a lot of questions. At one point she made a snappy comment about needing to decide what we would do and get started. No problem - hey you are the one controlling the session as the stylist so take control if you have a problem. \n\nI agreed to do one of the treatments she suggested, to help the color take better, but at the wash bowl she made her own decision not to do it. When I asked about it, she wouldn't say why.  I was there for a partial and add'l color for gray. She would not do the color w/o me doing a 24 hr skin test due to my sensitivities. Ok, I understand that but I made it clear that I needed to get the gray covered. Maybe she should have suggested I come back when we could do it all - the right way.\n\nEnd result - I walked out with my hair looking EXACTLY the same as when I walked in (like sh*t), but my wallet was MUCH lighter. \n\n3 inches of demarcation showing and all, couldn't tell I had anything done to my hair.  I got a snarky comment at the end about her being 15 min late for her next appointment. \n\nHey Sarah - you were 15 min late for MY appointment and I didn't say a word about that. What about the 30-45 min you spent dealing with the unusual car accident?  Don't blame the customer and try to make me feel bad for those things.  Plus she dropped color on me when she ran out to help the car accident people. Hey - thanks.\n\nThe biggest problem of all here is that I've spoken to Sarah since and asked her if she could fix my hair since it appears no color took. She was cold, aloof, and basically said she'd fix it for FULL price. What?? Seriously?  I've never had such a horrible reaction from a stylist or a salon in 30 years of getting my hair done professionally.  On top of this, she charged me way more than the price listed on the board for a partial or even a full highlight, but wouldn't explain why. I let it go and still tipped her 20%. When I got home and dried my hair, I realized I had essentially been ripped off. \n\nSarah also made a big deal of my long consult and said she normally charges for consults. I've have never been charged for a consult in connection with getting a service done.  Maybe this is where the 'extra' charge for my color comes from. Who knows.  Sarah was unwilling to budge and was completely unaccommodating.  NO customer service with this one.  The whole time I tried to be pleasant and understanding, but this treatment is ridiculous. I asked for the salon owner to call me to discuss further - guess what - she never called me.\n\nThis salon needs to come with a warning - they are greedy and are looking to make money w/o providing quality service. If you have a problem with a service - forget about compromise - you won't find it here. \n\nI'm making it my goal to fight this to the nth degree. I'm tired of getting ripped off. I don't make a lot of money in my job. I feel like I walked in to a salon, was robbed of $135.00 and told to get the heck out.  Please don't go to this salon if you want to be treated properly, especially for the prices they charge and the lack of quality you will receive."
29346,2,"Loved the look of this place as it was going up. The completion is fantastic from the outside. Gorgeous architecture. HOWEVER, INSIDE THE SCALE IS STERILE AND NOT HUMAN. (forgive caps) None of the shops or restaurants are for normal or even semi normal people as far as price is concerned. Even for Vegas the  prices are off the wall. See loads of people in Crystals but very few with shopping bags. This place was built in the middle of the biggest bubble in a century. It opened in the biggest bust. I predict this $8+ billion  baby will bankrupt MGM. Judging by the price I got for Aria in a few weeks occupancy is not that high. Looking at the restaujrant reviedws on YELP I'm not about to try any."
628,1,"Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said, the neighborhood is suspect.  Service was good and I liked the potato salad.  Baked beans were from the can.  Drive up was good and service was super fast."
32303,2,"Moving to a new apartment and shopping for furniture. Checked out the Rooms to Go Clearance. Large facility. \n\nLots of materials being sold at discounted prices because they are scratched, some glass table missing glass pieces, one has to really shop an look closely at the products. There are good merchandise too maybe from a floor sample or another season. If you want less flaws then definitely go to the rooms to go showrooms."
9239,3,"Friendly Donut is another favorite donut shop of locals.  A family friend has been raving about them for years and we finally took her advice. And yes, the donuts were good. \n\nIts tucked away in the corner of an old strip mall right in-between a shoe repair shop and a chiropractor. Just look for the simple DONUTS signage. You would pass them buy if you looked only at the store fronts. The interior decor was exactly what I would expect from a good donut shop...simple, a few random pictures, a Buddah statue,  bamboo plants, a advertising board for local business, and a few old tables and chairs. Don't ever judge a donut shop by their dirty tables...judge them by how many people are sitting at those tables! In the mornings, Friendly's has their regulars that will walk thru the door and the lady behind the counter already knows what to get them. On any given morning you'll see all the regular old timer HotRod builders  having donuts talking shop. And you get to check out their cool cars out front.\n\nNow on to the goods...The donuts were similar to another donut shop, I won't name drop...but it rhymes with Donalds Robots LOL! We always pick up a dozen or two of misc of donuts and just take a bite from each one...but our favorites are the maple bars. Its light and fluffy with a delicious glaze. The chocolate covered bars are also good. I'm not a big bear claw fan, but I loved it. It was a good combo of donut and the right amount of flavorful apple fillin...it was just right.. My wife loves the cinnamon roll, its pretty big fluffy donut with a nice taste of cinnamon and glaze.  My in-laws love the Bavarian cream and so does all the old timers who frequent the place. We just tried their maple covered buttermilk donuts and WOW...I think we found ourselves another favorite. We here the apple fritters are good but we haven't tried them yet.\n\nPick up your donuts in the AM (they are open 7 days a week from 4am-10pm), its fresh and you won't be disappointed. Plus you'll have a better selection. The donuts are also CHEAP...I recently picked up a dozen mixed and a dozen donut holes for under $10.00...not bad. And another tip: CASH ONLY! not to worry their are many ATM/ Banks on Boulder Hwy.\n\nFriendly's is right up there with the best of Las Vegas donut shops and it would hang with any of the LA donut shops. Shame on the people who say that Las Vegas has crappy donut shops...here's a tip- you won't find a good donut shop on the LV strip. Look with your mouth not with your eyes.\n\nAloha"
46999,0,"I will have a spicy tuna roll with a side of racism. My family and I went to Sushi Tachi a few months ago and it has taken me this long to calm the rage from the experience to write my review. \nOne evening my husband,  daughter and I went out to AYCE at Sushi Tachi. We walked in, sat down and began ordering. My daughter had brought in a Disney Princess doll to keep her occupied. Dinner went on and we were getting odd service from one of the waitresses. My husband and I simply thought she was just a naturally unhappy person and that is simply \""how her face always looked.\"" \nThe odd unhappy waitress came over at one point and asked my daughter to see her doll. The waitress said, \""that is a pretty doll, is it Cinderella? .\"" My daughter corrected her and said, \""no it is Sophia the First.\"" The waitresses response, \""oh, well she is white just like every Disney Princess.\"" She then walked away from the table. My husband and I looked at each other in shock.\nWe finally arrived at dessert. I ordered green tea ice cream and my husband ordered a tempura vanilla ice cream. When the waitress brought our order she gave me my green tea ice cream and as she placed my husband's order down she said and I quote, \""here is your vanilla, vanilla.\"" My husband a little confused asked her what she said. The odd, unhappy, smug waitress repeated, \""here is your vanilla, VANILLA!\"" \nWell, as you can imagine we will never be back."
49535,3,"I've been eyeing this place for awhile and got my chance to a few days ago. Love the concept and the friendliness of the staff. She was really patient with us since this was our first time. \n\nSo many sauces, cheeses, meats, veggies and fresh herbs. The choices makes your head spin so just take a deep breath and go for it cause it's all you want on this 11 inch pizza. Best part it's only $8.59 including taxes. \n\nThey have the dough already for you and you just pick, pick and pick. I had the tomato and buffalo sauce with meatball, sausage and some veggies. Actually I forgot what I put on it and went a little crazy. \n\nIt was a nice thin crust pizza with a nice little kick to the pizza with the buffalo sauce. The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was actually good. I was able to gobble the whole thing without stuffing myself. My daughter was able to eat her whole pizza too. \n\nNot a bad place to pick up a quick pizza. They even have salads if you like. \n\nOverall, I thought that the service was very friendly and patient, fresh ingredients, and good pizza. Love the custom made pizza without the extra charges. Nice change of pace where everyone is trying to nickel and dime you every time. I enjoyed it and will be back for sure."
36581,2,"If you choose this place, sit at the bar. Good place to watch sports. Menu finally revised and not so dark inside. Try it again if you were disappointed before."
25687,3,"Since this movie theater has been overtaken by Cineplex, there have been little changes. First off, I am glad that Cineplex offered free movie tickets in exchange of my no longer valid AMC points card and very happy that this movie theater now offers more affordable rates compared to AMC. Cheapy Tuesdays are in effect!\n\nThis theater is still the largest in the downtown core with 23 screens and features a great selection of american blockbusters to international films and independent productions. It's very roomy and comfy. Even their washrooms are better than other places because they offer paper toilet seat covers, just like in the airplane!\n\nOne thing I noticed over the past year is that they seem to be cracking down on people sneaking in to watch perhaps 2 movies in a row or going into another room. There's very little surveillance in this theater, the only person checking your ticket is right at the entrance and once you're in, you have free range. \nThis is no longer possible because they do not feature the name of the movie on the top of the room. You will only know what room your movie is playing in by seeing it on your ticket.\nScotiabank theatre does not hide which movies are playing."
19959,2,"Restaurant Week Meal #6 (Dinner for $50.13):\nAppetizer: Baby Iceberg Salad OR Australian Kobe Beef Carpaccio\nEntree: Charred Bone-In Filet Mignon\nSides: Jalape\u00f1o Creamed Corn AND Parmesan Potato Gratin\nDessert: Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar\n\nAside from the Restaurant Week menu, my friend and I decided to get the foie gras terrine since we both love foie gras and another ingredient that comes with it (Nutella!!!).  Charlie Palmer's RW menu is pretty limited and the only portion of the meal that you can choose different options was the appetizer.\n\nHudson Valley Foie Gras Terrine (regular menu):\nNutella, raspberry spaghetti, black mission figs and Texas toast. The terrine was perfectly smooth and creamy which is why it worked so well with the Nutella.  The warm Texas toast just makes the terrine smoother and creamier.  The raspberry spaghetti lacked flavor - it added color to the plate and that's about it. The figs added texture. 4/5 \n\nAustralian Kobe Beef Carpaccio:\nCame with truffle salad. The salad would've been great had it not been extra salty.  The carpaccio itself was excellent...the salad ruined it! 3/5\n\nCharred Bone-In FIlet Mignon:\nCame with bone marrow flan and Port Wine reduction.  The bone marrow flan was good. We always gets our steaks cooked medium-rare...we got rare and the thing was still mooing. I'll eat a steak as long as it's not a hockey puck but if you're a steak place shouldn't you be able to cook medium-rare? 3/5\n\nJalape\u00f1o Creamed Corn and Parmesan Potato Gratin:\nThese sides were really good. The creamed corn wasn't spicy at all for having jalape\u00f1o. The gratin was delis and the melted parmesan on top was great. 4/5\n\nChocolate Peanut Butter Bar:\nServed with caramel ice cream, and chocolate sauce. I don't like peanut butter and chocolate together but that's just a matter of personal preference. The ice cream was good and I finished it then gave the friend the half of my peanut butter.  I mean, the peanut butter wasn't too bad since it wasn't really that pronounced - I was just not in love with it to finish it. 3/5\n\nThe night we went, there was an event (some business mixer) and no hostess was there so we were quite confused. The service was quite bad. I asked first server that came to our table for the RW menu and he said he'd get it but he never came back. We were waiting for somebody to come to our table again but that took 20 minutes! Second server came to our table asking us, \""are you guys ready to order?\"" uh...it's quite difficult to place an order if we don't know what's on the menu! My patience left and ate somewhere else."
40510,1,"I went in with the expectation to find something that fit, was comfortable and didn't make my boobs look weird. Didn't find it. Everything either felt like it was cutting into my skin or the wires were too narrow or something. \n\nI felt like the salesperson was getting frustrated with me because I wouldn't settle for something that hurt or didn't fit. She said things like, \""not too bad\"" or \""you could get away with that\"". For $75 I expect it to fit correctly and I also expect to not feel pressured to settle."
23021,0,I was staying at the South Point and love Mexican food so based on reviews selected this place.  Everything about it was horrible.  The decor is cheesy diner/cafe style; there is no ambiance whatsoever.  The elderly male host was almost single handedly the most rude restaurant employee I've ever encountered.  The salsa was ok however the food in general was bland and the margaritas were watered down.  Complete waste of money and time.
29195,4,Taste of the mid west! No wonder the heartland is over weight! Lol
25261,2,"Classic drink food. Just Noodles, no frills, open late, cheap as dirt, served super quick in massive heart-stopping portions. I don't know for sure that it's MSG laden, but the hallucinations suggest that yes."
6363,0,"It amazes me that this store is still in business. I have been keeping saltwater fish and corals for 19 years and have never seen prices this high. I spoke with the owner Greg Sauers and it became crystal clear that he is out for your money. Also after speaking with an employee I was informed that the fish are not quarantined like they say and they lose a lot of fish to ick. Beware the positive reviews on Yelp and other sites as employees are also asked to give good reviews to boost up the stars. Fintastic is selling inferior livestock at a premium price. Greg told me the dry goods are so expensive because the Internet is his biggest competitor and after shipping his products will be cheaper. This is a flat out lie. He might have been able to get these prices when there was no competition in Charlotte, but that has changed. I hope this helps some people protect their tanks from crashing due to disease or poor information. STAY AWAY FROM FINTASTIC!!!"
45832,3,"Great food. Solid chips, salsa, bean dip, drinks. The entrees were good. If you like your flautas super crispy like my partner, just ask, they'll cook 'em a bit longer. Locally owned and operated and some of the best service I have had in a Mexican in Vegas."
14825,4,"I have been here twice in the last year and both times were amazing. I went with my wife both times and we requested a table with a view, and when we got there we sat right in the corner and we were able to see all the people walking the strip and the cool Wynn sign. The place is huge so it is a great place for large parties as well. If you don't want to take a lot of food home (or back to the hotel room) then just order the 1/2 orders instead and even though it still may be tons of food at least you wont be wasting it. All the drinks are wonderful and the food is great every time we come here. Sure its just like any other Maggianos as far as taste goes but its Vegas so there is a little added something. I talk to the GM of this restaurant like once a month and he is a really nice guy. The staff is great and the views are amazing. If you have not been here..go and if you have been here ...go back. \n\nPeace Out, \nMZ"
45910,2,"We went to vegas last weekend .One of my friends said that hakkasan is a very good night club ,so we wanted to check it out . the music was fine but a looooottttttt of people .I coudnt even stand in one place crowed was pushing and kicking . I didnt enjoy our time at this place. I might go there again but definately not on the weekend."
44435,1,"I've eaten at Dragon-I a few times and I have mixed reactions.  The food has generally been pretty good.  We've gotten two dishes-- beef pho and a rice stick noodle saute dish-- that have both been consistently excellent.  A glass noodle dish was not good at all and a lemongrass chicken wing appetizer was just ok.  \n\nIt's a bit annoying that they're still not serving all the dishes on the menu, including several dishes that are prominently featured in pictures in their menu and on the signs that they put up before opening.  The steamed seafood egg cup and stuffed angel wings are the most blatant offenders here, but they're also not serving any of their curry dishes or sandwiches.\n\nThe real problem, however, is the service.  The people who work at Dragon-I are, without exception, extremely nice, friendly, and seemingly hard-working.  However, it seems like most if not all of them have never worked in a restaurant before.  They really don't know what they're doing, and it shows.  They don't know the menu, don't know how to greet and seat customers, and don't know how to insure that orders are accurate and complete.\n\nI have no doubt that the people they have working there could do a really good job, but they really need to look at their management.  There's a certain level of disorganization right now, as evidenced by the page of the menu that has (in very large font) what is clearly a series of abbreviations indicating edits that should have been made to that page.  That means that someone forgot to look at the proofs.\n\nIf they improve service, this will be a solid four-stars.\n\nEdit:\nIt's been a few weeks since my review, and I'm downgrading this place to two stars.  The food is still fine, but the service is simply unacceptable.  When you make a mistake, the first thing that you should do is apologize.  That hasn't happened twice now, and it's incredibly annoying.  There are seven reviews for this restaurant and if I'm not mistaken every single one mentions some kind of service-related issues.  \n\nTo the owners of Dragon-I: If you're reading these reviews (and I wouldn't be surprised if you aren't), what you need to do is hire a competent manager ASAP.  Train your staff. Institute some actual procedures.  Make at least some attempt to actually get dishes out to a table at the same time.  I will gladly raise my review if you can raise your standards to those of any semi-competent restaurant.\n\n(One more thing: they just ordered a bunch of drink menus that say \""Dragon One.\""  Jesus Christ, guys, learn to actually look at the proofs when you order something.)\n\nEdit 2: Service has been better the last few times I've gone in.  I'll bump it back up a star.\n\nEdit 3: Virtually every time I go to Dragon-I there is something wrong with my order.  This is incredibly frustrating, since the food is pretty good.  Back down to two stars."

1128,2,"This is really one of the more disappointing BBQ places in Phx.  I hate to disrespect Honey Bears but their pulled pork is just too dry.  I shouldn't have to cover it in your bbq sauce (which isn't THAT good either) in order to make it edible.  Also, if you are going to churn out dry pork, you have got a lot of nerve charging for more bbq sauce.  I've never had anything else here but the fact that the pork isn't all that good is all I need to know.  I'll stick with Stacey's down the road."

13467,3,"Came to Mr. Lucky's one night after a LOOONG night of drinking.  A very long night.  I was ready to grub.  \n\nThe place is big and had a lot of space for seating.  I've been here many times before and overall think the food and service is good.  Tonight I got the hot pastrami sandwich for $12.  A little pricey but I expected that with being in the Hard Rock.  Black pepper pastrami, pickle chips and dijon mustard on a marbled rye bread.  I'm not partial to rye bread as I think it's a little dry, but with the mustard and juicy pastrami, it works!!  I loved how much they gave in this portion.  My tummy was doing a big dance!!\n\nIf you want to treat yourself to a good meal in the Hard Rock, check this place out.  They're 24/7!!"
33757,0,Unfortunately I got scammed into signing up for their care contract and I am so disappointed with it. EVERY single time I go in they try to upsell me something and tell me it's not covered in the pet care visits. This is the biggest mistake I have ever made. The vet techs leave my dog smelling like cigarettes after they examine them and a couple of them act as though they don't even care. Do not bring your pets here!!
24382,2,Friendly hostess who also brought our food. I think the food was okay for the price we paid but the coffee was excellent nice and strong unlike American coffee! Probably will give it another try soon.
25302,0,"What does it take for a restaurant like Elio to lose interest in their customers??? I used to be a fan of this place.  I had not visited the said address for about 2 years, and now the quality of the food, the cleanliness, even the house wine has left a very bad taste in my mouth... I ordered the pescatore pastas and I couldn't even engulf 6 bites: the shrimps (even the smaller ones) were tougher than rubber, the clams felt like they had not been rinsed, the linguini was over-cooked... both my glasses of water and wine were filthy.  No one asked me why I could not finish my meal, and were acting like they could not care less about my surprised expression at the table... I was simply stunned. And so disapointed to have lost what used to be one of my favorite italian eateries of all time.  I left bummed and hungry."
6735,2,"I live nearby this place and have had MANY bagels over the years. Over time, my standards have changed and I now get them rarely. These are not as good as a New York bagel. The texture just isn't right and the bread doesn't have the kind of flavor you get with well fermented doughs. \n\nIf you need to get something for an office with 25 people, this is a good cheap option. But for a bread fix, there are better options."
13109,3,This place was a great place to stay.  They made accommodations when we needed it and we got a tower room for a pretty good deal for two nights.  They have great customer service and the hotel was fun to gamble at.  The only cons I have at this place is the walk to the parking lot.  It is one long ass walk to the parking lot.  I swear I spent all my time doing that walk since we had to make multiples trips to and from the hotel.  Not to mention the hotel is from what I consider to be pretty far away from all the attractions of the strip.  I'm excited about the Criss Angel Cirque Du Soleil show that will start in September and will probably stay here in the future when I need a cheap place to stay
4254,1,"Wait staff is in need of training and this place generally seems confused as to what type of business they are. Front of building says \""Smokehouse and Tavern\"" which would lead many to believe that it's a restaurant with a bar. The reality is that it's a sports bar that serves food and that is exactly what I got when eating there, \""Bar Food\"". I ordered a blue cheese and bacon hamburger (over priced in my opinion). I explained to the waitress that I wanted the meat done just so it was a little pink in the middle and she said \""so we'll go with medium rare\"" , I went along with it figuring she worked there and she would know best since I explained in detail what I wanted. Result: It came out very rare and almost raw in my opinion (just barely browned on outside and all pink everywhere else), there was barely any blue cheese to taste on it and the bottom half of my bun was soaked in grease just like I would expect from a burger at a bar. \n\nMy summary: might be a good place to get a drink and watch the game, but eat at your own risk.\nP.S. I saw another reviewer compliment them on the lunch menu, I went during the dinner hour."
43134,0,"This place is a butcher shop. Arrogant, lazy staff that rushes to finish the job so they can get back to sitting or smoking out front. I know it's inexpensive but I thought you were getting the discount by compromising on ambiance, not quality. I'm 30 and it's probably been fifteen years since I had a hair experience worth crying about. Until this place got ahold of me, that is."
19638,4,"Freed's Bakery has amazing options to choose. Special occasion Cakes, Birthdays, Weddings and a lot more. The designs are amazing and they have skilled designers to create anything that you request. They also offer cookies, pastries, holiday treats, ice cream and more. They are pricey but with their perfection I  wouldn't expect nothing less. Also the staff is very kind and willing to let you sample a cookie if you are nice. Oh yeah and there known around town and the world."
39615,4,"Yeah, the butter burgers are great, but that is just the beginning. The onion rings are Fabulous! The concrete mixers have many more options that Dairy Queen, the side salads are worth a mention for the healthy alternative. They even have green beans as a side dish. OK, it is fast food, but good fast food that does not taste processed. (McDonald's and Burger King)\n\nIt is as good at is gets for taste, value and menu. There is not a more robust fast food offering that I am aware of."
8634,1,"The people working here were rude and unhappy. Not one smile in the place! The cashier lacked any personality and it was like talking to a zombie. We waited for our coffee and another guy walked up and started making the order for the person after us. Rolled his eyes when the cashier told him we were still waiting on our coffee. Then he made our order wrong... oh the sighing and eye rolling and grunting that ensued. I asked for coffee with sugar... it's not that difficult. So then I told him to just give me the coffee and I'd put my own sugar in it. Again with the sighing and eye rolling and grunting. Besides the attitude, just a smile and some eye contact would help this place a lot. FIX YOURSELVES!!! 2 stars because the coffee and doughnuts were still yummy."
11219,2,"I stopped in this Nautica store to try and land some long sleeve fitted dress shirts, but left empty-handed.\n\nI'm 6'2\"", 170 lbs. It is hard to find shirts that don't look too bulky in the middle, but are still long enough in the arms. An ideally fitted shirt for my frame is a 15-15 1/2\"" in the neck, 34/35 in the arms and trim through the midsection. \n\nNautica, it turns out, has some really nice fitted dress shirts at this store marked down, but they only carry 34/35 in the arms in a 16-16 1/2\"" in the neck size. Two of the girls there were very helpful trying to find the appropriate size, but after a quick check at the reference book, it turns out they didn't carry what I needed. \n\nThree stars for the two young ladies who made an effort to find what I needed, before they finally recommended I shop at Calvin Klein instead.\n\nTheir recommendation was heeded. Nautica, I'll sail you some other time."
29227,2,"Maybe my palate for frozen yogurt is different than most, because Mojo would not be my first choice for frozen yogurt. I constantly see people check-in at Mojo Yogurt. People seem to like the yogurt there. Tonight was my second visit to Mojo. I probably would not have gone there normally, but I met some friends that that were already at the Biltmore shopping. \n\nTonight I tried three different flavors chocolate, vanilla, and lemon icebox. The vanilla was by far the best. I am a chocoholic but the chocolate was way too sweet and over the top. By this I mean that it remind me of the time when I was a kid that I tried to drink Hershey's Chocolate Syrup out of the can. I didn't like the lemon icebox at all. Again, it was too sweet. In fact it was so sweet that it made my teeth hurt. \n\nThe service was ok, but it could be much better. There were three employees working the floor. I will call them Iman, Harry Potter, and Chrissy Snow. \n\nIman was working her butt off. She was constantly in motion cleaning tables, picking up trash, and working the register. Harry and Chrissy were socializing and watching Iman do all the work. There were only a few customers when we arrived, but that quickly changed and the store became quite busy. By the time we got to the register, Iman asked Harry for help. He is the one that weighed our yogurt and rang up our purchases. When my friend pulled out a coupon, Harry let out a loud sigh and snapped, \""You know you have to fill out the back of the coupon.\"" At this point Chrissy disappeared to the back of the store. \n\nA few minutes later I noticed that Iman was back on the register by herself, and Harry was outside chatting with a couple that I assume were his parents. The line at the register was growing longer, and you could tell customers were becoming frustrated. Iman was also visibly frustrated with Harry. She kept shooting exasperated looks at him outside. I heard Harry's mom tell him, \""She looks busy, you should go back in and help her.\""\n\nHarry continued chatting with his parents, and the line at the register became even longer. Iman looked frustrated and was working her little heart out trying to wait on customers. Finally, Harry relented when his mom again told him to go back in and help Iman. It was very obvious that Iman was doing most of the work, and that the others were just there. \n\nI know that this is just a self-serve yogurt place,  and I should not expect the same service that I would get at a sit down restaurant. However, it was a busy Friday night, and you would expect that there would be adequate service to move customers quickly through the line. There really isn't an excuse for the backed up line at the register. They had adequate coverage. It was just very obvious that not all of the employees were committed to providing the service to adequately wait on customers."

10554,2,"This is for the male strippers side (Men of Sapphire show). We got complimentary passes to come for a bachelorette party, so we thought what the heck. I had never been, so I wasn't even sure what to expect. I just didn't want any D.G (dong glitter) on me. The bartenders are really nice there, so that was a plus. Everything else can be summed up with one word: Cheesy. It was soooo cheesy, I think I lost 2lbs that night from laughing. However, I think my laughing was mistaken for having fun because one of the dancers came up really fast to my seat and was grinding his crotch in my face. I've heard that if you say get off or go away or don't touch me, they don't push, but this guy was really aggressive. And spoke in this very unsexy but sleazy italian accent 'Come on baby, don't be afraid of it\"". I wasn't afraid of it, I just dont like my men smelling like baby powder and having their crotches in my face. Anyway, he spilled his drink on me and didn't even notice. \n\nI feel kind of bad because they really gotta work it for the tips. Maybe I'm just not a strip club kinda gal. The video productions they played in the background were pretty cheesy too, looked like something you film in middle school in your backyard for a history project. But it's worth a try at least once. Other women were definitely having a good time, saw some guys getting tipped in hundreds! I'd tip them a buck or two if they passed a tip jar around. It's fun for bachelorette parties for sure, particularly if the bachelorette wants to get up on stage and molested by a muscular man dry humping her doggy style. One girl got the dude's ball pounded into her eyeballs while she was laying down onstage. I can't imagine that being comfortable, but it's a riot to watch. Thinking back on it, it's pretty funny and we all had fun."
16235,2,The portion sizes are pretty ridiculous.  I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and it was decent tasting.  But the burgers i seen others eating looked great so i was remorseful with burger envy.  I will return some day when i'm starving to see if I could possibly eat a whole burger here.
49488,0,"I went here with the hopes that this was like another sandwich shop that my friend Omar more took me to, nooope! Matter fact he came by my house other day and asked me if I liked it. I said: Nooooo! This place has too much gristle on their steak, it's like chewing on the shoe!!\nJoe says everything is fresh, mm mm mm mm mmmm \nAlthough a lot of people complained about his attitude, I didn't have a problem with his attitude. \nI did like his fries.\nSomething funny: I said I wanted whiz on my sandwich. He gave me that funny look like, no you don't! and then said it's processed. You should get the provolone. Helloooo, that's processed too!\nListen if you want great cheesesteaks... you won't find it here!"
42203,3,"Finally a boba place in the UNLV area, I live around here so 3pm cafe is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood! As I entered they were offering samples and I forget what the name of the drink was but it honesly tasted like regular milk tea. None the less, pretty standard tasting which is good. I ordered Thai Tea and orginally I thought the color was a little brighter than usual? It had a good taste and up to par with other boba places. They offer a stamp card, which is nice because I know for a fact I'll be a regular. The interior was pretty modern with clean cut lines. The tables are very school-desk like, which I loved because it shows they are really trying to cater to the students. Another major plus are the late hours! I don't have to drive all the way to a 24 hour starbucks to study past midnight since they are open till 1am on week nights. I'm really hoping they bring in a crowd like Tea Station because of their late hours. But I don't know if the east side has those type of people. I guess we'll have to see?."
28050,4,"Classy and beautiful with pretty girls, pools, and poles \n\nI'd recommend bottle service here for convenience"
22845,1,So I tried Island sushi again. Its been about  month. Unfortunately it was bad. I don't know how anyone can give this place 5 stars. You must be very easy to please. The only fish that was fresh was the salmon. that's it. I just don't eat fish I buy fish for a living. I know what I'm talking about! The ebi (shrimp) they buy that frozen and serve it right out the package. The hamachi is a frozen loin. The tuna is frozen 2+ saku block or loin CO treated. its the weekend at least order fresh for the weekend. I haven't tried there new place but I hope its better. they obviously turned there attention to the new place. Service was much better this time.
11681,4,Great food. Who cares what it looks like outside. Fish tacos were amazing. Check this place out if you want authentic Mexican.
26047,2,"The first time I had food from this place it was brought to me at home. I tasted the lasgna and almost puked, it was a very bad reaction to the sauce. We have been back several times since. I enjoy the pizza and on occasion spaghetti as well as the salads. Not having had a bad reaction to any of these other foods we continue to patronize Sabatinos."
5292,2,"Applebee's is just one of those boring chain restaurants.  I do really love some chains, but alas, Applebee's is not one of them.   Everything is just ok.  Nothing ever blows my socks off or makes me crave to come here, but it isn't bad either, just blah.\n\nI found myself here yesterday because I was outvoted by the group I was with.  Oh well, it happens.  We went for lunch and it was an ok experience.  I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger.  It was surprising yummy.  It had a lot of kick and I had a small party in my mouth.  It was better than I was expected, which was a nice surprise.  The other people in the party both got the 3 cheese penne and chicken dish.  I didn't sample it, but they both enjoyed it.  My picky eater, my 18 month old did surprise me by eating half of her grilled cheese.  She never eats anything, so that made me happy.  I tried a bite and it was quite good with the bread being a sweet, eggy bread, like brioche.  \n\nThe service was really good and we always had what we wanted without having to ask for it, which made for a pleasant meal.\n\nSo over all, the food was good, the service was great, but I am still bored with the overall place.  Give me Chili's anyday, but this Applebee's did a good job today.  Way to go Applebee's for slowing changing my opinion about you."
47272,4,"Best red curry I've had in a long time!! Seriously I am salivating just thinking of it. And if you ask for it extra spicy, oh boy will they make it hot! I love going in for their lunch special. For $7.50 you get soup, 2 wontons, an egg roll, and an entree with rice. Good prices, good service, and excellent red curry. Their orange chicken is also very good, but I can never bring myself to order anything besides the red curry because it is so freakin' good. My one complaint is they serve sweet and sour as the dipping sauce for the egg rolls when I prefer the sweet chili sauce many Thai places serve instead."
30720,1,So disappointing.  I was expecting so much but my salmon was so bland and dry that I didn't finish it.  My friend said her chicken was just on edge of being bad.  Meaning with a slightly off taste. I could make a better salad but my friend said her soup was good.  After dinner we thought we were being kind to move to the bar so our server could seat someone else at her table.  Turns out the bartender didn't take kindly to our sitting there (not busy at the bar) and suggested we should go somewhere else if we weren't going to order more wine.  After a bottle of wine at dinner and spending over $100 I think we should have been okay to sit for 30 minutes.\n\nI won't be back.
39438,4,"I would give this place 4 stars based on the food alone. I had the ribs and their texture was awesome. I'm talking cliche falling off the bone delicious. They also had a nice little subtle spice to them. I'm also a big fan of the poblano mashed potatoes.\n\nThe extra star, however, is for the owner. He came out after our meal was finished to see how our food was and spent about 10 minutes having a nice conversation with my party of 6. I'm sure he had other things he could have rushed off and done, but his personal touch really meant a lot. It's not something you see much anymore outside of ultra-high class restaurants."
32485,1,"The one nice thing I can say about the place is that the workers were pretty nice. Everything pretty much goes down hill from there. \nI ordered a gyro and I learned my lesson to never order a gyro from a place that doesn't specialize in it. (my bad)\n\nMy friend who I was with is vegan. He ordered a slice of vegan pizza. The problem was it smelled like real cheese. We asked some workers if they were sure that it was vegan and they couldn't give a straight answer. Instead they gave us another slice of vegan pizza. This time it looked completely different and there was no cheese so we thought he was pretty safe. \n\nI think the worst part of the pizza lounge is the bathrooms. Apparently, the men's  restroom is so terrible not even the male employees will use it. I didn't even feel clean after just washing my hands in the women's restroom. If it is legal to not have a restroom in your restaurant, I think they are better off just closing it down for good. \n\nGreat if you have late night munchies - terrible if you're sober."
21790,0,This place sucks.  The brother of the current owner owns LOLOs Chicken and Waffles.  Go to LoLos.  If you want to experience reverse racism as a white person go to the Golden Rule.  Complete ahole is running his mother's landmark into the ground.
12205,4,"The Henry Vilas Zoo is a not so hidden gem in Madison.  It's a smaller zoo, but with a great variety of animals.  It's easy to navigate and you are able to see everything is a fairly short period of time, which could be considered good or bad...for our family, it's good! ;)  They offer train rides and carousel rides for $1.50 per person, regardless of age. I think the carousel is worth it...the train, not so much. The train basically goes in a very short loop where you just see the backs of some buildings that you could just as easily walk around. There is a petting zoo and a giant play structure that is fun for older kids. \n\nThe biggest downfall of the zoo is the lack of parking.  If you are lucky, you will get a spot in the lot, but on busy weekends we've had to park multiple blocks away. I can forgive this little flaw since the zoo itself is FREE.  If you've got a little change to spare, be sure to throw it in the donation buckets located around the zoo. This year on a trip in July we were told they were already out of maps for the year - and there was no budget to print more. \n\nFinally, be aware that when they say the zoo closes at 5:00, they really mean 4. The petting zoo, the park, and all exhibits with doors are closed at 4.  They just leave the actual zoo open for another hour while they filter people out.  Don't go at 3:30 and think you will have a full hour and a half to explore or you will be disappointed."
39197,1,"I have mixed feelings about this Service Center.  Mostly because I only go here when it is necessary (usually when I've missed 3 delivery attempts).  This is WAY across town for me and you have to time it so that you don't get stuck in 485 rush hour traffic.\n\nI wish there was a more \""central\"" location in Charlotte.  I would hate to live in the Huntersville or University Area and have to go down here to pick up a package.\n\nAs far as the service goes, the people were pleasant.. I was in a bit of a rush since I decided to give up my lunch break to drive 30min down 85 to 77 to Westinghouse Blvd...  and yes, I work up in the University Area so it was about an hour round trip.\n\nThere was an elderly lady that totally jumped the line in front of me and was on her cell phone trying to get the right zip code for Japan - OBNOXIOUS... totally tainted my trip, but at least I got to leave before her.  In the parking lot, I gave her a long \""western movie\"" stare and drove off.  She was probably oblivious, but in my mind I made my point."
14865,1,"I haven't written a bad review, but I feel that this would really benefit future customers. This particular location is always so crowded, which contributes to the long wait for a table and their slow service. There is also an awful smell that fills the restaurant at least that is what I experienced when I was there. \n\nAnyway after a long wait, our server had finally noticed us and took our order. I had ordered the steak tips and a side of pancakes. It took a while for our food to come and after getting my food I realized that my pancakes were never delivered. I told another server because our server was not around. The lady said she was sorry and that it would be out, but still no pancakes. I had to tell someone else that I didn't receive my pancakes. That server forgot as well. After being halfway through my meal I just didn't want to bother having my pancakes anymore so I just asked them not to charge me for it. \n\nYou would thing they would have given me a free meal or something but they just took off $3. It was such a disappointing experience. The food is good, but their customer service needs improvement."
18295,4,"Went to Ventanos because a friend recommended it and we loved it! The wine was excellent, the bread had a good flavor, the food was delicious, and the view was amazing! I can't remember our server's name but he was terrific. No complaints on this place. The decor and ambiance was warm and inviting and my date loved the place too."
35568,4,"My friend hired Cuteology Cakes to do dessert tiers  for my recent baby shower.  They were absolutely adorable and delicious!  Not only were they presented beautifully, they tasted yummy.

47948,4,"Wanted to do something different tonight and went to Red Mansion.  The last time we went was a couple of months ago and had a great time.  This time it was even better.  We started with the Shrimp and achieve Dumplings.  These are fresh made (not from the freezer).  They were the size of a golf ball.  Very full of flavor and fresh.  For entrees we had the Sichaun Fish with Spicy Garlic Sauce and Peppered Beef with Asparagus.  The Sichaun Fish was amazing.  Never had a fish dish like this before.  Very delicate fish perfectly cooked with a medium spice garlic oil sauce.  The Peppered Beef was a great compliment with the fish.  The beef is very tender and nice crispy asparagus.  After a couple of dinners at Red Mansion, I have to say it is the best Chinese food in town and beats anything in Chinatown."
9162,2,"tonite had first bad meal here. was with 90 yr old motherinlaw so did not say anything cuz she gets so flustered and thinks anything untoward is her fault somehow. been here plenty and usually very good food across the board. beware the chicken fried steak if the breading could not save it there is a problem, and there was an overabundance of breading on a stringy unchewable hunk of steak. just pushed it around and hid it under gravy so mom didn't notice. little blip hopefully just one bad day and not a sign of things to come, cuz dillon's is a family favorite."
35899,4,"My finance and I have visited Las Vegas several times over the past couple years and decided that on this trip we would finally go see the Grand Canyon.  Our initial plan was to get a rental car for the day and drive ourselves.  That was before we realized truly how far away the canyon was from Vegas and how many additional fees there would be along the way ($25 entry fee per vehicle into the park at the Canyon). \n\nI did a search online for \""best Grand Canyon tour\"" and Grand-Adventures came back as a 5-star Trip Advisor company.  We debated booking a cheaper tour in the $100 per person range but decided that the extra money would probably be worth it.  The website is loaded with information about how you should expect your day to go. \n\nWe couldn't have been more satisfied with our decision to spend the extra money.  True to their word, there were zero additional fees we ended up paying for anything on the tour, our guide (Eric) was excellent, the van is as comfy as a van can get, and we followed the itinerary the website set out as expected.  \n\nWe didn't expect periodic history \""lessons\"" from Eric as we were driving down different sections of the road to the Canyon (he did mention it's not required, so other drivers may not do this), and he gave us information with such enthusiasm and joy that it was hard not to be completely into history (and I am normally not into history at all).  Eric took countless photos of everyone in our group that wanted pictures and was so patient in that regard.  Our lunch was delicious and everything was right on time and as expected.  \n\nOur group size was 9 people - they limit it to 10 - and despite the fact that we were the only two U.S. born people on the tour, it was still fun!  Eric found a way to connect with everyone and kept us engaged in conversation throughout that lengthy van ride to the Canyon.  The walking tour was beautiful, the Canyon was more amazing than expected, and we genuinely had a better time than we imagined we would have.  I'll be recommending this company for a long time to come."
10188,2,"I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good at...CANALETTO! - Kid Cudi (pursuit of happiness)\n\nLocated in what feels like the heart of the Venetian near the canals, the location could not be any better. We were seated on the outside part of the restaurant so we could watch the performances going on every 15 minutes or so it seemed like. In the middle of the meal there was a performance lady in one of the fake balcony's above the restaurant that started singing opera, which was kind of weird and oddly cool at the same time. \n\nWe started off with the 'tempura' vegetables and it was really good actually. Yes this place is italian so technically they are fried vegetables but it reminded me of vegetable tempura! Anyways, some good variety including eggplant, asparagus, and the best one of them all: the artichokes. I would've been happy with a full plate of these fried artichokes as they were super tasty and light. For the main course, I had the seafood pasta with tomato sauce. Wow the pasta was definitely al dente, it was really well done although the seafood components weren't special. I couldn't even tell if they were fresh seafood or not; I think the pasta stood out more than the seafood and that's not a good thing. Service could've been better as well, food took much longer than expected and drinks took a while.\n\nFood: 3 stars --- Service: 3 stars --- Atmosphere: 4 stars --- Price(value): n/a"
42923,2,BEAUTIFUL cupcakes with a mediocre taste. The frosting of my cupcakes were heavy on butter and left a film in my mouth. The cake was on the drier side and lacked flavor. I'm not sure id be back.
37558,4,"This hidden gem is my new favorite breakfast spot! The staff is SO friendly, and their menu has the right balance of unique choices along with the classics. They make everything from scratch and try to use organic ingredients whenever they can.

Once in a while they'll get someone who has their shit together and can run things efficiently. Unfortunately much like a progressive priest at my old Catholic School, they never last.\n\nLack of sufficient pre-planning is also apparent because one of the drawbacks of coming in after lunch time is that it's not unusual for them to be out of your preferred kind of bread (usually wheat) If the staff are busy chit-chatting in the back room you may have to wait until someone ventures out to find you waiting (wonder how many bags of chips have been lifted). \n\nIf you work downtown you don't have a lot of options so all there is to do is deal with it. It's not God awful but it can be ghetto and I would LOVE to see the collective rap sheet of my local sandwich artists."

45789,1,"The checkin person was great but besides that this hotel sucked. No ventilation, as the smoke just hit you every time you left the room. Then they nicked every cent they could from you for items that are usually free in most places. Not recommended."
31806,3,"What a unique place to visit!  Alittle touristy, but alot of great spots for photo ops.  There is not much, but the name was so interesting that we had to check it out!"
4595,0,"Yikes,  the memories of DQ.  You know, ice cream, treats, a nice nostalgic feeling of the past for kids.  What happened to this place?  I haven't a clue.\n\n1.  Ambiance - Been here several times now, and always the same, bland, not exciting.\n\n2.  Service - Hmmm, perhaps they should turn this one to a self service facility, this would definitely improve the service. A guy was there waiting for his kids sundae. The servers assisted and prepared orders for two other customers that came in after. The guy goes to the server to remind them, they said it was almost ready. Then I put my order in, the guy starts to make mine and I remind him about the guy's kid from three orders ago. So, they start to make it and it takes like 10 seconds. Poor kid.\n\n3.  Service Part 2 - they make my order and the shakes are like slightly thicker than milk. I said no whip and guess what, whip. I ordered one dipped cone and guess what, i got two. I guess you can say that this ying yang approach is balanced???\n\n4.  Air Con - What the heck happened here? No air, no fans, hot and stuffy?  Hmmm, what would a normal store do? Offer free dipped cones!\n\n5.  Service Part 3 - to use the toilets, you have to get a key from the cashier. Guess what, they cannot find the key.  I wonder what the dealio is since this place is usually empty anyway, no need to manager the bathroom.\n\nThis is not a bad place, the cones and stuff are decent, but the service and customer care is not in existence."

29342,1,"I have to say St Rose Pediactrics is wearing super thin on me. Appointment time was 11:00am. 45 minutes after we are put in a room. 25 minutes later a doctor still has not come in. It's about time to scale back the number of clients and/or appointments you take. Look, I've even had enough time to write this review AFTER reading all the others."
43016,0,"Alright, I gave this place 2 visits.  Not one to write many reviews, but had to say something.  While the kiddos love the frozen yogurt, this place is just plain BAD.  I can't get over just how filthy this place is.  From fingerprints on the lighted pictures/posters and glass door, to completely gross seating (spilled frozen yogurt, fingerprints, damaged seats), not enough seating, to paint peeling off the walls, overflowing trash cans outside with empty yogurt containers, my wife and felt like we needed to take a shower after we left.  The floor seems dirty all the time - maybe the choice of material?  The staff is just not attentive, often talking privately behind the counter, in front of people.  They often disappear in the back, and when it's time to check out, with the line running long and the frozen yogurt melting the cup, they just stand behind the counter, unwilling to help.  The attire was, shall we say, 'varied'.   I never knew they gave out freebies until a mother asked a couple times that they wanted a sample before diving in, and then the staff hovered over them while they tried it.  It seriously feels like someone bought the place and decided to not manage it, and the 16 year olds working there are in charge.  To boot, with not much going on except eating, I was hopeful for wi-fi to check on a few things - nope... not available.  \n\nFull disclosure:  I work in customer service, and image, cleanliness, and friendly staff are high on my list.  This is the antithesis of a great establishment.  My wife kept commenting how depressing the place was.  I agree, and we won't be going back.\n\nBarbara G posted a similar review to this about a week ago, so I see I'm not the only one.  It just stumps me that such a new place could be run so poorly.  Definitely avoid."
48751,4,"My husband and I were eating this food back when it was just Pittsburgh Willy's at the antique market! We love it! The food is simple, often something we coI'll and would make at home, but that is why it is good. It is home cooking that you don't have to make yourself! I was pleasantly surprised this morning when I found out that they have a breakfast menu!  I had the fried bologna sandwich, which was made with a thick slab! It was very good. My husband had a cheesy mess of breakfast tasty! And these were big plates of food!\n\nAbout the service. The food comes out much faster now-a-days, which is probably because they have a bigger area to work in, and I am so excited for them! The food is hot and fresh. The owner, Randy, is the first face I have always seen, even back at the antique market, and he seems so stoked to have customers. Such a good atmosphere at this legitimate mom'n'pop shop.\n\nCheck them out!"
33900,0,Absolutely horrible! !! Waited 3 hours to see the doctor. The reception is ghetto and needs to find another job. No respect for their patients.  They make you wait 3 hours to see the doctor. Don't go!! Didn't want to pick a star but you have too.
18198,3,"I recently found this store by accident......I had seen it online but I don't like buying clothes online for many reasons. This store is fantastic because it is very affordable and has soooo many accessories to match just about any outfit you buy there. They have many beautiful blouses, shorts and other great summer clothes for this extreme heat right now. The costume jewelry is fun too...may not be high quality but with the way I like to change my wadrobe and accessories I don't want to spend a fortune anyway! There are some things like jeans that I don't believe you can skimp on and buy inexpensively but all else is fine!"
4832,2,"24/7 Local video poker sports bar, everything you'd expect. It seems like I'm always just stopping in for a cheap breakfast, the Pt's Platter is way better than its Ihop and Denny's counterparts and the waitresses are much friendlier. Unfortunately, I always get sucked into the video poker machines and end up leaving with a full tummy and an empty wallet."

18141,1,we got a room in the octavius tower.  it smelled of the drain in the shower.  we suffered through the first night because we arrived at 2 a.m.  and were too tired to complain and wait for another room.  the 2nd morning we called front desk to request for another room but we did not get one until almost 5 p.m.!  the 2nd room smelled better. but both rooms' showers were very weak.
4603,3,"My boyfriend and I were torn on where to go for a bite to eat and have a casual nite out.... and we decided Buffalo Wild Wings- this was a great choice! We had a fun time! We sat at the bar and Jason was our bartender/waiter, he was great! We had great conversation, and then my boyfriend and I were able to play the silly trivia game they have and enjoy some good competition. The food was good, but chicken wings are their specialty here- so they know how to make them!"
36222,2,"I really enjoyed stopping here on this rainy morning with a friend.  The chairs/loveseat by the fire place were nice. (would have been nicer lit, but we didnt ask..they probably would have turned it on if we had asked).  The coffee was good. I had the special \""lucky irishman\"" which was perfect.  My friend had a plain latte and enjoyed it.  \nThe ONLY downfall for this place is the espresso machine sounds like the mothership is landing right on top of us.  It was so loud my friend sitting two feet from me speaking louder than average was not audible at all. \nOther than this small but important detail: a very very nice place to enjoy good coffee!"
21643,1,"This was a tough review for me.  I wanted to give them higher marks, really I did.\n\nI went in with low expectations.  I've had Jewish food on the east coast, OK?  Things were looking good right off the bat.  We were seated and water and a tray of pickles appeared as our tushes hit the cushions.  My lovely wife picked up a pickle, crunched off a bite, gave a surprised expression and said, \""Not bad.  I'll be the Jew-judge.\""  She is Jewish, after all.  Fair enough.  I thought the pickle was pretty good, comparable to some I've had on the east coast.\n\nThat's where things started to go awry.  It took between 5-10 minutes before anyone came over to get a drink order.  We ordered several items to share.  My wife and I shared a corned beef sandwich and fries with gravy.  The kids shared matzo ball soup, blintzes and a latka.  I ordered coffee.\n\nThe soup came first and it was very good and authentic.  Coffee?  \""Oh, right.\""  My water has been sitting empty for a bit.  The rest of the food arrived pretty quickly, and my coffee arrived.  Water?  \""Oh, right.\""\n\nThe blintzes were very good, especially the cheese.  The corned beef was good, it passed muster as authentic.  Fries?  Good.  Brown gravy?  Fine, but it had an odd flavor.  Latka?  Very good.  Water?  \""Oh, right.\""\n\n\""Can I get a refill on the coffee?\""  \""Oh, right.\""\n\nThe prices are high.  The sandwiches are available whole or 1/2.  $13.xx for a whole corned beef is a bit high, but it is big enough to share so that's a plus.  One sandwich and one order of fries was enough for 2 adults.   The fries were $4.xx  \n\nCoffee?  \""Oh, right.\""  I don't appreciate having to ask for every refill 3 times.  I would probably write it off to just one server having an off day or something. \n\nIn summary:  Good kosher-style food, a bit pricey.  It will hit the spot when I'm craving a corned beef sandwich.  The service was spotty.  So what may have been a 4 star review has been knocked all the way down to 3 stars.  \n\nCoffee?"

44976,4,"A truly 5 star dental office!  \n\nI am within walking distance to Dr. Hill's office and I'm so happy that this is the closest dentist to me! The office is spotless. The staff is so friendly. I was offered a water while I waited. \n\nMaybe I just hadn't been to a dentist in a while but I was in awe over the xray machine that rotates around your head! It really cuts down on the amount of images they have to take with those plates in your mouth. Very high tech. Each chair has a television for patients to watch while they go through their cleaning, drilling, etc. The chairs are way more modern than the dental chairs from days of old and very comfortable... \n\nMorgan is my dental hygienist and she's super sweet. Makes me feel totally comfortable. \n\nI've met Dr. Hill twice for a short while (so far I haven't needed dental work besides cleanings, which are done by the hygienist) but he seems very nice. \n\nI love their appointment reminders (I received a call about 2 weeks prior since I made the appointment 6 months in advance, and then receive an email and text closer to the scheduled date. \n\nThis is such a professional dental office with great staff... I'm a lifer!"
39575,4,"Fantastic meal, great decor, and excellent drinks - need I say more?.?.?  Ok here goes.  The Caeser Salad had Pig Ear, Pickled Okra, and a Fried Egg that gooed out to make a warm compliment to the light dressing... Fantastic.  The mussels had bacon, salmon roe, and fennel... What how do those thing go together, extremely well that's how.  Hangar steak had some nice bitter micro greens, uber crispy potatoes, and a nice bright sauce to pull it all together... Drinks were unique, especially my barrel aged Buffalo Trace Manhattan.  Booooom.  If you are in Pitt, go here... the end."
20326,1,"I'm a Chicago native living in Vegas for a while now and I get the usual cravings for Chicago food.\n\nI was in the mood for hot dogs tonight so I decided to try Tasty Dogs for the first time. \n\nI've read the other reviews here and I really wanted this place to be great, but unfortunately it didn't live up to them.\n\nAlthough they had all the right ingredients, Vienna beef dogs, neon green relish, poppy seed buns, sport peppers, etc, the final dogs served to me were pretty sub par.\n\nFirst- one of the buns had a stale end- like the end was hanging out of the package and dried up. How do you serve a customer a rock hard bun? Next they really skimp on the toppings, Two TINY slices of tomato (seriously looked like they sliced a cherry tomato as thin as possible. A pickle spear on the dog looked like it was shaved off the pickle with a vegetable peeler. Then just a bare minimum of the other toppings covered the dog.\n\nI understand this stuff is mostly all shipped in from Chicago and it's expensive, but I'm paying a premium- the 2 dog special is $8.99 + tax!!! For that kind of money, give me a decent topped dog on a fresh bun! I felt pretty gypped.\n\nThe one good thing I can mention are the hand cut thin fries- very tasty.\n\nI may go back and try the gyros and Italian beef and hope it gets made with a little more care. Maybe I just had an unusual bad experience."
24287,4,"Great library I love going here and my kids love it even more. I love the children's area we visit the library at least once a week and this is where we spend most of our time. The children's area is great it has computers for the kids to use. It has many sections of books for kids for all ages from babies to grade school n Jr high as well as parenting books. They have a great little play area which offers plenty different toys for the kids to play with and its also equipped with many comfortable little couches. They offer story times for kids of all ages. They have crafts, plays and movies on different dates. As well as coloring pages available anytime. They have many programs to encourage kids to read. As well as reading programs for kids, my kids love going to the library and it encourages them to read more. I love how all the sections are in different areas. For children, teens and adults. I love there small art gallery it mat be small but it is nice. Overall this is a great library. I love going here and love taking my kids here even more."
47561,3,"I have been  to a lot of spas. Some fancy and others fancy only in their eyes. I was recommended this location from my resort The Scottsdale Villa Mirage. A friend and I went one day and I had a massage and I came back the next day for a facial. First off the prices are freakin awesome. I'm from Chicago and for those prices, trust that the building and the products would not be that great. The location is small, but neat, decorated very well and the staff is great. I honestly felt like I was in a much higher quality establishment. I wish I could bring them home with me."
5489,4,"The sushi here is SO good. My favorites include the Japanese lasagna and the vegetable fried rice.  The miso soup is also yummy.  Happy hour here is pretty good too, and if you do check in through yelp, you get a free bottle of sake (i have not cashed that in yet). \nThey used to have real scallops for their happy hour fried scallop dish, but last night when i was there, it was imitation scallops.....almost tasted like imitation crab meat, only rolled into a scallop shape.  Perhaps an oversight, perhaps a permanent change? Who knows....\n\nThe service is friendly, and really accommodating, and i will be back numerous times in the future"
10912,1,"We came as a party of four without a reservation. We had about a twenty minute wait, no big deal so we sat at the bar. I Decided on a mojito that was great. Cheers to the bartender. \n\nWe were sat at our table in the outdoor dining area. There was live music playing below our seating area that was great. This was the end of our positive experiences here.\n\nThe service was lackluster, not terrible, just nothing special. Any drinks ordered seemed to take some time before coming to the table. Everyone ordered a different meal from the menu. \n\nThe food was nothing to write home about. Our appetizers came out timely, some melted cheese & chips. Then came entr\u00e9e. It was $30 for three small tacos that were not very impressive. Finally, the desert. A very bland banana cream pie. \n\nI'd give this place another shot. There were some other choices on the menu I'd like to try some time."

33863,3,"We have had lunch here several times, but today, it finally dawned on me that I haven't yelped about this place.  It's legit.  The salsa has a little heat to it, which I like.  Also, the guacamole had a lot of additional ingredients:  peppers, onion, tomato, radishes, etc.  It was fantastic as well.\n\nFor lunch, I had the wagyu fajitas.  These were EXCELLENT and for $20 you get quite a lot of food.  The steak is heavily - but not overly so - seasoned, as are the accompanying onions and peppers.  You also get rice and beans, it's more than enough to make 3 good sized fajitas.  We also had the shrimp tacos, which are a staple for us at Mundo.  3 tacos in smaller size tortillas, they fill them to the brim, to the point you will probably have to resort to a fork at times.  They are crispy and flavorful, which is why one of us typically gets them.\n\nToday, we shared the street corn, which is taken off the cob and mixed with cojita cheese, crema, and spices.  It was excellent, better than many creamed corn dishes I've had at fancy steakhouses.  This side dish is a must, the corn is firm and retains a lot of its crunch.  The cheese is noticeable, and the spices add flavor without overwhelming.  Can't believe I haven't eaten this before.\n\nAlso, none of our drinks got close to empty.  Excellent service throughout.  Highly recommend Mundo."
6301,1,"I really, really want to like The Diamond. It's cheap, convenient to my house, and my friends like it. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I'm just not even impressed enough to want to go without being decently drunk first. The first two times I went, I got breakfast food. Breakfast is kind of why I go to diners, I love it. Unfortunately, the Diamond can't manage cooking scrambled eggs. They came out rubbery and overdone both times. \n\nMy friends agreed that their breakfast is terrible and said I just had to try their lunch/dinner menu instead. Well, I gave it a shot with one of their signature sandwiches, a pork burger with onions, bacon, and cheddar. Three bone shards later, I decided I couldn't finish my pork burger and moved on to the sweet potato fries I had paid an upcharge to get. Mushy. My friend's regular fries tasted great, but they didn't get the sweet potato ones right. \n\nThe $20-for-2 dinner bill would have been a consolation if only the service had been quick enough to bring us our bill and the extra meal we had ordered. Unfortunately, just like some of our party's drinks and silverware, the server had forgotten and we had to wait another 15 minutes while they hustled it out of the kitchen. Meh."
41647,4,"This is my new favorite dim sum place in Las Vegas. First experience, went with my parents. The wait for a table was maybe 10 minutes as I went during prime time for lunch (around 12pm). After I was seated at my table, I ordered the usual things you'd usually get when you go dim sum. Siu Mai, Steamed chicken feet , and sticky rice wrapped w/ lotus leaves. Very fresh, flavored well, and steaming hot ! When even I say hot, its HOT. \n\nThe chicken feet were flavored well. Not over seasoned, though tendons still a little chewy (could have used a few more minutes in the steamer) but still pretty well done. \n\nThe pork siu mai was topped with some masago (capelin roe). Steaming hot. Flavor was good. The pork was \""chewy\"", not in a bad sense but it has a slight resistance that shows it was made properly. There is a fairly decent size shrimp piece in there as well, that was not over cooked. \n\nThe sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was nice. Wrapped normally with a few lotus leaves. Did not fall apart as i was taking the leaves off. Flavored well, good amount of ingredients inside the sticky rice. \n\nAfter a few other items were ordered, ranging from a few different buns, shrimp rice noodle, pan fried chives dumpling, and egg tarts. \n\nThere were two types of buns i had ordered. One was called (directly translated) leaking sand bun which was made with i believe a salted egg yolk mixture which when you pull apart the bun, the rich, egg yolk mixture oozes out. perfectly made. that's the result you'd look for when you get this bun. hot from the oven, before the bun itself soaks up this yolk mixture. very delicious. \n\nthe other bun (directly translated) is called the snow mountain bun. Has a white crust on top with i believe a lotus filling. Very good. Nice and hot off the cart. \n\nThe shrimp rice noodle was well-made also. Good thickness to the noodle and a good sized shrimp lined in the middle of the noodle, topped with a soy sauce that was prepared to be slightly sweet. \n\nThe pan fried chives dumping is one of my favorite items to get. Parts of the outer skin layer crispy due to the pan fried technique while the size is still nice and soft. The filling had ample amounts of Chinese chives, shrimp, and pork. Seasoned really well, not overpowering the natural tastes of the chives or meats. \n\nLast but not least, is the egg tarts.. Fresh out of the oven, nice flaky golden crust with a glimmering, shiny egg filling in the middle. The crust was warm and flaky but still unable to taste the butter? they use to create the flaky crust mixed with a bite of the the slightly sweet egg center. One of the many favorite dim sum items or snack items among the chinese communities. \n\nUnfortunately this was my first meal, so I didnt get to order much before I was stuffed. I will not hesitate to come back again for another round of dim sum. \n\nA little suggestion, try going with 4-6 people in your party if you want to try a good amount of the dishes they offer during lunch. Lunch is served between 10 AM and 3 PM. Don't hesitate to go early or late ! They will specially prepare the item of your choice even if you don't see it available on the cart. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable, especially considering this restaurants sits inside the Rio Casino & Resort. The prices are as followed:\n\nSmall: $2.28\nMedium: $3.18\nLarge: $3.98\nSpecial: $4.98\n\n*edit*\n\nI went again recently. One thing to note was the service was quite lacking. Forgotten orders or took a while to serve us."
20878,3,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. This was the finisher of our Vegas trip on our way back to Los Angeles. Our friend suggested this place since we enjoyed the boiling crab in K-Town. It was not a disappointment. The wait was not bad, it was about 20 minutes. Once we were seated we placed out order for four pounds of shrimp and 2 pounds of craw-fish. We stuck to the mild and medium. Great kick.. The craw-fish and shrimp were huge, both in flavor and size. \n\nEverything about this place was great. The servers busted their buts to make sure that our table was clean and that we were served. They took good care of us. \n\nIf you live in Las Vegas, or passing through after a few slots, this is the place to go. Your hands are the forks and knife and the table is your plate. Dive in and enjoy!"
16388,2,"Not a bad joint.  Every time we go into the one at WestGate, it appears empty.\n\nFood is great.  Beer is great.  Menu is diverse."
41400,2,I dont know why I've never noticed it before but I actually hate their greeting as I walk in. The last thing I want to hear is a bunch of impersonal HI'S!!! or HELLO!!! as I walk in from about 10 different people.  I really don't like eating inside this specific location as it seems much louder than others I've been to in the past. I usually get my sandwhich then head next door to Five Guys and just buy a drink so I can sit and enjoy my meal in quiet. \n\nThat being said I simply love their subs. Their mayo is the best hands down and pretty much makes the sandwhich. I looked up their nutritional value online and unfortunately at 700 calories per sub it wasn't looking too great as a healthy alternative to the surrounding fast food places. Still if I'm craving a sandwhich I'd prefer Jimmy Johns over other sub sandwhich places. Subway *cough*
9364,4,"It's been said already:\n\nThese are the best tamales you will ever taste.\n\nDona Maria's been hanging around downtown since 1980 on the corner of Charleston and Las Vegas Boulevard.  It's not the most visited of areas, especially for dining, and Dona Maria's has been here and packed for almost 30 years.  They recently opened another restaurant in Summerlin so you won't have to drive your nice car downtown (wasn't that sweet?)  The reason why it's done so well are the tamales.  They are out of this world.  They come in pork, chicken and cheese with expertly crafted sauces.  The rest of the menu is great as well - just good Mexican food - but really, people come here for the tamales."
39603,0,"I have tried this place twice.  It is very popular, always crowded, and has a nice ambiance.  That being said, plain and simple- the food is bad.  The chicken marsala was the worst I have ever eaten and at $16, was not a good value.  I probably should have sent it back.  While their pizza is OK, at $12-15, I would rather go to a number of other places that are far superior such as Sauce, Fired Pizza, Pizza Me, Crust, or Grimaldi's.  It is always a puzzle to me why places that often have such mediocre food and prices can be so popular, but I would imagine it has to do mostly with the atmosphere."
37288,3,"I was so excited to go to Inglot because it's comparable to MAC cosmetics. The employees at this store were very helpful. Oscar was the one assisting me. I was planning to get the Freedom System Palette but most of the matte colors were \""sold out.\"" He informed me that they received a new shipment but didn't open the boxes yet. He was nice enough to show me the colors that were sold out. I was able to swatch the colors and took a note of the numbers I liked.\n\nI love the eye shadows because they are half the price of MAC eye shadows & bigger. It has the same quality & still very pigmented. Oscar told me that there's an Inglot in Macy's at San Francisco, so I will definitely visit that store.\n\nThe only thing I'm disappointed is their return & exchange policy. I asked Oscar if I'm able to order the Freedom System eye shadows & if I was unsatisfied, would I be able to return or exchange it? Oscar said, unfortunately that's a set back for Inglot. Compared to MAC cosmetics you can return or exchange any product if you're unsatisfied with it. With the Freedom System products, there are no returns or exchanges. I guess I'll be swatching the colors first in SF before placing an order online."

7346,3,"Food is very good, the owners are very friendly.  I would have given them a 5-star however it typically takes 10-20 minutes to get your food (and this is simple mexican food), secondly they don't have free chips & salsa.  Their Texax Burrito and the Al Pastor plate are both very good."
37975,3,"This along with XS are my favorite clubs in Las Vegas. I would give this place five stars if it wasn't for the funky layout. Right when you enter you have to walk up this flight of stairs that will make you tired if you aren't moderately fit. \n\nThe cool thing is that there are several floors that play different music, and a pool room that is more of a lounge area to chill. More rooms means easier to find people as long as your have reception. When this place gets crowded though, get ready to fight through people since most of the floor space is not open grounds where you can just squeeze through people. \n\nGuys...be smart and buy your pre-sale. I know, I know...you're a cool guy with LOTS of girlfriends and you get in free to clubs ALL THE TIME...stop being an idiot and just buy a pre-sale. Now you don't have to be at the whim of the females and you can pretty much just walk into the club since the pre-sale line is pretty short. Also, the tickets are cheaper."
15735,2,"we made a reservation for 12 for a bachelorette party... and they sat us in a private room by the wine display, which was very nice. our waiter was very funny, polite and entertaining... best waiter i've ever had probably. :)\n\nthe only thing i didnt like... was the food. which would be the major thing. i would not come here again to a large sum on ok food... it was probably what i had tho, i had t a soup and salad since nothing else appealed to me. i dont eat steak and am not fond of big chunks of chicken... or lobster... so i guess i am bias. \n\nthe atmosphere was nice, but not something id want to do again."
44765,0,"Yes, this place is fast, but the front desk staff suck at customer service. The most unfriendly girls full of attitude. I will not come to this location ever again."
7194,2,I wouldn't advise any health nut go here but if you want some cheap super yummy HUGE taco's with frybread wrappers?   Hit it up!\n\nThe ladies working were really nice and the price was pretty fair.\n\nI felt like a peace pipe afterwards... no really... okay no I didn't but it was really good.

48225,3,"Closest I've found to NJ/NY bagels in Charlotte area.. Bagels are pretty great, had a sausage egg and cheese and it was delicious.  A little neater (fluffy scrambled egg) and less greasy than a true Brooklyn bagel,but that's really not a complaint and I guess that's the Charlotte touch ."

49119,1,"Last Saturday we had lunch here and it was just OK!  Now I can say I have been there!!!!! \nThe only reason I give it two stars is because our waitress was great!  \nYou have to order exactly what is on the menu... We asked for onion rings instead of fries and they said \""NO\"".  You have to pay $14 for onion rings no substitutions!  I tasted my friends burger with blue cheese and I have never had something more disgusting than that!!!  I tasted the burger with the pastrami and the description on the menu was better than the burger!  I had the chili with corn bread... Marie Callender's is better for half the price.  \nThe food looks great but the taste is not worth the money nor the million calories that Guy's food packs! \nThere are thousands of places in Las Vegans that are much  better than this place!   Have a drink, enjoy the experience and eat somewhere else!"
20846,0,"I decided to make a last minute trip to LV to join my family celebrating a birthday.  They were staying at the Bellagio for four nights.  I was only going to stay for two nights, and by the time I had decided to go the Bellagio rates were higher than I wanted to pay for given the quick stay over.  Since Planet Hollywood was just across the street from the Bellagio, and the rate seemed reasonable, I decided to stay there.\nI won't say that it was a horrible experience, but I was definitely disappointed.  The rooms are dated and didn't feel exceptionally clean.  The decor has a 1990's vibe to it.  I'm not sure how much of it is carryover from the Aladdin revamp prior, but it wasn't up to what I would consider \""current Strip standards\"".  It seems appropriate that this is Britney Spears anchor arena for her shows - it has a slightly \""trashy\"" feel to it. \nSome of the issues that I had regarding the room were:\n- missing front of one of the drawers\n- strange odor from the faucet water in sink\n- pull chain shades that kept sticking\nI can see being in my 20's and coming here to have a raging time, but those days are a little bit behind me at this point and would rather opt for comfort and modern amenities (like at Aria) than \""just a place to crash\"" at the end of a long night."
8062,4,"This place is gooood. The food seems fresher than most indian food places, and it definitely doesn't taste like it's been sitting out all day. That might actually be a complaint. I'm so used to eating vegetable pakoras that have been sitting in a vat under a heat lamp that these were too fresh for me to like. You know? It's like being raised on Taco Bell and being so used to that as your definition of Mexican food that when you actually go to a Mexican food joint with fresh ingredients you're like, \""WTF is this?\""\n\nOh yeah, and it's definitely more expensive than other places in the valley."
32798,1,"I usually like this place for a quick cookie fix, but this last visit really frustrated me. I have a \""don't yelp when angry\"" rule so I'm yelping this almost a week later. \n\nMy mom wanted cookies. Came by with a Groupon Now on my phone and was told that we couldn't use it because the cashier didn't know what it was. It took about ten minutes of me explaining that it's a coupon for Teddy's specifically, a lot of arguing, and three phone calls before it was honored. During this time I was also told it couldn't be honored because-\n\n- He's never seen one before.\n- The manager wasn't there.\n- It needed to be printed.\n- I could use it on Thursday when the manager was in (defeats the purpose of a Groupon Now, right?)\n- He couldn't call the manager again because she was busy.\n\nWhile I inevitably got my cookies with my Groupon special, the energy and effort that went into the use was extremely annoying. Groupon isn't exactly a new concept anymore. I tried to be as polite as possible with the cashier (since he clearly wasn't doing it to be a jerk) but I do feel that management should properly alert the staff when they run a Groupon so that the staff in the bakery know what to expect."
28180,0,I had lunch there yesterday.\nThey have a very nice ambience and perfect service. The staff is great.\nI wouldn't recommend the pineapple fried rice or the nasi goran because it had a funky taste. My pineapple fried rice came with a duck and Chinese sausage... Didn't taste fresh to me.\nVery overpriced... Disappointing.
9521,3,HORRIBLE BUFFET! TGIFridays is good as usual with a great staff.  The layout is great and there is no shortage on gambling options. Can't wait for the construction to be done.
1553,4,Brought my Yorkie in and they did an amazing job! Making my next appointment now. They clipped his nails bathed and cut and even cleaned his ears. This was one of the best experiences I have had at a groomers and I highly recommend them!
21823,0,"It was the only Chinese take out around the Rhodes Ranch area for awhile. To be honest, the food is average and a bit pricey in comparison to other establishments.\n\nOn the positive, their honey walnut shrimp is very tasty and I recommend it.  \n\nMy only real complaint, which is a pretty big deal is that they have awful customer service.  Phone orders are always rushed and they dont reiterate your order so you dont know if they got it right. Also, they're not very welcoming at all. When you go in, they appear to just care about taking your money and rarely thank you. I always feel cheated or wrong about giving them business. The Hawaiian place door always shows their gratitude and China A No No should learn from them. I would not recommend. Try Pumi, instead."
31,3,Good. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. Went yesterday with family and enjoyed oysters(very fresh). I always like appetizers more than their entrees
19366,1,Nice place but poor customer service and staff! Always state they are fully booked and not enough cleaning staff. Rooms are not updated and not thoroughly clean.  Rooms not ready to well past check-in time (7pm)..horrible for a family starting vacation.  They have had made major cutbacks since their own new ownership.  Condos is not not even stocked with enough toilet paper or extra paper products.  Greens on golf course were okay definitely not well-maintained compared to the other resorts in the area.  Overall this was an okay resort definitely would be a great place to stay with the family if ownership was different and the place was maintained the way it should be.

Im just reviewing Delta's gates here in PHX.  Also, disclaimer, this isn't a \""grumpy\"" review, the service is fine and Im not mad at anyone, this is data driven around the comparative offerings.

The situation is not good:\n\n- One restroom with a tiny entrance and exit, always crowded in there and you bump elbows coming in/out\n- Food: Wendy's and a tired \""Cantina\""\n- No bookstore\n- No soda stop/drink stop\n- No coffee store\n- No bakery\n- Gross worn out carpets\n- Crowded wait areas with few seats\n- 2 charging stations per gate (I counted them; it only took a moment to double check)\n\nDelta, when you get a minute, would you pretty please update your gate area here in PHX, to the extent you are able?

44919,1,"Chose this restaurant because Gordon Ramsey is so damn tough on his show looking for top quality tasty food, so of course I would expect a restaurant to bear his name to be awesome.  What a disappointment, hubs ordered a steak, very pricey, but very flavorless.  I ordered the tomato bisque, while it was tasty, it definitely wasn't worth over $13 for a bowl of soup. Waitress seemed uninterested in her job, only took our order, and gave us our bill.  She wasn't the one to bring our food, and never once checked on us during the meal to see how we were doing.  As my first trip here to vegas, I am going to say that all of these restaurants really are not great, but what do they care? 90% of their business is tourist! their money doesn't come from repeat business."
8788,4,"So as we were driving down Mill, I saw this store and had to drop by.  The fiance should be glad that I wasn't in the store too long and that I made a great effort at not looking at all the books they had.  I could spend days  and do a lot of damage in here.  \n\nThe store is awesome and I wish I could visit it again, but it will be closed the next time I am in town."
9918,4,"This is a must eat restaurant if you are hungry and wanting a wonderful service that is different than the typical casino restaurants.  The waiters or as they called themselves the \""Captains\"" are extremely friendly and hilarious.  After a long day of work, this is a best place to chill and relax.  It may look a bit fancy, but the atmosphere and everyone there are very friendly.\n\nOut of all the food that I've tried, the one dish that I am keep coming back for more is the Osso Buco.  It's the best dish there...the meat is sooo soft and tender and if you are up for it, you can try to suck out the bone marrow on that bone...yummm.\n\nI've been working in and out of Vegas for the last 3 years, and every year, I am coming back to this restaurant.\n\nTHe price is pretty steep, but it worth every penny to be entertained by the Captains and served with one of the best foods."
22501,3,"I keep coming back here for their burgers but their drinks seem to be a miss which seems weird for a brewery.  I think they keep trying to be \""unique\"".  Beers have been warm, cocktails are a huge miss.  I've tried several different ones.  One I deemed the worse drink I've ever had.  Even my husband couldn't drink it.  I didn't see it on the menu this last visit, maybe they realized it was bad.  It was a mix of 4 things which included their signature beer but none of them blended.  Awful.  This last visit I just wanted a house margarita.  Everyone can make a margarita, right?  Turns out it was their san-tan arita which had an IPA mixed into it.  Sigh.  That would explain the color and flavor I didn't enjoy.  We happened to go on a game night and they shut off sound to the game so the live performer could set up.  I love that they give performers a chance but felt bad for the guy that was victim to bad timing.  Maybe don't sign up a performer on game nights.  Choose sports OR live performance.  \nBut back to the 4 starts.  Their food has been great.  I crave their burgers AND fries.  I'll just plan on not ordering any of their drinks from now on."
48486,2,"Not too bad, but not amazing either. There are three courses (all 18 holes each). We played one full course and a few holes that were creative as well. The price is 10 per person which I feel is a little pricey for what you get. Little kids will have a blast with this course. Adults may want to head to a different mini golf to keep their attention. The best part about this place is you get to escape the heat for about an hour. Overall I would come back if I was bored, but I feel there are better choices out there."
4458,3,"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Really nice people run the place and it's relatively inexpensive. I had the pad see ew, the mint chicken and the tom yum soup. Their soup is probably the best tom yum I have had in town."
21426,0,"The check in process took way too long which caused us to miss the show. The show itself was fine, but not worth more than 10 dollars."
42889,4,"Finally tried this place after knowing about it and driving by dozens of times.. Hopefully it won't be so long until my next visit as I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The smell inside this place is amazing..  I really had a tough time deciding what to get as everything looked and sounded really good.  Started with the fried pickles - quite tasty.  Ended up getting the 3-meat platter with the Turkey, Brisket, and Ribs - mashed potatoes and cornbread for the sides.  The food came out quickly as it was pretty slow for an early Tuesday night.  Everything was wonderful.  The brisket was sliced thin.. the ribs fell off the bone.. and the turkey was juicy and flavorful.  Potatoes and cornbread were good though they were just sides and my main focus was on the meat.  \n\nThe service was great.. our server Madison was very friendly and attentive.  The place itself was nice looking with a modern/rustic look - the wooden tables and lighting were quite nice.  Food prices were pretty reasonable.. $8 for a cocktail was a bit steep for me, but overall I give this place an A+"
3141,0,"Warning...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS PLACE.  Just moved here, my boyfriend made an appointment first due to scheduling issues and I couldn't believe it when he came home and told me how this place conducts business.  He told them not to dilate his eyes as he wasn't having problems and the receptionist (not a nurse or doctor) told him HAD to do it.  Then at checkout even though he was only trying the contacts they collected money and ordered contacts instead of waiting until he went back for a follow-up to confirm that the contacts were the correct ones for him.  Sure enough a few days later he couldn't wear them, when he went back for his follow-up, they gave another kind to try.  I wasn't very impressed when he said they office staff was totally different and he saw a different doctor as well.  They didn't bother to set a follow-up so I've been waiting for a prescription or call for follow-up but apparently since they've already collected money from us and the insurance they were done.\n\n Finally today I had had enough of the foolishness and went to get a copy of the prescription, only to hear it had never been \""finalized\"" by the doctor because there had never been a follow-up appointment.  I was absolutely appalled by the attitude of the \""receptionist\"" when I pointed out they had never set an appointment or called, of course she was maybe 19 and acted like she had no common sense.  I demanded a refund of the money collected the day of the appointment for the contacts as there were never any contacts purchased.  According to the office manager,  they had used up the majority of the insurance benefit between the \""fitting\"" and other services rendered and if they refunded any money we would have to pay for the fitting fee.  \n\nFinally I told them I know what they are doing is wrong, just as they do, which will be reported to the insurance; however, I'd rather go to a professional eye doctor and pay out of pocket for my boyfriend to have eye exam.  This office is obviously just looking to screw people out of money and don't care if they have to lie to do it."
41154,3,"Wow...considering the mixed reviews here, I had to chime in as well.\n\nI was greeted by a very friendly hostess who offered to seat me, or redirect me to the bar, if I preferred.  My choice should be obvious.\n\nThe bartender was great.  Very engaging, made some good drink specials, and chatted the whole time.\n\nI had the inferno burger, which I thought was delicious.  A spicy burger that is ACTUALLY spicy!  Finally!  I'm sooooo bored with all the lame attempts to appease the masses by marketing a spicy dish that disappoints on the Scoville scale.  (I think I've mentioned that I have to plead with my Thai food servers that I really mean 10....maybe even 11)\n\nOur group also shared some onion rings, fried pickles, and fried mac & cheese.  I'm not a fan of mac & cheese anyway, so I won't elaborate on that one, but the onion rings were top notch.  Great crisp, fresh sweet onions, and good dipping sauce.  The fried pickles were amazing!  I love that they use full length sandwich slices and batter fry them.  I would just order those next time.\n\nI think this is a good little spot.  I'll return there for lunch or happy hour for sure."
2707,3,"I stayed many a moon at the Golf Resort back in the 90's when it was the ONLY place to stay anywhere near Power Road and it was actually pretty much in the middle of nowhere with nothing of interest around it except for a HEB grocery nearby and a smattering of restaurants that closed at 9:00 because nearly all the nearby residents were retirees.  Imagine that!\n\nNice spacious rooms and a great place to get together as a group and grill outside on their grills, and if you played golf that was even better.  I understand it's showing her age these days and is probably due for some updating.  Still, it was a great place and hopefully will remain so."
9266,1,"The domestic terminal has improved significantly since I was here about six years ago. And the improvements are impressive, especially free WiFi. There are two bad things about this airport: (a) if you fly into the international terminal and need to make a connecting domestic flight, you must exit the international terminal, walk about 15 to 20 minutes outside in the hot sun and reenter the airport and go through check in and security again; and (b) those money eating slot machines are everywhere to rob you of your coins and dollar bills. So, if you are bringing any duty-free alcohol from abroad and you are carrying your booze with you, they will make you discard your precious liquids, or you need to stick them inside your check in luggage (and hope, the bottles don't break)."
41003,3,"I've been going to hot n juicy for a couple years now. I go monthly to twice a month. I was a little biased, but the staff at Boiling Crab won me over.\n\nYou basically order your seafood of choice, pick a sauce, then pick a heat level.\n\n\nI like how they have their own cups and bags for to go food. It's a nice touch.\n\nWe had a server, Shelly, who was delightful. She pretty much waited on our party of about 7 alone. She checked on us frequently, refilled our drinks often, and we never had to look for her.\n\nThe food was good. I got a lb of shrimp in the whole she-bang. This is their three sauces mixed together. It was good over all but I thought it lacked in citrus flavor. I'll definitely get lemon pepper next time as a squirt of lime really made the sauce taster for my pallet. \n\nI also had some calamari, sweet potato fries, lemon pepper fries, and Cajun fries. It was a cool option to choose spice level on the Cajun fries. I also took some gumbo the go which was delicious.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my first time at boiling crab. Would I return? Yes. The staff I encountered all seemed happy,  our server did a great job, and my food was comparable to hot n juicy."
8631,3,"This Oregano's location is always busy, so be prepared for a wait of 30-60 minutes.\n\nI've been here 7 or 8 times for dinner over the past year. The food is always delicious, and the portions are enormous. If you're looking for good pasta/pizza at a reasonable price, this is the place to go. The Bollo Pasta and Alfredo the Dark are two of my favorites. If you want pizza, go with the Deep Dish -- very rich and flavorful.\n\nI'll be visiting this location many more times during the upcoming year."
27657,1,"My husband and I got married at the Montelucia April 2, 2011. While I LOVED OUR WEDDING and the hotel did manage to surprise us that day...the stress that the resort caused us before the wedding was not worth it. We started working with the hotel in May 2010 and through the entire process worked with 4 different people in catering....2 of which left the resort and one of which was so awful that we had to ask to work with her supervisor, Tracy Mead. The hotel had lots of turn over and was very unorganized. Planning a wedding is supposed to be a happy time but the Montelucia made the process AWFUL. Once Tracy took over (after 7 months of hell) things seemed to work out a little better. We still had issues with booking guest rooms and an issue with our contract which I do not even want to get into. \n\nOur wedding DAY was amazing and the staff on hand that day went the extra mile to make sure it was. I had a shadow the entire night and she was the best! Our bridal suite was beautiful as well. Tracy Mead did turn things around in the end but I still would not recommend getting married here. While the Montelucia is the most beautiful venue to get married at in Scottsdale in my opinion the internal issues we went through with the hotel were unnecessary and extremely stressful."
45512,1,I'm not a fan I'm trying to figure or what I didnt like.  Could be the quality of the ingredients. Maybe not the freshest. Like chipolte it tasted very salty.  I think I prefer chipolte.  I had a beef burrito. Maybe I like fresh carne asada.  Even filbertos has better flavor beef. The diet coke was very good.  I hated the hot salsa.
30763,0,"What the heck.  \nAs we waited 45 minutes for our car to be washed we noticed a lot of complaints going on. Looks like something may have been stolen out of a couple of cars not exactly sure. We had just come back from Costco bought two things one of them was a gallon of pure maple syrup.  Not a big deal until it goes missing! Who wants maple syrup really! My husband called in the morning to see if maybe it had been in lost and found manager says will look into it call him back.  two days later no call back. Doesn't matter if it's maple syrup, Or something expensive the fact that you can't take your car to get cleaned without having to worry if they're going to steal something is very scary\nOutside as the cars were being cleaned it sounded like there was a competition going on as to how many cars they can get done in an hour.   What a bunch of chaos will not go back!"
5949,1,"I've been here a few times -- my husband really likes it but for me, I have yet to order an entree that I would order again.  There are only titles on the menu, no descriptions so you kind of have to guess what's in the dish from the titile and sometimes it is just wrong.  I do like the scallion pancake with egg appetizer but the noodle soup that I had the last time we were there was not good at all.  Very bland and with an overabundance of white, wide over-cooked noodles.  I think I'm giving up on the entrees.  If we go again, I'll stick to the scallion pancake and bubble tea."
39295,0,"Although the owners are friendly and the store looks nice, we will not be going back.  We bought a rope toy for our 7 mo. old small dog which he played with for an hour the first day.  The toy immediately started to fray.  When I called the store and explained the problem, she told me there was nothing she could do about it.  I guess I will continue to shop at stores that stand behind their merchandise.  I certainly will not shop at this store again nor will I recommend it to anyone else."
49698,0,"I LOVE pizza, and was looking forward to picking up a pie last night.  I'm sadly on a carb restricted diet, so I save up my calories for weekly treats like this, and this fell way short.  \n\nThe pizza was undercooked, the sauce was way to sweet, and the cheese only covered half the pizza.  I would say that Gus's Pizza in Tempe is comparable, or probably actually better, but Spinelli's prices were about twice as high. I don't mind paying for good pizza (Cibo, Joe's NY Pizza, Ciao Grazie, Il Bosco, etc.) but this pizza just made me sad and angry.\n\nTaking a look at the reviews it looks like an even mix between customers that shared my experience, and fake reviews from people that clearly must be friends of employees here."
11549,1,"We took advantage of good Fridays and were able to get our tickets at half price. I'm very glad we did, because I would have been very disappointed had I paid full price. I'm glad we visited the museum, but I wouldn't revisit it. The space itself was sparse and uninviting. I get that he was an eccentric man, but I think they could've done a better job displaying his art."
41084,4,"Amazing little wine bar! They have some seriously wonderful appetizers. You can't go wrong with the cheese board, the flatbreads, the charcuterie board, or the warm brie... They're all to die for! OH, the olives are great too! I wasn't thrilled with the shrimp and tomatoes to be honest, but that was my only disappointment. One more thing I was simply so bummed about was they discontinued the rock shrimp and that was my FAVORITE. I still ask every time I go in just to see if they will bring it back. :) You just cannot beat the wine and beer selection, the delicious food, and the great ambiance. This is a must try!"

Pricing is usually fair but I have left several time feeling taken advantage of. ie. special event flats rates when you are not there for said event.\n\nOtherwise I usually feel safe leaving my car here, kept pretty clean, and within walking distance to just about anything. I'll be back!"
30527,0,"I would NOT recommend this restaurant.  Uninteresting menu, overpriced tapas, and the atmosphere was strange.  It was a weekend night and there were few people in the restaurant.  The large size of the restaurant made the lack of people very noticeable.  The server was a very nice younger man and he did a great job, in spite of the mediocre food and weird atmosphere."
808,3,"Hard to pass up the Road Kill Burrito.  Ask for the bucket of sauces.\nIt was as good as when I tried it ten years ago as it was last week.\nI don't think much has changed around here in 30 years, but that is definitely part of the charm.  I have heard the fish fry is good, but I have never been there on a Friday night.  \nLunch crowd has a lot of regular guys, quick and friendly service, prompt and hot food.  \nDon't go looking for the lobster.  Go for the specials, burgers, beer or the burrito!"
29379,1,"first time here was a year ago. went with 2 of my friends, and we ended up going to their walk-up counter because the wait for an inside table was about an hour. we ordered small frozen hot chocolate. \n\ni must say - i wasnt really impressed. it tasted like a chocolate shake with sprinkles. maybe its better if you go inside to order it? i dont know...\n\nsecond time i met some friends in town. they were eating dinner (i didnt eat because i just ate). everything looked really good and portions were pretty decent as well. \n\nthird time we went in was a few weeks ago with my sister and some friends back home. ordered a frozen hot chocolate and a frozen white hot chocolate. i couldnt remember how big they were or how \""eh\"" they were, but my sisters never been and we were already there. my sister ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two because her and her boyfriend were gonna share it. and it was waaaaaaaaaaay too much frozen hot chocolate! and as rich as it is, you really dont need anymore than a small. \n\nservice was alright - the cashier there was a little slow at ringing in orders/putting the tickets up on the rail. and it seemed they were short staffed or something because the girl making the drinks seemed overwhelmed the whole time we were there. agian, maybe the hype was built up so much i expected a lot?\n\nmaybe i'll come back, stick out the wait and eat inside?"
20510,3,"Stop by this place on a whim.  Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken (white meat, which is nice).  The Mongolian Beef was very tasty.  But the Orange Chicken could use a bit of improvement on the flavor.  They got the order ready at the time they said they would.  Also the corn egg soup was nice and light.  Would definitely go back to pick up food on this place."
3917,1,After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.
18227,1,"I went here several years ago and, while still not good, it was tolerable in the non-swimming area. \n\n1 - It looks like that haven't watered the grass since then because it was in bad shape when I first went there, and a few years later it is gone.  And by gone I mean 90% of it is dirt.  Minus 1 star\n\n2 - There aren't any trees in to provide shade, the only option is a covered picnic area with 4 tables on the non-lake side.  That will be a problem once it gets warmer.  Being in the middle of the desert, shade should be a priority because we are known for our 100+ temps for nearly half the year.  minus 1 star\n\n3 - No one that goes to Cosmo picks up poop.  Maybe it is that by being well known it attracts people that just don't belong at dog parks.  Whoever they are out in Gilbert, inconsiderate and poor etiquette are the norm, not the exception apparently.  There was a nice senior gentleman picking up the insane amounts of poo with the scooper to make it tolerable in the lake area.  There were literally hundreds of poops in the other side that no one picked up in the several hours I was there.  There were probably 20-40 poops I passed on the walk from the parking lot to the park.      -1\n\n4 - With popularity comes the morons.  You think managing a double gate and understanding its purpose would be fairly self explanatory.  WRONG!  When I arrived and left people just stood there with the doors open letting everyone's dogs get into the holding pen area and then leaving them in there.  After watching the circus for about 30 seconds each time I had to tell the people to just get out of the way.  There is no reason to hold the gate for someone so 10 dogs can pile up and come close to running away.  At the usual parks I go to I've never had this problem.  (I won't mention those in fear that the Cosmo hoard will take over my parks)      -1\n\n5 - The parking situation is a mess.  The park is huge, popularity is very high and they have very limited spots (maybe 30?) and the lot is about 100-150 yards away from the park entrance.  Obviously not a deal breaker since you are there to exercise you and your pet but certainly not convenient.  -1  \n\n6 - The lake side has the pro of gravel so there is no mud, and no grass for them to screw up by not watering it.  My dogs don't swim, but they have a habit of nibbling on poop which is why I was forced to bring them to the water side to avoid the proliferation of land mines.  +1 \n\n7 - There is a little dog area.  Therefore people with little dogs can't complain about how the big dogs are... you know... acting like regular dogs. +1\n   \nThat leaves me with 2 stars.  If your dog doesn't swim, don't waste your time, even if you live within walking distance.  Of the 6 or so dog parks I've gone to in town this is by far the worst maintained by the city but more importantly it has the patrons with the worst etiquette.  Too bad because it has huuuuuge potential."

6243,0,"Worse McDonald's I have ever been to. I live close so I eat here whenever Its late or early. No matter what time you come whether late or early they are always slow. I stand in line for 5 to 10 min just to get my order taken when there's not even a line. You will be standing there waiting while theres groups of employees talking...gossipping....cussing. The drive thru is just as slow except you better expect to go in to get what they forgot to put in bag....whether that be food...creamers and sugars for coffee...I recommend HOLDING UP THE LINE TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT IT RIGHT and maybe eventually these clowns will learn to get it right. Customer service is also horrible ..the kids that work there are feisty young black females who could care less to be there let alone deal with you. Out of all the times I've been there being a regular there maybe once have they said thank you when they hand me my food despite the fact I say it each time I get my food. I was raised with manners though, i recommend bojangles across the street."
36538,4,"I don't know what else to add that hasn't already been covered.  This made-to-order frozen dessert place is entertaining and an exercise in patience.  Watching the Ice Pan folks slap your (non)dairy atoms on the icepan is definitely a fun show.  Of course, all the while you're watching, you're wishing that the process would just hurry-up-a-bit-because-you-really-want-your-dessert!\n\nChoose from your choice of dairy milk or non-dairy milk, then select your choice of flavour, then decide upon the topping(s).  No preservatives or additives (except what may be in the toppings -- Oreos, Reese pb cups, etc.) and all made in front of your eyes in about 2 minutes.  (I timed it.)  \n\nIt's too bad that one has to fight through the Harrah's smoky casino to get to Ice Pan, but it's worth it.  Be prepared to wait a while; we checked out Ice Pan on a weekday during the late afternoon and despite being 2 of about 5 people in the queue, it still took about 15 minutes for the Ice Pan folks to start our order.  We forgot that pain as soon as we tasted our dessert though.  :)"
36505,2,"today was my first time visiting Razberry. I was warmly welcomed by a very sweet selling assistant. She was helpful without being too pushy. I did not feel like I had to buy the things I tried on. Also, I found the clothes were unique, and one of a kind pieces easily to find in this tiny boutique. If your style is more classic, you will probably enjoy another boutique more.  A little bit pricey so I suggest taking advantage of end of season sales. I will definitely come back."
10822,4,"Like others, I'm writing a post-mortem tribute to one of my favorite restaurants in the world.\n\nMy husband and I first went to Rosemary's on our honeymoon in 2001. We've been there on every trip to LV since, and we also went to the second restaurant they had at the Rio for a while. Every  visit was a delight.\n\nMichael and Wendy, as someone who recently closed a restaurant (and is in the process of selling a second one) my heart goes out to you.  Know that you are missed, and that  I (and many many others, I'm sure) am monitoring the internet to see what you have in store for us next.\n\n~~A fan from Texas"
36397,2,"It's Burger King, there's not much to say, but this is a nice, clean location. Good service, 24 hours and they have my favorite drink of all time... VAULT soda on tap lol."
45596,2,I have to say some items are overpriced. The bubble tea is nice. The food is ok for me.
18447,3,"Awesome lunch spot! Every time I go here I leave satisfied... I used to go here all the time when I worked at Skysong but now have moved up to DC Ranch area. \n\nNot going to lie, I have driven all the way down to Old Town on several occasions just to get lunch here... Granted I am obsessive and like the place alot, but either way, great little spot that you might miss driving by it!\n\nHere are why I don't give it 5-stars:\n--They need more hours, open later... I mean their location is out of the Old Town foot traffic, I get it, but still!\n--Need to get the Drive Through situation worked out a little better..."
28212,4,Posh is one of the coolest restaurants I have experienced.  The menu consists of all the protein they have available that day and you get to mark off what you do not like.  The number of courses depends on how much you would like to spend.  This place is so fun because you really have no idea what you are going to get.  I had the most amazing scallop app and short rib entree. I would highly recommend this place.
43702,3,"Impromptu stop here for a small bite.  Did happy hour with two visiting friends from Seattle.  Really enjoyed the place and we were all quite pleased with our food.  Mussels, fish tacos, verde stew and fried green tomatoes."
31019,1,"I don't know man. My dude and I came in here for some drinks before our reservation over at Herbs & Rye and as soon as I walked in I had a bad vibe. I thought the bartender was friendly but the crowd was pretty shifty.  A random guy came over and just started bragging about his job and the people he worked with.  A woman from across the bar kept looking over at me, even after I gave her a good stare down. \nThe best part was that 2 beers and 2 shots of Jameson came in under $10-15. \n \n I like my drinks cheap and this place did that for me, but I also like to be comfortable in my surroundings.  Not sure if I'd come back."
16791,1,"The only reason we ate here was because of the two free buffets that came with my hotel reservation.  Decided to go for breakfast as I would wind up resenting spending a dinner meal here when there are so many awesome dining options in a town like Las Vegas.\n\nThere are plenty of options but all of them are just OK at best with the lone exceptions being the egg/omlette station where they make your stuff to order and the ham from the carving station.  Everything else was just mass produced, blah food.  Picture over cooked eggs (scrambled, Benedict), bland sausage patties, frozen pizza slices...  \n\nWe did experience some excitement during the meal when an old lady in her electric cart plowed over another woman who was walking near our table.  When the other woman went flying, she took out a couple empty chairs and just missed wiping out my son!  Thankfully, she seemed to be ok although an incident report was being filled out as we left."
38603,3,"I had my meal on the premises while with a friend (I usually take it home) and it was a pretty decent experience.  The store is clean and the staff are so friendly they make you feel right at home.  Thanks, PoS!"
32599,2,"I have been passing by this little greasy spoon, dive diner for some time. I decided one Saturday that I needed to stop in and try it out. There is not a lot of seating present and you can tell most of the patrons are regulars. We found one table open and sat ourselves. \n\nThe cook/hostess/server/busser was with us in moments of being seated and taking our order. We both decided on the 2 egg breakfast with water and she was gone instantaneously. It was amazing how ephemeral she was in her movements and appeared as though she was in multiple places from time-to-time; an obvious benefit of working in such a small diner coupled with years of experience.\n\nOur drinks and food were quick to come out and nothing looked out of place. Nothing that we ate would ever be considered gastronomy, but it was all tasty and cooked properly. The real shock was the price tag; I don't know that I could cook breakfast for that low a price. I will definitely return when I want a quick breakfast."
5208,4,"Insanely good find!\n\nWe were visiting from out-of-town and staying on the strip, but decided to check out something a bit outside the \""normal\"" zone. This place was rated highly on Yelp, and so a taxi-ride later ($20), we were there. Where \""there\"" is exactly is hard to say for us, and we had to look around to find the exact location of the place (it's in the middle \""island\"" building on the right). It's located right in the middle of some Korean restaurants, and is definitely not your standard \""strip\"" business - it's not at all notable from the outside.\n\nThe inside is another matter. We chose to sit at the bar to watch the itamae at work, but we liked the set up of the tables and the main room. I was immediately intrigued by the aquariums in the back that housed live flounder, prawns, and abalone. I inquired about the abalone (it wasn't on the menu), and was a bit taken aback at the price ($25), but ordered it anyway due to the fact that we were on vacation, and I couldn't recall ever seeing it on a menu before. It was fantastic - very nice, firm, texture and a very oceany- (almost uni-like) taste.\n\nI decided to have some of the prawn, too (also not on the menu), and was very pleased with that, too. They serve the prawn raw, first, and after you've had the tail, they then tempura-fry the head. It was extraordinary!\n\nWe had some other dishes, too: some of them ordered by us, and some of them presented to us by the owner (we ordered a few things that weren't in-stock, and I think it was a very nice and appreciated gesture). Everything we had, from start to finish, was just excellent: fresh tako, hamachi, and unagi sushi, and a HUGE \""special\"" maki roll. The sake was good, and reasonably priced too. I was so full by the end of the meal, I couldn't fit any uni, and that's a first for me!\n\nThe only (very minor) complaint I have is that they didn't have closed-captioning on the TV's. \n\nI highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a fantastic meal of sushi in Vegas.. It doesn't have the ambiance of a Tao or Koi, and it's not a teppenyaki place, but that's not what I'm looking for in a sushi restaurant anyway. We spent over $50/person (because we wanted to..the food was GOOD!) but could just as easily have spent $25/person if we wanted to be more wallet-conscious.\n\nWe'll definitely be going back the next time we're there!"
2498,1,The food was awful. My mushroom ravioli was rubbery and so unappetizing looking they should have been ashamed to let it out of the kitchen. My daughters chicken was so overcooked she could not cut it. The waiter told us we should have sent it back but he did not come back to check on us. Will never go back to this location again. Stay away there are a lot of other restaurants nearby try one of those
43720,0,"The food here is great, but the service is TERRIBLE.  I have been there twice, and the first time I figured the poor and rude service was a fluke so I didn't write a review.  Well, we gave it another try and again...TERRIBLE service.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him, and walked away before we even finished talking.  We waited 15 minutes for our table, which I wouldn't have minded, but the hostess said they had a table almost ready for us when we walked in.  It took forever to get our bill (hand scratched on a notepad), and we were overcharged for our drinks.  Happy hour prices are awesome and I really do like the food, but because of the poor/lazy/rude attitudes of the wait staff I will not be coming back.  The bus boys were very on top of things, but without a better trained wait staff I don't see why people would come back.  Check out Firefly on the same block for even better food and fantastic service :)"
35251,4,"Really delicious! I've been looking for some Indian food for awhile and decided to try this place out. Definitely going to have to become a regular. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was the best I've had. as well as the naan, which was also excellent! A must go for sure!"
27565,1,"Well, the rolls here are pretty special. The \""Jimmy the Attorney\"" and the OMG roll are fantastic as is the price, $18.95 all you can eat. The carpet was in need of a vacuuming and some of the \""food safe\"" practices were questionable. I will try it again in a few weeks."
44052,1,Eggs benedict sandwich great idea poor execution very bland and tasteless not enough ham English muffin was stale.
40744,1,"Well, I hate when I'm the outlier to otherwise really good reviews, because it means we probably just caught them on a bad night. That being said, we won't ever be back. Went last Sunday evening for my birthday, service was terrible. And I mean not just normal terrible but I thought about leaving less than 15% terrible which is just unheard of for ex servers like us. Food was only mediocre.\n\nThe first of our party of four arrived and was seated on the patio at 5:55. The patio is amazing of course with all the nice couches etc, unless you are sat at a little plastic fold up table with folding chairs like we were. The rest of us arrived at 6 and finally at 6:10 our server came by for the first time and took our drink order. We still didn't even have waters yet. Our server was clearly swamped, and seemed responsible for the entire patio which was full. We would have to flag her down for every interaction going forward, and then wait forever for whatever we ordered to arrive.\n\nI started with a glass of sangria, it was okay. We had the cheese board and the bruschetta, they were okay. We had a couple of pizzas, they were okay. The food was noticeably worse than, Postino for example. My companions all thought the pizza was pretty good, but they are wrong. :)\n\nSo yeah, I'm sure it's better than the experience we had there and I don't feel like blathering on about just how bad the service was that night, but I won't be back. Oh another thing, they cut their bruschetta into 3 slices instead of 4. Our little group of 4 are regulars at Postino who of course do 4 slices each so that was pretty tilting. :)"
37864,2,"Came here for brunch. I tried a lot of food but none seems to stand out. Although the heirloom tomato salad with mozz cheese tasted fresh, firm and well balanced. I liked the availability of the quince paste, cheese and cold cuts.  The Kale salad was too vinegary and killed the kale.  Had a shredded beef eggs Benedict and thought the hollandaise had no life. The watermelon sriracha was interesting.  Not impressed as of now but they have the resources to be much better."
3455,1,"I saw a someone praise this place on Facebook and I started chuckling. My wife asked me to go with her to the melting pot a couple years ago. She was very excited until the food actually came. That's when she said, this isn't what we ordered. I said yeah there is less then 4 oz of meat to share between 2 people. She said, no I meant these are the wrong sauces. I said hang on. We are paying 120 dollars for 2 cups of raw vegetables, 4 oz of meat, and beef stock? She said well your paying for the ambiance. Plus desert is to die for. Desert came, she said Isn't this great and I said we are dipping less then a cup of fruit in chocolate. At the end she said you hated it, didn't you. I said baby I loved being there with you, but I have never paid so much money in all my life to eat every day food and stay hungry. For the same money we could have gone to any number of nice restaurants and actually had a full meal.  My wife laughed and then said yeah your right. It's a great little niche restaurant idea, but once you get past all the hoopla this is place is a huge rip off.  On the plus side, It's a nice romantic place with super dark tables. Cooking your own food gives you plenty of time to sit and talk with that special someone."
469,4,"Until Del Frisco showed up, best steak and best wine list in town!!!  Now...it's a toss up.  Wait staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly.  Go light on the app's, everyone...the steaks are ridiculously large.  They've got one of those wine lists that is made for every single person that can walk through that door...great whites and great reds...excellence whether you're staying under 20 bucks, or if you're budget is big time.  Also, the bar out front is a great place to enjoy some happy hour and watch the cougars on the prowl...fun people watching."
37027,1,"Food portions were huge, food was just meh."
40430,1,"Note - I did not eat here.\n\nBut I did stop in for what I thought would be a great martini.\n\nService was fine, I had a quiet seat at the bar.\n\nBut, this martini bar has a selection of only 4 major market gins, which is awfully lean.  I ordered a gin martini (not dry) and got gin shaken with ice, no vermouth.  At least I was asked whether I wanted the blue cheese olives or regular.  Although the olive pick didn't clear the rim of the glass.\n\nI'm sure the signature cocktails are fine, but that martini was evidence of an overall unserious attitude towards martinis.  Which would be excusable, if the restaurant didn't use \""martini\"" in its name. \n\n I was a little disappointed and confused."
22096,3,"By far!! Big Al's is the best restaurant inside The Orleans Hotel & Casino.  After walking around the Casino looking for something to eat without heading to the strip, we walked pass Al's.  The menu looked interesting and inviting.\n\nOur waitress was very helpful and friendly, giving us several great suggestions on the menu, which we used wisely.  \n\nI started with a cup of some of the best Boston Clam Chowder I've had outside the New England area.  It was smooth and creamy with lots of lovely calms.  The flavors were very delightful, light, but filling.\n\nNext I partook the Soft-shell Crab Po Boy, Fresh French bread with two large lightly beer-battered crabs, cleaned and prepared perfectly.  I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh and sweet the crab tasted. Beautiful red tomato slices and crisp lettuce and a zesty Creole mayo spread.\n\nAlso ordered at the table was the Louisiana Crab Cakes with a Creole mustard sauce.  I had few of bites of these also. The cakes were fairly large and of good thickness.  There were lumps of sweet crabmeat, and not \""krab\"".  The veggies were finely diced, as I prefer.  I hate biting into large chucks of veggies.  Great seasoning was used as well, spicy, but not too hot.\n\nI will definitely roll back over to Big Al's from The Strip the next time I'm in Vegas.  For the quality of the meal and the good prices, $12 for the Po Boy (2 large crabs) and another $12 for two good size crab cakes with real crab lump meat. I'll be a repeat customer."
34979,1,"So, we came here for a late lunch at 4pm with a group total of 9. 8 total people eating and one baby. The hostess decided to give us crap because we told her 8 instead of 9. Then proceeded to give us an attitude about how many kids were in our group. What does it matter? Is there a kids menu at Bachi Burger? Not that I know of... Anyway, we left after sitting there from 3:45 to 4:20 without getting seated and went to the Bachi Burger in Summerlin. Really disappointed. 2 stars because I know the food is great. -3 for horrible service.\n\nBTW the service at Bachi Burger in Summerlin was excellent. I'll write another separate review for that establishment."
18194,0,Called for the House Special Fried Rice with chicken and shrimp and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. Both sucked. I could feel the crunch of MSG on both. BBQ pork had no flavor (zero). House Special Fried Rice was nothing but normal fried rice with chicken and shrimp. Nothing great about the ambience. Go only if you are craving for low grade asian food.
19144,0,"One of the WORST pharmacies ever!  I live near here (for many years) and have used them ONLY because of the location.  I am now moving ALL my prescriptions elsewhere.... EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to refill a med I have been on since 1999 IT IS NOTHING BUT A MAJOR HASSLE !   They can't seem to co-ordinate their phone system with their email system etc.  I only recently found out that THEY USE A CALL CENTER WHICH IS A HUGE PART OF THE PROBLEM !   Last time I went to refill they kept trying to blame my Dr.s office and when I called my Dr. they have this same issue with Walgreens ALL THE TIME !   I AM SO SICK OF DEALING WITH THEM THERE I AM MOVING EVERYTHING TO THE CLOSEST CVS to me.  I called CVS to see if they use a 'call center' for their scripts and they DO NOT.   I HATE THIS WALGREENS,   AND  there is a pharmacy tech there who has a REALLY BAD ATTITUDE all the time!   When you call this store you don't realize that you are actually NOT talking to the store... but to a call center nowhere near your store that you THOUGHT you were talking to !!!   INCOMPETENCE AT ITS FINEST IN MY OPINION which is based on 13 years of history with them !"
32346,3,"This is going to be one of those hazy reviews where I can sort of remember stuff but the fact that we were at Frankie's Tiki Room immediately before this makes it pretty damn difficult to remember what happened here. I definitely shattered my phone screen and lost my suit jacket either before or after arriving at this establishment...or so I was told.\n\nWe definitely came here for the 12a - 3a happy hour. Fact. I ordered a steak and then spent 5 minutes talking to the bartender and owner about the last drink we had at Frankie's and if there was anyway they could create something similar. Apparently I did not insult anyone or molest patrons while doing this and my drink order was taken. I believe everything up to this point to be factual. Now once the steaks came, that's where I lose it again. I think the steaks were really good. However, that was mainly from my less drunk better half telling me that her steak was really good. I also think I dug the interior; wooden panels if my hazy memory serves me right. But not 80's porn wooden panels. \n\nSo to sum up: shattered phone, lost suit jacket, friendly bartender and owner, nice interior, and good steaks (especially at happy hour prices).\n\nVegas."
16821,2,"I didn't go into the Lounge as it was closed so my friends and I were just outside chilling at the bar. The bartender was super friendly, upbeat and recommended a rather delicious raspberry drink. $15 a drink (other friend got jager and redbull). \n\nCool environment, comfy chairs. Maybe I'll venture in some time."
17939,2,"Lunch is not so great\n\nI went with one of our sales guys to a conference last week at LV.  He booked us a lunch reservation at the Tableau having just eaten there for dinner the night before.  He was raving about it, but after we finished lunch there, he reluctantly admitted that it wasn't great and that dinner was much better.  We had clam chowder, which was OK; the bits of celery were unconventional, and quite frankly, not that good.  I had a pepper fennel crusted ahi tuna, where again, the cracked fennel seeds were an unconventional topping for tuna and overwhelmed the tuna's delicate taste.\n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful and elegant, a great place to go for a romantic meal, or to impress a client.  It was also quiet with not much foot traffic - a rarity in LV.  So I'd be willing to go back there, but only to try their dinner menu."
10920,4,"This happy hour is like a two hour trip to Hawaii. At a $6 price point for island infused cocktails, mahi-mahi taco's and bbq pulled pork, arrive on an empty stomach. I have dreams about their pineapple martini's. Their sushi rolls are reason enough to veer off of the strip."
15191,3,"I was I  Vegas for a nursing conference September 18, 2013.  We were on the strip, so my friends decided they wanted to eat at the Bellagio.  After walking around the hotel we settle on eating at The Noddle.  I must admit the food was a lot better than I expected.  I ordered the shrimp pad thai.  The dish was very ,very good; much better than I expected for a strip Asian restaurant.  My friends ordered a couple of different soup/noodle dishes.  They were also goo, but the beef was slightly over-cooked.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  This was a great place to eat after all the exploring and people watching on the strip!"
11046,2,"If you are a Vikings fan... this is the bar for you.  I'm not but my husband is.  (Go Giants!) The bar itself is filled with Minnesota pictures, sports memorabilia and food.  You can smoke in the entire restaurant so it has that certain smell.   \n\nAs far as the menu, you can order the Minnesota Twin burger, the Kirby Puckett, the Timber Wolf French Dip and even Walleye.  There is a great variety of food since it is open 24/7. We ordered the Triple Decker Club and the Chicken Sandwich.  Crinkle cut french fries accompany the meals.  There were 6 of us and decided to get the homemade potato chips.  These are pretty darn good! Not healthy by any means but tasty!  My sandwich was good but I would just say good... not great.  The chicken sandwich was not chicken breast but ground chicken.  The hubby would say it was just ok and not really what he expected.   We have ordered the chicken fingers in the past and those are easily split between two people.  Huge portion and very filling.  \n\nOur waitress did an amazing job.  She was funny, kept the drinks coming and chatted with us for a bit.   So the service was great.  \n\nWe have tried to come here on a Sunday to watch the game and it's packed!  If you want a seat, get there early....   I was surprised actually by how many Vikings fans are here in Vegas.  \n\nAll in all, it is a great place for games or after a night of drinking and need some greasy food to fill the stomach.  Probably would give them 3.5 if I could."
49391,4,"Can you say delicious? Everything, from the salsa choices and the guac, to the street tacos (we had the all pastor) and all the entrees was amazing. And then there was the flan. I'm picky about that. Creamy, rich, smooth, and obviously carefully and freshly made. And churros too! The drinks were pretty fabulous, and worth the price. We'll be back for sure."
2867,1,"Saigon Pho Falls Flat\n\nYears ago, my husband and i went to Saigon Pho regularly before choir practice to get a bowl of Bun Hanoi.  Once we quit the choir, and found Cyclo, Saigon Pho was no longer on the radar screen.  Last night, i craved a bowl of pho, and wanting to mix it up a bit, we thought we'd visit the old haunt.\n\nWell, disappointing.  The Pho Tai was flat in flavor, greasy and very, very average.  the \""salad\"" consisted of a handful of bean sprouts, a lemon wedge, one basil leaf (!) and a sickly branch of couple day old mint leaves.  \n\nIt was sustenance, but not a great food treat.  \n\nwe'll be moving on."
44712,3,"Delicious. Great food, we have never had a bad dish."
41351,4,"Heard about this place in Vegas Seven, and had to try it. I'm so glad I did!\n\nI went with my boyfriend and he got the pulled pork sandwich with the bacon potato salad. I got the 2 plate combo with brisket and pulled pork, and yams as the side. We got a free dessert for checking in and got the banana pudding. It was awesome! \n\nEverything was delicious! Best BBQ I've had in Vegas. Service is great too. We talked to the chef for a little while we ate and he was really friendly. We'll be back :)"
34417,2,Flew round trip between PHL and Las Vegas on US Airways.\n\nFlight to Vegas was on time but the flight going back to PHL was delayed by about a half hour. Did not affect me much but others with connecting flights were pulling their hair out. Both flights were overbooked (hate when they do that).\n\nBy the time we got to board both flights of our trip the overhead compartments were FULL so we had to check our carryon luggage. Thankfully there was no charge. Our actual checked bags on the other hand were 25 bucks a bag because we booked last January. I think it's even more now. At least in Vegas they asked ahead of time if we wanted to check our carryons for free well in advance of boarding. In PHL we were almost on the plane when they yanked our carryons away from us. \n\nI like non-stop flights and US Airways seems to have them at the best times to fly. Would have liked to upgrade to first class but they have such a limited number on their Airbus planes. Like 4 rows? 16 seats? come on.\n\nEnded up buying a fruit and cheese platter on the flight. Fresh yes but not even close to being worth 8 bucks.

F\u00fcr Kinder, magers\u00fcchtige Models oder diats\u00fcchtige mag die ja ausreichen. Wie aber ein normaler Mensch davon satt werden soll, ist mir ein R\u00e4tsel. Ich jedenfalls war anschlie\u00dfend noch bei einem Chinesen f\u00fcr einen zweiten Gang."
30200,3,"I eat here often.  I love Town Square and Johnny McGuire's is a great sandwich shop in the heart of the shopping center.\n\nI normally get the Johnny, but this time I wanted to try the Bearcat sandwich.....which has Turkey, Bacon, Peppers, Cole Slaw, 1000 Island Dressing, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions.  It was very tasty, but also very messy.  The dressing and slaw were falling out of the sandwich....but it was good!\n\nAlso had a bag of the homemade chips....those are the best when their hot and fresh.\n\nWill I come back?  Absolutely!"
14384,3,"I like Cibo better than Bianco as a restaurant, but Chris's pie is still better by a nose. Cibo has bad parking, nice ambience, spotty service, good menu, fresh, high quality ingredients, and good value. Translates to hit the off hours, get a pie, order the antipasto, and have a Nutella desert"
33714,4,"I'm a HUGE fan of Coach products. I love their handbags, their wallets, their rings, their sunglasses, and even their shoes. I try to buy at the outlets, but sometimes I just have to buy at the retail boutique if something catches my eye.\n\nStephen will say that I never pass an opportunity to walk inside a Coach boutique. Today was no exception, and I was greeted warmly by the sales girls. \n\nThey try to find sunglasses to replace my scratched up once, but no such luck. Then they tried to sell me, of course, a new handbag. I could not find the perfect one for me. \n\nThen we were discussing wallets, and they had the one I was looking for. They even offered to look up my 25% discount that their marketing department has sent me, and I left at home on my kitchen table.\n\nGood thing I am in their computer system, they found my discount code immediately, and my wallet was practically a steal at $103. \n\nAs I was walking out the store, another hand bag caught my eye, and I groaned that I should have waited to use my discount coupon. The sales girl smiled and said she would honor the coupon code if I really wanted the handbag. Unfortunately it didn't have in enough pockets, so I passed on it. I walked out the store, waving to the Coach girlfriends, :-) with my new wallet."
42909,3,"Dropped by for lunch on an early Saturday afternoon. Only one other table of guests there, but considering how new they are, that wasn't surprising. The server we had was obviously new to the job, but she did well.\n\nOrdered the Ma Po Tofu and the Baked Pork and Rice with Portuguese sauce. Both dishes tasted good.\n\nThis restaurant is a good place to try some Hong Kong \""western\"" style dishes. They are a very good east side of town alternative to the wealth of Chinese restaurants on Spring Mountain Rd."
4732,2,Pho Kim long took a pho Kim long time to bring us our food.  Food was very ok.  Nothing to write home to mom about...\nWould come here again because of the name....
42888,2,"Went here tonight with the family. It isn't bad, however it isn't my favorite. \n\nHad the beef brisket platter with garlic mashed potatoes and jalapeno cole slaw. The brisket was decent. The potatoes were lumpy which I liked, however they were dry and I didn't taste garlic. Now the cole slaw on the other hand was delicious. It wasn't overly saturated with mayo, nor was it sweet. Should I come back, I will be ordering two sides of the cole slaw. \n\nThe prices seem a bit high compared to their competitors."
18691,0,"To start, you know if you're going to Dominos that you're not expecting amazing pizza. You're just expecting to get pizza that reminds you of being a kid.....nostalgically delivered to your doorstep. The pizza is edible and it's quite like riding a moped (fun unless you get caught by your foodie-friends). I must say though, even with such low expectations of the food....the customer service at this location is downright TRAGIC!  I was actually told when I telephoned about my pizza being exceptionally late \""we don't want you as a customer anyways\"". I wouldn't put my hard earned cash here....Who wants mediocre food AND crappy customer service?"
20236,0,"I was soooo disappointed :( I had high hopes for this place. I lived in Chicago for a few years and was happy to learn there was a Chicago style pizza place. Sadly, it does not compare to the pizza I would eat in Chicago. The sauce on the stuffed pizza tasted like it was just tomato sauce out of a can. There was absolutely NO seasoning in it. The spinach was fresh, but it wasn't completely covered by the sauce, so many of the pieces were dried out. The cheese was okay, but not great. The crust was pretty nondescript. I definitely won't get another stuffed pizza from here. If they use the same \""sauce\"" on the thin pizzas I definitely won't get pizza from here again."
45830,2,"In the Harris Teeter shopping center adjacent to Sun City Carolina Lakes construction is complete. There has been a great spirit of anticipation that this pan-Asian bistro is coming to town and today, May 15th it opened.\n\nRed Bowl is well known in the greater Charlotte area for the varieties and quality of food, so having one adjacent to Sun City will surely make this new location a success.\n\nWife and I went for lunch and will go again tonight for dinner.  Wait staff, as expected, was a bit slow and confuses, but if you look at the ENORMOUS menu that is excusable.  They did OK.\n\nThe food was just fine.  We sampled a won ton soup, pork fried rice and walnut shrimp and they were as advertized and were good.  Will check out more as time goes on.\n\nIf you have not tried Red Bowl, please do so as they offer a superb variety all under one roof."
28246,3,"So, having two sets of visitors coming two weekends in a row, I had the chance to visit first Stirling and then Edinburgh Castle.  And you know, I am going to slightly downgrade Edinburgh.  It has the advantage of being in a richly historical city that would be worth a visit even without the castle.  The castle itself also deeply impressive from afar, looming up from a dramatic cliffside (of course, that was just good strategy back in the day).\n\nBut...once inside, all that big bold castley-ness doesn't quite live up to its promise.  The Crown Jewels room is an interminable labyrinth of rooms with creepy mannequins.  When you finally get to the crown jewels they are just meh, although the seat of destiny is pretty excellent just because of its storied past.  The whole place is a bit disney-esque and commercial.  \n\nA few things do stand out.  The views are spectacular.  St. Margaret's chapel resonates with 900 years of history.  There are no fussy mannequins in there, just a real sense of place in this modest, contemplative room.  And the Royal Apartments are pretty interesting.\n\nAll that being said--what are you going to do, NOT go to Edinburgh Castle?  Don't be daft.  Like the Blue Lagoon in Reykjavik and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, you have to visit the city's signature landmark before you can do anything else.  And combined with the Princes Street Gardens, the Royal Mile, Holyood and Arthur's Seat, this does make for part of a very historical and beautiful day out."
9752,3,"Once you sift your way through all the Smith's shopping carts you find a pretty good little place, and it beats battling for parking on Spring Mountain, and the noisiness of Nobu.  We would come here special or no special (though the 2 for 1 Asahi nights is enough reason right there), but it's always fresh - plus they have oysters!  Decor could use an update yes, but you find yourself too busy stuffing your face to notice.\n\nAt least we were able to order our sushi directly at the counter (we didn't see our server too often - one more on to help couldn't hurt), and they did us a few special requests that other places didn't.   Don't forget your stamp card, we've gone through two!"
29524,1,"I'm surprised to read that others thought the staff was friendly. In fact, the rudeness of the owner is the only reason I felt compelled to write this review. The food is good, if you can wait...sometimes 20 minutes before your order is even taken. I'm pretty sure the owner is the only person that works there, as he is the only one I see when I stop there (I practically work right across the street, so it's convenient). Since he is the only one who works there, he takes and order then goes and prepares it himself. This obviously takes FOREVER. And it would be fine if it was a small place, but there's got to be a dozen or more full size booths there plus some tables. Today when I was there during a slight rush of 3 or 4 groups of people trying to buy food, he became visibly flustered and I heard him say things to shaking his head at waiting customers saying things like \""when you decide what you want, let me know...I can't just stand here and wait,\"" \""Hold on, I can't help you right now\"" - and he's not saying these with a smile on his face to lighten the mood. He's just plain mean to his customers. When he brought me my food after about 30 minutes of waiting, he put the food down and then walked to the door and stuck his head outside to yell at someone for parking in front of his place and going to Saigon Noodles next door. Granted, he still had people waiting after me for food yet he felt it was necessary to yell at someone for not respecting his parking spaces. When clearly, he can barely handle the customers that where already there. He needs to HIRE SOMEONE, and I pity the person that has to work with him..."
9913,1,"I think we just went on an off day. The scary part was entirely closed. It said someone would be back at 6.45, but it was after then and there was no one around. The photographers were completely ignoring us, so my mum and I couldn't get a picture with us both in it, and the bar was unstaffed. The main parts I wanted to see were Lady GaGa (which I did) and the scary part (nope), and we could only take pictures of each other, not one with both, so it was kind of a bust.\nI do like that you are free to touch and pose with all the wax figures, though. \nI'd go back again and give it another shot."
15539,3,tip: 15 minute wait on a packed morning is super efficient.\n\nbreakfast crepes were out of the ordinary.  it's basically an omelet wrapped in a crepe; a must try.  too much home style potatoes.  good coffee.  flip the happy face egg to a sad face egg for prompt service.

47557,3,"Fresh margaritas made to order, not too sweet- best I've had this side of the Caribbean! Tacos are money as well- fish and shrimp were my favorite. 4 stars because steak tacos were over cooked and guacamole needs more flavor."
2715,1,"All of our food had a hint of Italian seasoning, which was strange and unappealing.  The veggie enchilada is chock full of zucchini (the menu just said veggie, and I had anticipated the usual peppers and onions...if you love zucchini, get the veggie enchilada and a side of Mexican veggies - also just zucchini - unfortunately I really don't like zucchini!).  All around the place is nice, service was friendly, but the food just wasn't good."
30255,1,"After a week of attending this yoga studio, I was no longer able to ignore my loudly-clanging bullshit detector, and had to quit. Nothing personal against this particular franchise...my beef is with Bikram yoga in general. Doing a Bikram class feels like working out at the Jonestown Athletic Club!\n\nBikram devotees strike me as slightly brainwashed in their adherence to the cult of Bikram. This is reinforced at the end of every class, when everyone utters a monotone \""Namaste\"" in unison, while laying flat on the floor with heels touching and palms out. Heaven's Gate, anyone? \n \nAnother thing I found creepy is that the instructors are required to recite pretty much word-for-word from a script. Funny quips and jokes are more robotic, less funny when you've heard them over and over (\""Japanese ham sandwich\""). They also have to repeat Bikram's mangled English (\""Put your exactly forehead to your knee\""). Exactly forehead? WTF is that?\n \nI'm not blaming the instructors -- it's Bikram himself (Bikram Choudhury, who devised this regimen in the early '70s) who insists that all his franchisees follow his shtick TO THE LETTER if they want to keep teaching. Yes that's right -- FRANCHISEES; it's a freakin' FRANCHISE that will set you back $10,000 and then $1,000 a month. That's in addition to the $10,500 fee for taking the required instructors' course. Think of all the Bikram studios across the U.S. The humble yogi is raking it in!\n \nWell, at least he's honest about it. Direct quote from Bikram: \""Bikram yoga is so big. This is a bathroom slipper you buy (for) $2 in Kmart. But you put Bikram on it, it'll sell for $35 in a second.\"" I'll give him props for his balls. Oh, speaking of his balls, here's another direct quote: \""I'm beyond Superman. I have balls like atom bombs, two of them, 100 megatons each. Nobody fucks with me.\""\n \nIndeed, back in 2000 he sued a couple of yoga techers in CA for teaching a modified version of Bikram (they had the audacity to add music and lower the thermostat in the room from the sacrosanct 105 degrees, 40% humidity). The case was settled out of court.\n \nIn addition to these ethical quibbles, I'm not so sure about the health benefits of doing a strenuous workout in a 105-degree room. They say I will sweat out all the \""toxins\"" in my system. As far as I know, sweat is just salt and water. I didn't see any booze, shrooms or trans fats rolling down my face.\n \nI was going to finish my 30-day trial membership at Bikram Yoga Summerlin, just to give it a fair shake. Maybe I'd end up getting over my reservations, lose 10 pounds, become more grounded, and be able to sleep well again....??? \n \nThen I came to my senses and went back to Las Vegas Athletic Club... which costs me $9/month and offers a variety of un-copyrighted, unpretentious yoga classes. Holla!"
7277,4,"I have NEVER had such a great experience ordering flowers. This is truly customer service at its highest level. Tony did a fantastic job helping me to order flowers for my girlfriend and at such last minute as well. NOT only did he provide excellent service, he made a special run to the grocery store to purchase an add-on item I wanted to send her. \nWOW!! I am truly impressed with their great service and help."
14375,1,"It's hard to write a review for a restaurant that is loved by so many others as an Elite Yelper, and have to give it a \""Meh\"" review. Cibo initially won me over with its great atmosphere, fantastic hosts and delicious appetizers, but it did not last. Be prepared for a lengthy review because I'd really like to describe my experience in full.\n\nI wound up at Cibo with a decent-sized group (12 total, I believe), and everything started off great; the drinks began flowing and the appetizer was being passed around for all to share. The process for ordering was a little slow, but busy Friday night, large table...no biggie. I completely understood, and we kept ourselves busy with conversation. After a bit we got our entr\u00e9e orders in and everyone went with pizzas, and not 10 minutes later, they began to arrive.\n\nNow, being the first visit for me, I decided to ask for recommendations. That's just what I like to do because I like to hear a server get really excited about one of their favorite dishes. For the white pizzas, our server suggested the Di Notte. I was instantly sold, so much so that I asked for a suggestion on the red pizzas. He then mentioned the Capricciosa, and after a brief chat between him, my girlfriend and myself (Important Note: about the artichokes on the pizza), I told him that we'd take it.\n\nGoing back to the arrival of the pizzas...they came out staggered, which made sense since there is only one pizza oven. We all began sharing as each pie came out, and life was good. First we got our Di Notte (a delicious mix of cheese and spicy salami) which was cooked perfectly and tasted great! A little later, after other pie orders began filling the table, came a vegetarian. The runners are slammed, and they just call out the names of the pizzas and wait for a hand to be raised. Not really hearing the name correctly, I asked if that was the pizza with the artichokes. The runner said yes, and I took the pizza (Note: I was the only one at the table that had artichokes on my pizza). This all brings me to the most awkward moment at a restaurant for me in a very long time. \n\nWe decided to wait on touching the vegetarian pizza because we thought the runner just delivered to the wrong table. It happens, and I was totally ready to hand that pie over unscathed. But when our server came back and I mentioned the potential mistake, he told me that was what I ordered and continued to repeat it over and over. This was an embarrassing situation mostly because I took HIS recommendation because it was my first visit, and we had never even mentioned the \""Vegetariana,\"" and because during the conversation we were having the whole table fell silent (funny little extra - the musician just started his break as well...complete silence). He caused a scene even after I had told him it was alright and we'd just take the pizza because it was a mistake. I tried not to place any blame and talked to him with a \""this happens\"" kind of demeanor, but he insisted that that's what we ordered...PLUS he said that he specifically remembered us ordering that because we weren't interested in artichokes. Guess what's on the Vegetariana, folks? Yep. Artichokes. A whole fourth of the pizza was covered in them (I love artichokes, by the way. This posed no problem.). Once that was pointed out, instead of any sort of apology, he decided to explain how the artichokes were only on one \""quadrant\"" of the pizza. C'mon now...I can see a bullshitter, and that was just blatant. It's ridiculous to claim that we ordered a different pizza because of one particular ingredient only to order another with the SAME ingredient. I hope you, the reader, is understanding the uncomfortable situation that I was in because it was a weird one. I kind of couldn't wait to get out of there for the remainder of the dinner.\n\nThat all being said, the woman at the cash bar, Melissa, was great, and she really made an effort to make our table feel a little more comfortable after the whole incident. I hope the owner of Cibo can take note of that because it wasn't really her job, but she was sweet, personable and took it upon herself to feel embarrassed and responsible for our server.\n\nMy first trip to Cibo was a bust, and it's really hard to want to make a return visit, but in time I'm sure I will. I can't let one bad experience dictate how I completely feel about such a beloved local restaurant. Sorry for the length, but I hope this review can be of help to someone. The food and the atmosphere was good, but my experience with the service totally overshadowed them."

13469,1,Its the Hard Rock Hotel cafe.  You eat here because its convenient.  They charge in accordance of that.
22792,2,"The entrees were really good and the bread was fluffy and tasty. However, I found the calamari and cheesecake dessert rather bland. The batter on the calamari didn't have any taste an relied somewhat on the natural flavor of the squid, which isn't alot. And the cheesecake lacked sweetness and needed additional sugar. \n\nStill the atmosphere was good and the service was exceptional. Still it was hard to make up or the cost of the calamari and cheesecake."
10155,1,"Tried to have dinner at the bar, the menu is very limited and the bartender and servers do not really care if you eat at the bar or not. Behind the bar are a number of signs that tells the customers what they cannot have or cannot do. This attempts to be a neighborhood eatery, but without the neighbor in mind. Now for the food, ordered a chicken parm, asked for a side of pasta, was told no substitutes, it came with a lame version of creamed spinach. Tomato sauce just OK, not really memorable."
24912,3,"I came here last time I was in Vegas, and I came back again cause it is that good!! I don't actually eat burgers lol, so my review is really focusing on the milk shakes.  I've had the mother fluffer both times I came now and it is so freaking delicious.  My husband had the lunch box milkshake and he loved it too.\n\nI had the Caesar salad for actually food - it was good, nothing unbelievable.  My husband had the classic burger and also said it was good but not the best ever.\n\nThe milk shakes are so good though, and so are the fries, so go for those and you will be happy!!"

18006,4,"Now this must be how movie heaven feels like. As a pauper =( having the opportunity to enjoy the experience a couple times a year does it for me. It's first class seats and service for a mere $15 for a movie ticket, then add on drinks and an appetizer, and you end up spending close to $40. Not bad, especially if it's a real big blockbuster movie, then it makes it more worth it. check it out, it's awesome."
39221,4,this place was amazing the food was great and not that expensive. It was super cool how Chef Carlos came out to introduce himself and after we were done with our meal he came out just to make sure everything was ok.. The burger was nice and juicy. My wife had a chopped steak and that was great the mashed potatoes were good and the steak was juicy and cooked to perfection. This is going to be our new weekly place to eat.
25479,2,"The decor was very pretty and the food was tasty. We had some kind of duck and spicy avocado roll served in 4 slices looking like sushi as a starter; it was delicious. The pad thai was good, but the shrimps were bland. For dessert, we had the chocolate souffl\u00e9, which was good. The reason why the place is just OK is that the portions are really small for the price--especially for starter and dessert. Also, the service was a bit slow."
36501,1,"Well, I would love to say I could share the same glossy review of this place as many of the other people. I love NODA so I hate to bash any business there, but.... This service in this place SUCKS!!! I had actually gotten the same review from a friend that has been there 3-4 times. I always like to give any place my own personal review form my own experience there. Well, we walked into Growlers around 9:30pm on a Tuesday night, and we got one of 3 available tables left. Our party of 3 people sat for nearly 20 minutes and didn't get any service the whole time!- A guy from behind the bar walked out to 2 other tables and even made direct eye contact with us and quickly glanced away and continued to ignore us! They were not busy at all, and there were 2 servers and 1-2 people behind the bar! Bad day or not, I have alot of friends in the food/drink service industry, and taking care of customers are the only real way you are gonna bring home any money. We weren't looking for pen pals or facebook buddies, we just wanted a freakin drink! The NODA area in Charlotte is just not the place for snobby establishments with servers that only like to cater to thier \""regulars\"" or friends (especialy a newer business that is trying to make it). Anyways, I heard good things about thier beer selection and good food. Too bad my first experience lived up to the crappy service rumors."
8614,1,Other than a couple waitresses with big jugs this place doesn't have much to offer. The food is bland and over priced. Only positive thing I can say is that that they warm up their muffins.
40564,3,"I'm sorry to read that other locations of Aspen Dental in the Valley have had such bad experiences. I started going to the new office at 44th Street and Thomas Road (in Arcadia Crossing) about a year and a half ago, and I have been extremely happy with them.\n\nI recently had my third cleaning done, and I have never had dental technicians who have taken such good care of me. My teeth are very close together and very hard to get clean, and I have had many seriously rotten experiences in the past -- not so here! My technician is consistently gentle, considerate, and very supportive. \n\nDr. Sang (I believe; or Song? Shame on me) is friendly and likewise gentle and caring. He fixed a filling for me between cleaning appointments and I have had no trouble at all since. \n\nThe team at the Arcadia Crossing Aspen Dental are always smiling, always friendly. This last time was even the first time I'd had to wait for more than a few minutes, and they were VERY apologetic that they'd kept me waiting at all.\n\nI'm overjoyed to have found a dentist at long last who doesn't berate me for having teeth set close together, or cut my gums flossing. Two thumbs up."
47829,3,"I like this place a lot! It's really close to my house and they are open late. The atmosphere is nice, music good and staff are friendly. The drinks are a little pricey but I think it's worth it. As I am writing this review, I have only been here twice. I got the Pistachio Latte both times because it's amazing! Not overly sweet which is a huge plus. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that the last time I was there, I was sweating heaps because their heater was on really high. It didn't help that I had a hot drink to make it worse. I was dying to get out of there asap but pushed through, although, complaining about it the whole time.  I am hoping it isn't always like this. I like being warm but not to the point that I can't wait to get out of the place!\n\nI'll be back again. I really wanna try their dessert. I've seen pictures of their waffles and toast and it looks delicious!"
48823,1,"I hate to say it, but a giant Ferris wheel ride overlooking a city used to be a novelty, but with more and more of them being built, they are becoming a one and done type deal. \n\nHaving ridden the London Eye, the High Roller, is a nice knock off that has made some improvements, especially on the pod design.\n\nPrice:\n\nPricing varies. There are a handful of options, i.e. Happy Hour, Resident Discount Day, Daytime/Nighttime , etc. I would look for discount tickets and not pay full price for the experience.\n\nView:\n\nThe view is some what boring. I wouldn't say that you have the best view of the strip as it is off back by the monorail a little ways from the Flamingo. I felt that you get better views if you visit Paris' Eiffel Tower\n\nPod:\n\nThe pod does have two benches to sit, but the number of seats are limited. Depending on who your with, as the can hold 20+ people, it can feel tight and the people you are with can be a bit of a pain to deal with for 30+ minutes. You are also held captive to the stupid video with an annoying host. Some of the facts are interesting, but there is no mute button.\n\n\nTips:\n\n- Best spot to stand for the best view is once you enter, is on the right side near where you enter the pod\n\n-Tune your flash off on you camera/phone, and if after the ump-tenth time your picture ends up blurry, you might just want to give up and enjoy the ride\n\n- Go to the bathroom prior to getting in line. They do have a small one behind the drink counter prior to entering the ticket scanning line."

36811,1,"My fianc\u00e9 and I were walking down the strip with my sister and decided to get a drink. We passed this place and I decided I wanted to try it because of the fire on the tables. Yeah, that was a deciding factor for me lol. My fianc\u00e9 got an adios mother fuc*er and my sister and I got a strawberry daiquiri. My fianc\u00e9s drink was strong and well work the money while my sister and I's drinks were just overpriced slushies. Pretty disappointing since it was my sister's first drink ever and because I can get buzzed off of an 8oz. glass of wine. My fianc\u00e9 even asked the waitress if there was any alcohol or if it was a virgin. According to her, it had 10%, same as a beer. I get buzzed off of a beer so they must have forgotten to put the alcohol in. Pretty disappointing. We won't be returning unfortunately."
19748,0,"My boyfriend works in this shopping center and he likes deli food so I went to vons to get him some cheap bean and cheese burritos in the deli section- I was going to get a fresh sandwich made because I am not totally into the fried deli food and the menu actually looked pretty good--- turkey pesto something I don't remember.  ANYWAYS. I was standing at the counter watching the two employees do EVERYTHING but their job in helping me. Like literally probably close to 5 minutes \n\nPretty upset and annoyed I called my boyfriend and he told me that this was \""pretty typical\"" and that ordering food from the deli section seemed to be a HUGE inconvenience for them. And they are generally very rude needless to say  i didn't buy any thing from them."
35046,3,I've been going to this office for about 2 years now and each experience I've had has been a positive one. The staff is fabulous and I've never had a problem getting in for an appointment when it's time for my checkup.
7732,0,"Horrible!!!!!! All I got to say. I had just a pedi/Mani done with gel. After having to endure the painful pedicure and the \""lack\"" of foot rub.. Not to mention that I paid for a sea salt scrub, she out hardly put any salt scrub.. Painful! Now my natural nails are a decent length..He cut them down with out asking????? The sign said \""30 for Mani pedi and 15 for gel\"" my total was 65??? Why? No one would give me an answer! She just punched the total in the calculator that said 65. I get my nails done religiously every two weeks. I go to angelic nails on Valvista and warner they are amazing, give you water, talk to you and don't cause pain My total is always consistent 45 for Mani pedi and gel. Don't go here nails of the world unless you want to be broke"
17602,4,"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and certainly worthy of the Iron Chef.  The decor is kool, without trying too hard - and the food is absolutely fabulous. \n\nIf you're looking for a full-flavored dish, try the spaghetti and meatballs - they are to die for good.  Made with organic tomatoes and hefty, beefy orbs...delicious."
26376,3,"Montesano's is a friendly, authentic trattoria and more.  It is also a deli, pasta shop, and first-rate emporium of memorable baked dessert treats.  A server was slow to take our order, based on some initial confusion over who was assigned our booth.  But, once that hiccup was alleviated, all was well.  She was a fine server, but I would have liked to have been informed of the dinner specials like Lobster Parm I later saw on a board.  A sign inside the restaurant reads \""Where love has a taste!\"" and diners are reminded by another placard to be patient because all food here is cooked to order.  I found great taste in these environs, and the freshly prepared food well worth the wait. \n\nI was initially surprised to see that dinners are served here with complimentary freshly baked garlic knots and bread.  Then the surprise turned to shock when the bread and basted knots were placed on the table.  There were 24 Garlic Knots--for only 2 diners!  They were small, but so what?  The doughy knots were warm and quite tasty, and the huge number made up for their diminutive size.  A dozen accompanied us home.\n\nI was less impressed by the fresh but earthy Italian bread.  It was sort of dry, and not that tasty.  But this was a minor setback.  For the Stracciatella (Italian Egg Drop) Soup was the best I have ever had: really hot and tasty broth, and chockfull of spinach and egg whites.  An immense \""Caesars Salad\"" with one anchovy as requested, chopped Romaine, Romano Cheese, and fresh croutons was very good but almost overdressed with too much Creamy Caesar Dressing.  \n\nA Shrimp Cocktail featured 8 large shrimp that were good but tasted like they had recently been defrosted.  But I harbored no reservations at all concerning my entree of delectable Veal Montesano over Fettuccine, which was simply superb.  This very creative dish featured nicely pounded and tender, hand sliced, and lightly floured milk-fed veal medallions, artichoke hearts, fresh garlic, roasted potatoes, and roasted red peppers, and was finished in a delicate white wine and butter sauce in a brick oven.  The fragile artichoke petals gave the sauce a welcome hint of lemony flavoring.  And the fresh pasta undergirding the veal was cooked perfectly!  The whole edible conglomeration represented a delicious and very nice blend of harmonizing flavors.\n\nBut I was by no means done, because a lovely, large \""Black & White Cookie\"" in the display case had caught my eye when I entered the restaurant.  I went back to get a good second look, and then ordered it for dessert.  The unusual cookie, freshly baked on premises, was composed of pound cake topped by vanilla icing on one half, and chocolate icing on the other, and was moist and delectable.  The pure vanilla and chocolate flavors startled my taste buds.  Diane's novel idea of biting down on the black and white border to take in both flavors at once was a definite winner.  And, that lovely cookie was so rich that half of it accompanied me home, and even that amount lasted two more lunches!  \n\nAffable owner/chef Steven Montesano, attired mostly in red, flitted in and out of the kitchen, watched the front of the house, and came over to our booth to check on us a few times during the course of our meal.  He was a very cordial and accommodating host, and it is obvious that he takes great pride in his fine cooking and baking.  Deservedly so!\n\n4-1/2 stars overall!"
13886,3,"Call ahead and get on the guest list.  My group of 5 girls and 2 guys all got in for free because of it (but you still have to wait in line for about an hour like the rest of the people on the guest list).  \n\nThe first time I went to Tao, I was severely disappointed.  It was really small and the music was mediocre at best.  Second time I went I was wary because of my initial visit there but I actually really enjoyed myself.  It was still a small area but the music was better and it's always entertaining seeing the girls covered only in flower petals.  \n\nThis third time I went (on a Friday night), Tao was fantastic!! The music was literally the best I've ever had in a night of clubbing.  I seriously wish I could follow those DJ's around and club wherever they're going to play.  A con was the crowded-ness.  It is extremely frustrating when you love the song that's playing but can't dance to it because the coupleS next to you are bumpin and grindin and makin out violently which results in you getting pushed around and trampled.  Once we made it on to the side stage I was as happy as can be!"
11440,1,"I've been to this one and the one in Green Valley and I have to say that I'm just not that impressed.  I mean, the food is good and its certainly a nice enough place but I like the food at China-a-go-go better, and its a hell of a lot cheaper.  \n\nI guess this place is fine for high school graduations, Mothers Day, and dad's birthday, you know, when you want to go out for a \""nice\"" dinner (but not an overly expensive one).  \n\nThe staff was nice and took good care of us but I left here not caring either way if I ever returned."
3475,4,"These guys are great! Kelly and mark are always professional and I always refer my customers to them.  Especially for classic cars. But, they do all makes body shop repairs! Thanks guys for helping me out! See you next time my truck needs fixed."
37679,2,"Despite a previous review, The sis, kids and myself checked out the monkey Joes on woodlawn and were greeted by a very friendly hostess and for 4 bucks were able to bring a 2 yr old and 1 year old in.  There are about 7 inflatable \""moon walks\"" with 5 of them having slides or having easily maneuverable climbing walls for the 2 year old.  My only complaint was we were told two different things by different employees concerning the 1 year old we brought.  While sliding down the slide with her an employee said that we had to not go down with her.  This proved problematic since she lacks the strength to pull her body up the climbing walls.  So eventually it clarified with the manager and we were able to assist her on the rides.  Overall, Great time and will go back when they visit again!  So, check it out if you have a lil one, I doubt they'd be disappointed... after all, it's more about them, than it is us!"
5803,4,Loved the atmosphere and the beer. Great place to meet up with friends and have some good beer and food!
399,0,"I almost hate writing this review, because Green's is such a Charlotte institution. I almost feel like I'm dissing my adopted city by saying this, but I just don't see what the big deal is about this place. When I first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as The Varsity in Atlanta. News tip: they aren't, and they aren't by a longshot. What's worse, the three or four times I've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent. Maybe the hot dog is cold, but the chili is hot. I dunno... I WANT to like this place, but just can't."
46982,1,"(bald) Bartender, extremely rude. This review  would be too long if I listed our conversation. I spoke to a manager, about his \""treatment\"" toward us. The manager apologized and bought us a beer. That was nice of him but I hope the bartender will work on his \""people\"" skills. \n\nThe place wasn't very busy, an hour or so, after a Dbacks game. We didn't eat. I've heard good things about the food. Baldy Bartender put a downer on us wanting to stay longer.  I do like that they have a few tvs. There was no way that I was going to ask the bartender to change the station, lol."
17652,3,"Highly recommend this for anyone who wants a beautiful tour of the Grand Canyon.  The pilot we had was informative and funny.   The only downside of the tour was the time spent inside the canyon.   With all the awesome sights an additional 30 minutes would have been ideal.  It was difficult to go everywhere we wanted in the limited amount of time we had.  Other than that, I would say this is one great tour for anyone that would like to take a helicopter from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon."
40052,0,The poorest service I have experienced in Montreal .
48769,1,"I'm a great fan of anything Latin and was really excited to check out this Cuban inspired club/restaurant on Rose Street. I was sadly disappointed, as the club was far from full and there were quite a few dodgy characters there whom I suspect might be regulars.\n\nThe only thing I did like was the music, which was a mixture of hiphop, rnb, dancehall, latin and reggae! I do find it's really hard to get a DJ to play some Ricky Martin, but valiantly keep trying. They also claimed to serve food until around 3am, which seemed like a God send because I'm usually ravenous by this time. However, they disappointed me again saying the kitchen had closed! I pointed at their own sign in vain (and in desperation), but there'd be no food for me that night. Pity really."
25520,0,"Second only to the out-of-business Rajput, this was the most disappointing Indian we'd had in Montreal.\nOnly tried it because we had a group-buy coupon. \nWe ordered a Bhoona and Aloo Ghobi.  Both were bland, the latter, even more so.  The side of  basmati rice was overcooked! - no excuse for a restaurant so pricey to be serving overcooked rice. \nService was inattentive.  I noticed other diners waiting too long to have their orders taken & for the bill to come at the end.  \nThe decor was really lacking also.  \nI'm sure the Old Montreal tourists are the only ones keeping this establishment in business.  \nOnly positive thing I can say is that the music & views outside the windows were pleasant."
1985,3,"My hubby and his father \""fixed\"" the constant running of water from the guest bathroom toilet.  Funny, how it was running again after my FIL leaves.  I swear it was just story telling and drinking.  LOL!  Anyways, I told my hubby get it fix or sleep in the tub!  The running water was driving me crazy.  He found Johnco online and give them a call.  \n\nOur tech, Jason came out and fixed the issue.  On his way out, my hubby asked him about the leaking drip system and if he knew anyone to fix it.  He gave us 2 options.  We took the cutting off supply to the drip system, since we were not using it anyways.  \n\nAbout 1 day later the toilet was leaking water outside this time.  Oh boy, this is not good.  We called and left a message.  Then we call again the next day, they asked a series of questions.  They sent out the same tech.  He explained the issue and fix it for GOOD."
42359,3,"Came here post Xmas trip! \nFrom the outside this place looks like  a reg Irish pub, but if u ordered the food u wud know why this place is almost perfect score! \n\nHad the fish tacos! Am obsessed with those lately! It was huge!! And very filling! Two came per order along with a side salad(health!) and fries(my fave!!)!\n\nLove the sauce and guacamole! Had to ask for hot sauce coz I prefer my tacos with a bit of kick! \n\nMy bf had the spicy chicken burger with bacon! It wasn't the usual deep fried chicken with spicy sauce! It was slightly browned chicken drenched in this yummy spicy, tangy sauce! \n\nThe waitress was very attentive too! She reminded me of Shannon Doherty with a French accent!\n\nThey had a good selection of beer, a little on the pricier side in comparison to other places in Montreal but understandable as lots were imported beer! \n\nOverall, love this little dive! Definitely a must try!"
4870,0,"I have came to Little Darlings 4 different occasions and every time I was dissatisfied. I love entertainers and the technically of dancing. Yet, this is NOT the place to enjoy it. \nCover for locals is $17 and $33 for outsiders, includes soda beverages at the bar. I have attended by myself AND with friends. We all agreed that the size of the venue was great but the atmosphere depressing. The entire night seemed unorganized. The dancers walk/stand around with scrunched mean faces and uncomfortable body language. I noticed they only smile when approaching a customer to converse. That being said 3 out of the 4 times i attended, I was never approached. Little do the women know I have $200+ for someone with good conversation and a nice smile. Oh well. \n\nI think the top 2 buzz killers for me was the DJ and the Dancers. The music ranges from rock n' roll, 80s, to hip hop. I love the variety but the transitions are horrible and the in between songs are almost annoying. The DJ's voice sounds like he is at an auction and you can never hear what he is saying 90% of the time. I am a firm believer that the DJ controls the hype and atmosphere of a club. And unfortunately I was very bored and distant.\nThe dancers are average when it comes to the skill level. They know maybe 1 or 2 pole tricks then attempt to shake their butt to their chosen tune. The majority of the dancers are beautiful in their own way.Eh, I'd say there's only 1 woman that I enjoyed watching. Jackie was here name. She was smiling and flirting and used the entire stage during her performance! She made me smile and had my eyes locked. I moved closer and threw her a big tip, she came over and thanked me. Her breast were so soft ^_^} After her performance she came over to my chair and thanked me again. I tipped her a $20 bill then released her to make more money. Its very difficult to watch the other dancers on stage without my face being twisted. They are not entertaining nor look like they enjoy their job. Smh. I can't bare to return.\n\nI would recommend going to Lacey's. Full Nude Full Bar Strip club. Thursdays 9pm-4am Fridays-Saturdays 3am-7am This is the Hip Hop strip club of Las Vegas. 21+ $20 cover charge for all. IF YOU WANT AN ENTERTAINING STRIP CLUB WITH DRINKS, BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, AND GREAT MUSIC THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD BE!! Not Little Darlings"
7893,3,"If you are looking for any kind of obscure hat this is your place!  They have all kinds of hats here!  They even have stuff in storage that they can get if you need something that is 'out of season'.  \n\nI happened to walk in a few days after the Kentucky Derby and what a treat, so many amazing, beautiful, well-made hats!! I was there for another need, but wow, I almost wanted to buy a crazy derby hat...such COOL stuff!  \n\nThe sales associate was extremely helpful; you can tell they know their hats (any genre).  They are a bit on the expensive side, but nice well-made hats are pricey."
1139,4,"Awesome staff, great food and cool decor"
18015,1,"I've been here twice and will probably not go back. The first time I just sat at the bar and had a couple beers and some nachos. The nachos were average. The bar tender was super friendly and the service was pretty good.\n\nThe second time the waitress was a total space cadet. We got there and she brought some water over after about 15 minutes and then came and checked on us once every half hour after that. We were there a good 30 minutes before they put on the game we had requested. When we ordered our beer, she had no idea what we were talking about. The food we got was cold by the time it got to us. Even if it was hot, it still would have been sub-par.\n\nThe same \""regulars\"" were in there both times I've been there. They're a little bit loud and both times were visibly inebriated.\n\nThere are enough other bars in the area. I would avoid this one."
8118,0,"My mother always said to me \""If you don't have anything nice to say,then you should not say it.\"" Well sorry Mom ,not going to happen this time.  I joined some old friends for dinner at Don and Charlies at the recommendation of my friend's family. To be fair I am a \""foodie\"",so this might seem a little harsh.  . The first thing I received when I walked into the place was the smell of mold mixed with some industrial cleaner,probably the most pleasant  aroma that I had throughout the evening and of course the duct tape all over the old carpet was quite attractive..My server  informed us that she had worked there for 30 years..Wow. Unfortunately for her time here she couldn't answer  our questions very well. We asked about the  so-called Prime beef ,if that actually meant Prime Grade  Beef  she seemed dumbfounded and if it was wet or dry aged.Also inquired what was in the rice pilaf ( vegies,stock etc) still no definitive answer,what size were the shrimp . We were not trying to harass the server we  have some  dietary needs and we were trying to  get some entrees and appetizers  that we could all share.We decide on  the chopped liver,the rib appetizer and a couple of wedge salads,caesar,and a french onion soup to begin followed by salmon,New York ,prime Rib,BBq cicken,Bone in Rib eye and ,halibut. The ribs were not very meaty and extremely tough  probably the worst that I have ever had,,french onion tasted like knorr beef stock and liver..and we all love pate, was quite frankly disgusting. The steaks were ok but not prime grade the salmon was previously frozen  farm raised Atlantic salmon the deli cole slaw was decent the creamy tasted ok but exactly like the Colonel's The BBq chicken was gross.,Halibut was so-so. All and all  my review of the place would be outdated cuisine prepared without skill or love but with the same price points as high end steakhouses in the area. The place just looks old and tacky with ripped chairs, old smelly carpet,.crud stuck beneath the tables and servers who  are as antiquated as the establishment..Comfort food? Only if you are comfortable with ghetto crap food . Sorry Charlie (and Don)"
14082,3,"Thank you, thank you, thank you Food Fight Inc. for opening Market Street Diner in Sun Prairie.  It's just what the doctor ordered in this sleepy, food-deprived Madison 'burb.  The menu's a bit of a mix of their Monty's and Hubbard Street diners and overall the food and the service are good.  And, the desserts are GREAT - they've got more kinds of pie than I can even begin to list."
9905,2,"its a typical 3.5-star restaurant. Nothing special - even their famous beer is not that great anymore. \n\nIt doesnt mean their quality has fallen - today, we have a lot of restaurants/bar serving all kinds of beer from around the world. This makes G&B not so special anymore (it was 10 years ago).\n\nHowever, if you like watching basketball and football games, this is a place to go. They even have happy hours - you get $1 discount on all beers! Only a dollar but it counts. \n\nOther happy hour meals were like 5, 6, 7 dollars and they seem to be ok. I didnt order any of them - I dont order food based on the price. You live only once. Eat what you wanna eat. Then maybe you will get heart attack and die happily. Yes, food here is very greasy."
23386,4,"I recently took NCT's level 1 Improv Workshop and I LOVED it.  My first class I awkwardly sat on stage and nervously laughed and couldn't come up with anything.  By the end of the class, I was kung-fu-ing my way to rescue Princess Miyuki with a prince who still lived with his parents.\n\nThe class focuses on the basics of Improv - listening, \""yes, and\"", relationships, responding emotionally and staying rooted in reality.  Dorian was able to provide consistent guidance and constructive criticism to move me forward as an actor.  The other students are equally awesome, as everyone is at least some form of funny.  \n\nI would recommend (and do recommend!) everyone I know at least take a level 1 improv class, and I love the people at NCT.  The skills I've gained from 6 weeks of workshop have already helped me become a better listener and improviser at work, as well as with friends.  Looking forward to more Improv with NCT in the future!"

18409,1,"I started going to New Leaf in July 2012 after looking for Isolaz providers online. The site looked reputable and the office was close by. I called and explained I wanted to buy the Isolaz package which was $550. They sold me the package and I came in for my first visit. At that visit, there was some confusion in the office and ultimately they hadn't communicated that I was a new patient which requires a visit with the doctor. So, they got that taken care of and I talked to the doctor very briefly and they had me then do a session of Isolaz. I came in for my second session (after a lot of scheduling back and forth issues) and again had the Isolaz treatment. There was a lot of trouble again getting me in, but I came in for my third session and once I was in the room, they informed me that the Isolaz was broken with no ETA on fixing it. They let me know another laser would be used on me. The doctor wasn't available to explain to me the benefits of this laser or anything about it. I went ahead and had the treatment, but let them know I wanted to meet with the doctor again to understand the treatment plan/any changes to the plan. I am trying to solve and issue, not just come in for random laser treatments. At this point there was a ton of back and forth in terms of scheduling issues, me explaining the situation and them understanding why I felt I needed to see the doctor again, etc. It was so difficult I ended up just letting it be for a couple months. Then, I called back and we got the appointment set up. I explained I wanted to see the doctor so that he could hear the various issues I was having and provide me with the best treatment plan (instead of just sticking me under this or that laser). At that appointment, he just pushed doing the laser and I couldn't clearly get a plan. Microdermabrasion came up but he mentioned I'd have to talk to someone else about that and she wasn't there (she called me the next day but was confused about what I wanted and nothing was integrated). Also, a nurse came in to ask him something and all the sudden he was gone and on to another patient without answering all my questions or issues. I don't think I ever spent more than 3-5 minutes in a room with him. After that appointment I decided just to go elsewhere. I called and explained the situation again and asked for a refund for the remainder of my package. After calling twice, and no one ever calling me back, I just gave up and wrote the money off as a loss. Then, recently I got an office visit bill for them for the second appt with the doctor I wrote about above. Before I had this appointment, they assured me because of all the issues I wouldn't be charged a visit fee. This bill required I get back into the whole situation, so I called. The receptionist had me leave a message for someone else who didn't call me back. I called again, and then was called back. I was told due to the terms and conditions they could not provide a refund but only finish the laser treatments. I let them know I didn't want to come back, but that I wanted to clear up the other bill sent to me. She wasn't able to do anything about that, so I got the billing contact who I will call tomorrow and tell the story to again. Whew! So much time on the phone and complications. I want to say that the receptionist and the lady in charge of cosmetic treatments (Natasha), as well as my laser technician (I think Sharon), were all very, very nice. The doctor was a nice guy too. The office just seems to be really unorganized, no one knows what is going on, and the doctor doesn't really care to spend any time with you. I considered writing a review a couple times over the past year, but held off because I didn't want to make a big deal about it, but at this point I've just put so much wasted time into this, I thought a fair review would be appropriate. \n\nI did find another dermatologist who is amazing, and spent over 30 minutes in my initial meeting with me. Hopefully I can figure out this situation with New Leaf and move on, just not the right fit."
22541,2,"Looks like a lot of my fellow reviewers will disagree but I found Roka Akor to be all style no substance. Don't get me wrong the food was good, but I've definitely had better sushi at places that are much less expensive. Making cool designs on my plate with the sauce does not make it worth the extra money. I went because I had a Groupon. I would never go there at full price. Sitting at the bar and being able to watch the cooks was nice. They have an open kitchen right there in the dining room. And the cocktails we ordered were very good (and pretty strong!). \n\nI wouldn't necessarily discourage anyone from going to Roka Akor, but I personally think it's too pretentious and you could definitely find better sushi place in the Scottsdale area."
25122,3,"Went here last night for the second time.  Both times I really enjoyed my time there.  It's the kind of restaurant I am really happy to sit at and enjoy my meal and conversation for a while.  \n\nIt has a really nice ambiance, and pretty good food overall.  I've had lobster raviolis and steak there, and both were good.  \n\nI wouldn't say it's worth really going out of your way for, and it's kind of pricey compared to other restaurants in the area, but I'd recommend it if you want to have a nice meal."
39806,1,"The tacos are really good, 5 stars but I am only giving it two stars because of the way you have to order your tacos. Three separate lines for every meat.. I don't see how this makes things go smoother or faster.  We were in line for 45 mins and had to stick with one kind of meat because we were not going to be back in line again.  I'd like to go back next time I'm in Vegas but I'll have to go during the day with hopes that the lines are not as bad as wednesday night.  I wanted to try the Al pastor.. It looked real good..maybe next time."
10823,3,"This place is proof that some of the best food in Vegas is off the strip.\n\nI came here with 3 of my friends on a Saturday night at around 21:00 and the place was almost empty.  I was a little surprised but it worked out for us as we were hoping for a quiet dinner.  \n\nWe started with feta cheese with olives and the falafil appetizer.  The 1st was really good.  Good quality feta cheese and good quality olives.  A solid 4.  I think I could have just eaten the cheese and olives with the bread they bring.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot about the pita bread.  It comes out pipping hot like it was just baked-which it might have been.  Some of the better pita bread I've ever had.  Never had it this hot before.  Was absolutely a perfect compliment to the cheese.  The falafil was a little disappointing.  I felt the falafils were too dense.  I love falafils but feel a successful falafil is light with a lot of taste.  A 2 that I wouldn't order and am glad I didn't get the plate.\n\nOur three entrees were the Greek salad, the chicken kabob, the stuffed grape leaves and the tilapia.  The salad wasn't bad-pretty typical scoring a 3.  The tilapia was cooked perfectly but could have used more seasoning though with enough lemon squeezed on top came out pretty well, a 3.5.  The chicken kabob was excellent.  I think the best dish we ordered, a solid 4.  And my dish was the grape leaves which I adore.  They came with a lot of meat inside.  I wasn't expecting so much meat (ground beef I'm sure) and in fact this is was the most meat I've ever had served in my grape leaves.  They weren't bad but I think the vegetarian version of this dish would have tasted better.  A 3.5.  \n\nAnd I got the tamarind drink which was great.  Ordered a 2nd one.  The whole tab was about $120.  So I'll lean on the 4 star as the food was good enough that made me want to go back and try other things and foods."
36629,2,".... I reallllly want to like this place but there's just something standing in my way.... This place is not as meticulously maintained as other studio's however that is what gives this place character in my opinion and well the prices are also not as high as Karve and they have more variety in their classes lol. The location could be better, it's slightly off the 101 in an older shopping complex that does not lend itself to feeling safe when you're entering or exiting an evening class. Each time I've attended a session, I have always felt like the staff was friendly but fake.... For me that is really off putting. Also the general vibe is that of a dancers studio (which I like) with a bunch of cliquey old lady dancers (which I could do with out).  I really think this place would do much better if the environment was more welcoming especially to women who are not dancers per se but just want to branch out and try some thing new."
31844,0,The muffins are dry and over-baked. The selection is sparse. And the owners are RUDE. Enough said.
5568,1,"The only thing this place has going for it is the food.  Good variety of food to choose from.  If you are looking for a steak house, it is one of the best I have ever had.  I have been to numerous high end steak houses all over and this is one of the best.\n\nThe rooms here are disgusting.  I had two different rooms during my stay.  The first room; the towel holder broke off of the wall, the shower head was separated from the tile, the lamp was broken and the carpets were all stained.  The second room also had dirty carpets and there was actually dry blood running down the side of the bathtub.  Absolutely disgusting.  Don't these people clean the rooms?  If I can see it, I don't see how someone that is supposed to be \""cleaning\"" the rooms can miss it.\n\nI would definitely come back to eat, but I would never stay at this place again.  They have a lot of work to clean this place up."

However, they had some cool games but it would have been crazy to pay for a full day when we could only play for two hours. \n\nThe bathrooms were disgusting and the entire place smelled of raw sewage. I felt like I was in the French Quarter in New Orleans!"
49764,1,Customer  service  was horrible my wife waited for 10 min. For someone to take her order. Then I waited for a refill for 15 min while one of workers walked  around the kitchen not doing anything. She looked straight  at me and didn't ask if I needed anything. Food is OK not the greatest. If customer  service is better I would recommend  it.
4378,4,"My favorite place to eat in all of LAS VEGAS...! Hands down...\n\nReasons:\nCustomer service is superb.  I have been in Vegas for over two years now, visited this place at least over 2 dozen times but have nothing bad to say about it.  \n\nI love love the Korean Chicken Teriyaki rice bowl..its under four bucks, you get a good amount of rice and chicken.  The sauce is different then your normal Teriyaki sauce at other places. I've asked for extra sauce so many time, pretty much with every order...They give without charging an extra penny. \n\nI've recently tried their normal teri chicken rice bowl, also the same price but the sauce is less salty.  Feel in love all over again.  I don't know how this place stays in business charging as they do, but I think because its family own, quite affordable that the locals always comes back for more, keeping this awesome hole in the wall in business.  \n\nTheir spam masubi is 1.50, spam is decent in size and enough for a good filling snack.  :) \n\nI think what put it over the top for me was last night.  I order my usual, the chicken teri bowl on the phone,  but when i came to pick it up, their person who took my order thought i order the actually plate which was two times the price, I make it known to Matt, and he, without hesitation, gave me my food charging me for the rice bowl and extra side of chicken.  (I also tipped a few bucks for the nice service)  When i opened it, the size of my order was not the bowl but the plate.  I was amazed at the customer service this place continuous to reflect.  I called Matt to say thanks once again.  \n\n\nNo reason to not try this place if you haven't been in before, its worth the time, the drive and the room you have in your belly! :)"
33205,0,"I created my yelp account just to attest to this poor experience and to warn people.  BUYER BEWARE. Paid $300.00 for a deluxe cleaning package w/out engine steam. I was given an estimate of 2.5 hours, so I left my phone number for when they were finished. I return 3 hours later after no phone call. I waited for another 45 minutes while my car sat open and unattended with three other unsatisfied customers who's time estimates had lapsed by more than 45 minutes. I had to leave to reach an appointment with the car unfinished. Basically, left grossly late with an unfinished service, no refund, out $300.00. Will not return."
22898,2,I enjoyed the novelty of getting my mercury on for $3 in a big cup. The shrimp were of poor quality - of that I am sure - but love the concept and they tasted decent.
37307,1,"The food is good. Variety is sparse. Wish they had cottage cheese or apples or bananas as an alternative to potatoes. Not a lot of booths but so there is often a wait for seating. Tried it for lunch too as it is close to home tomato soup is very acidic and not very good, tastes like tomato paste.  Grilled Cheese was ok."
6490,1,"We missed lunch and stopped ther for just a bite around 2 pm. There was just a few costumers but we were standing at the counter waiting to order for over 10 minutes while a waitress was talking to someone eating at the counter and ignoring us the whole time. I glared at her until she got uncomfortable, said her shift was over and left the restaurant. \n\nThe girl she was talking to turned to be an employee, she finally got up, apologized and took our order.  We sat down and when our order came this other server didn't bring any settings, we actually had to call her back for it. She thought that was funny. I got the impression they only hire high school girls.\n\nThe spanakopita appetizer was actually quite tasty but the portion was way too small, 4 bite sized pies Hey spinach pie is not a luxury item! The grape leafs were run of the mill. No lamb gyro or kabab? Only beef and chicken, I have no use for a beef Gyro. The funny thing is that at the Charlotte cafe right next door they serve lamb Gyro and they don't even claim to be a Greek eatery. \n\nNot convinced"
19654,0,"We purchased a French bulldog puppy from here two days ago and today I took him in for his free vet check up. He has a respiratory infection and he has blood in his stool, both since we brought him home. The free vet is a very far drive for me and I'm worried they won't be honest regarding results of the fecal analysis so I will be taking him to my vet closer to home. The dr. at black mountain animal hospital stated that if I did so, my health warranty would be  void. \n\nOur puppy was very overpriced but I wanted to get him out of there. Our salesperson was nice but I did notice the other girls in the store were just trying to make sales. They also don't require any kind of adoption application which is scary. I thought that selling sick puppies was illegal in NV?"
18253,4,"awesome! one could loose hours here wondering through this amazing store. twists and turns find you in different rooms (LITERALLY! there is a 1930's house INSIDE UrbanSouthwest!) each room with a unique identity filled with unique treasures. the juxtaposition of old, vintage, and sleek modernity coincide beautifully within the many artisan made works of art. items vary from server hand crafted tables, to vintage ornate iron, to local art, and so so much more. highly recommend!!"
8745,1,"Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South."
10691,2,"food/service was ok. nothing special imo. i had a chicken sandwhich with hot sauce.\nid like to of had a beer with my lunch but they only had rootbeer.\nand the place did smell a little odd, kind of like a bathroom maybe it was the cleaning products?? it would be a lot nicer if they served beer and had the place smelling like the food theyre cooking.\nalthough this nellis location is closer, i liked the older location better."
28172,0,"Let me share with u fellow yelpers about the experience I received from this restaurant...I hope they don't delete this review just like my bad review of Red Chair Salon in SF that was deleted with no apparent reason. \n\nIt was around 9 pm that me n my friend was starving to death since we were too busy to walk around the strip to actually stop to have a nice meal. we figure that we could have a really nice dinner to make us full...so after several restaurants menu we read along the way...we stopped at Wazuzu n decide to try it out. we sat down and it took the waitress about 15 minutes to acknowledge us to take our order. the waitress came n it was this old chinese lady.....usually they don't really understand english very well but since its an upscale restaurant I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. so I asked her \""how many pieces of sushi do you get in the Crunchy Roll special menu?\"" she said \""Its a ROLL!! what do u think? its usually 6 pieces!\"" she was giving me an attitude!! even my friend across the table was shocked! so being the sassy girl that I am...I replied \""Well since its not written on the menu...how was anyone supposed to know that its 6 pieces?!?!?!? some places has 8 or 10 so its not my fault that I don't know these things...not to mention lady this is my first time at this restaurant!\"" I can't believe that the first question I asked her she gave me an attitude!! I mean hello???? it was $21 for that specific roll! of course I'm gonna ask u questions when its $21 per roll!!! \n\nThen I took a deep breath n asked her \""how big is the portion for the Minced Salmon with green onion?\"" and she respond \""Its in a bowl!!\"" \nI'm like ?????? how big is the bowl?!?!??! by this point I was just so mad n hungry so I just basically ordered my roll n spicy hot wings with rice n thai ice tea. before I finish telling u the whole story..let me break down the price of the things I ordered: \nCrunchy Roll $21\nSpicy hot wings $12\nWhite rice $5\nThai ice tea $5\n\nNow the Spicy hot wings turned out to be sweet...I have no idea where the spicy words come from. and the roll turned out to be covered in this little japanese fried balls that taste pretty weird with the shrimp tempura, cucumber, seaweed n rice (which is what a crunchy roll is) well I am paying $21 for this stinking roll..so I might as well eat it instead of wasting it. So I decided to take off this little tiny fried balls with my chopstick and just eat the plain sushi by itself. then that waitress stopped by n I kid u not this is what she said to me \""U are one spoiled girl huh????\"" I'm like \""EXCUSE ME?!?!?!\"" \"" YEAH..I CAN TELL THAT UR SPOILED BY THE WAY U PICK AT UR FOOD\"" ohhhhhh man!! I can't believe her!! I mean just because I don't like the little fried ball things n picking it out doesn't mean I'm spoiled!! n who is she to tell me that I'm SPOILED?!?!? I'M HER FREAKIN' CUSTOMER!!! WOWW!!! NEVER IN MY LIFE I RECEIVED SUCH BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!\n\nSo being the nice girl that I am...I dont like to make a scene instead I decided not to tip her cuz u know what?? the hell with it...I always tip at restaurants even when the customer service was bad. but this time hell no! she is not getting a dime from me n plus the overpriced bad food cannot make up the bad customer service! n really the thai ice tea was the only thing that was decent in that place. I mean c'mon they charge $8 for green tea!!!! Most places its free!!! Hello?!??!?!? if that's not overpriced I don't know what is...n rice for $5?!?!? white rice?!??! yeah u do the math and save ur money to go eat somewhere else."
37962,2,"Came here on Monday night.  Heard lots of good reviews.  Their hip hop room is very small.  Not a lot of good music was playing (compared to Vanity).  The pool area was packed, the main room was the best place to be.  A mixture of house, electronic, & hip hop.  Packed as well.  The library SUCKS!"
16184,3,"I just noticed this place when our Helldorado Days float went by it during the parade.  A few days later I checked it out.  It was pretty good.  I would say 3.5 stars.  The Beef Panang curry was very good, the chicken satay was good, but I didn't like the Larb.  I love Larb, but theirs was a little gritty-I assume from the spices in it.  I am happy to find another good place to eat for when I am Downtown.  This place isn't good enough as a destination Thai restaurant for me-I'd rather go to Thai BBQ or Lotus of Siam, but it is a happy downtown find.  i will go back again!"
16747,1,"I wish I continued reading more reviews instead of just the first 3 and looking at the pictures.\n\nFirst I'll say is the wait was wayy too long.  We came into this place for a breakfast before we went to our volunteering event, and the wait for our food really made us pushing it to get there on time, not to mention the fact that we had to send our food back because it wasn't thoroughly cooked,\n\nNow onto the meal... Certainly not work the money!  The eggs were raw (and sent back as previously stated), the sausage was disgusting, the mushrooms dried out quickly.  They got my friend's order wrong, but since they didn't enter it correctly on the receipt, they didn't offer to correct her order either.  When I sent back my eggs, the waitress said \""just so you know, this is a french-inspired restaurant and this is how they eat their eggs\"".  Good for the French, but we're in America, and I want my eggs cooked all the way through... and not even an apology.   \n\nAs far as the service goes, they were just slow.  The staff came across as unapologetic and stressed, which I don't know why because while I was sitting there, I only saw them bring out food for the couple that ordered before us.  The other 4 sets of people that were there before us either didn't order food (I'm assuming because no food ever came for them) or already had their food.  \n\nOverall, it was just a bad experience.  If I can say anything positive, the macarons were good.  My friend enjoyed her croissant, and the timing for our replacement eggs were much quicker.  \n\nIF and its a big IF I ever go here again, it will be strictly for the pastries."
6698,4,Love this place! Get corn quesadillas!
25696,2,The hotel is centrally located downtown Montreal . 5 minutes walk to subway .\nWe upgrade to junior suite . \nUnfortunately the room is dated . The bathroom is really old . \nThe staffs are friendly . We stayed Le Meridian in Barcelona . It was way nicer \n4 stars for location and staffs . 1 star for the room .
4598,2,"I've been to see a lot of urologists.\nA lot.\n\nI'm not a fan of male doctors, but it seems that most of the urologists or kidney specialists in this town are men.\n\nI attempted several times to set up an appointment or consultation using the web form on the website, and never received anything...not a call or an email.\n\nI called on Thursday, after noon, and was able to schedule an appointment for Monday. \n\nWhen I arrived, the staff was polite, and quiet.  \nThe paperwork was a bit much...I was literally filling in paperwork for a half an hour, but I understand that new doctors need to get information.\n\nThe nurse was nice, and made me feel comfortable while I was getting my bladder ultrasound done.\n\nDr. Kaplan was nice.  He seemed a little abrasive at first, but later it seemed he was more...appalled at the fact that previous doctors hadn't done much to help me.\n\nHe's the first urologist to offer me a preventative antibiotic, since I get frequent UTIs.  I'm not 100% sold on taking an antibiotic every day, just because of super bugs, etc, but at least he offered.  No other doctor has done that.\n\nHe's also the first to offer me a medication to help with the other bladder issues I've been having, that are starting to cause problems with my job.  \n\nHis office staff filled in paperwork for me, for help with work.  The woman I worked with was absolutely wonderful.  \n\nI like the office.  I'm not in love with them yet, but I'm always VERY cautious about feeling out doctors and their staff.  I have a follow up appointment next month, so we'll see how they do then, too."
3163,1,"Great course! However the locals (old people that could only afford to live on a golf course in BFE) think they run the place. The bartenders are pretty rude, as are the annoying messages they send your cart every hole (ex. Keep up with the group ahead... The same group you are caught up w and waiting on). They definitely over schedule the Tee times. I will say the course staff (rangers, food service) were great."
24324,1,"My wife and I stopped in this location today for an iced caramel macciato because we were in the area and we love these drinks.  The place was busy, but that is not a huge deal because Starbucks is a big name and has good drinks.  The service was prompt and friendly.  They were adequately staffed for a Sunday morning rush.  Our drinks came up with a standard wait.  However these drinks did not taste very good to either of us.  Mind you this is the only drink we get when we stop at Starbucks so we know it very well.  We tasted each other's and they did not taste right.  Mine was a quad shot and there was not a difference in the taste of either.  Usually mine tastes stronger.  The price was no different than any other Starbucks but the quality was less.  Maybe it was just a bad day for them.  I would try this location one more time and modify my review if the quality is any better."
10565,1,"I will not stay here again.  I am an owner in the Diamond Resorts chain and I have never been treated so badly at a Diamond affiliate.  On the good side, the housekeeping staff was terrific.  However, we made a mistake and forgot to put our parking pass on our dashboard one night.  The security guard pasted a sticker on our window that would not come off.  When I complained to management that they could use post it glue and not damage vehicles for a simple mistake, the manager did not care at all.  Yes, we made a mistake.  Does that give them the right to damage our vehicle?"
1023,0,"Pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust. Other menu items are good as well.  The service consistently sucks!  It's horrible!  Every time, service is absolutely horrendous. Proceed with caution."
27551,4,This place has the best vegetarian Pho I have ever tasted.  The spring rolls are also excellent.  The atmosphere is quite modern and fancy for being in a grocery store plaza.  For the price the place is amazing. It is the best restaurant I've been to in the area (definitely the superior than the other places I've visited in Mekong Plaza).
44899,1,"Food was good but I was quite surprised when my Gin Martini got delivered and the lemon twist floating in it still had the sticker from the grocery store/orchard...clearly the bartender that peeled the twist and rimmed the glass with it, as well as the server that brought it didn't think twice about the fact that there was blatantly a large sticker that said, \""Sunkist\"" floating in the drink as well"
26567,4,"I love D'Lisa!!!  She is great, personable, professional, efficient, and accomodating.  If ever a waxing job can be painless, she's doin it!  \n\nNew to the area and horrified of more bad experiences, I drove an hour to get to her and it was worth it!  Now I'm lucky I live right up the street!"
27455,4,"The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant"
35632,3,"Holy crap the miso ramen is really salty. The broth is still good though..you can really taste the miso. My sister had the tonkatsu ramen, which was much less salty, so I liked it more than the miso. Both soups were yummy. It's amazing how they get the broth to be so creamy without any butter!\n\nKimchi rice is meh, it wasn't as kimchi-y as I would have liked it to be.\n\nFYI: they have different noodles for each broth. The miso ramen has a thicker, chewier noodle (dericious) while the tonkatsu ramen has a thinner noodle that I didn't really care for. I didn't do this, but you could probably ask for the thicker noodle + the tonkatsu broth! \n\nTry to go early to avoid lines! We went around 6 PM, and by the time we left (630), there was a long line outside the door. Everyone seems to be in and out pretty fast, though."
47059,0,"Each time I go back, I like it less and less. Service is slow but I can deal with that. The (already understaffed bar) bartender is always too busy flirting with someone to notice we need something without having to flag them down but whatever, the beer is cheap enough. However, tonight marked a new low, one if which I probably won't return.\n New menu: small portions, same price and changed recipes (chicken strips, pretzel now in small bites). I ordered a burger but was told to substitute the fries with anything else is $4. Yes, $4!! My husband ordered the pretzel but asked of they would omit the mustard but give him an extra cheese instead. We were informed this would be a charge as well.  Even the bartender mentioned how asked annoyed the staff is with the menu changes. It's certainly not the servers fault but now this bar has nothing except cheap beer going for it. \nWe'll take the drive to Applebee's from now on."
44213,4,"My wife and I ate here for my 50th Birthday.\nWe enjoyed it very much! Z greeted us and explained the fusion concept, as well as the specials. We shared a delicious avocado shrimp salad followed by Curry fried rice (meatless) and I tried the yellow curry chicken \""extra spicy\""! My wife who has a very sensitive stomach loved everything! I also enjoyed every dish and would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family!"
44090,4,"Take out Pizza with out the grease! The pizza's from La Favourita are amazing - fact! MY favorita is the Capricciosa with extra anchovies followed by the Tiramisu. We had them last night after an afternoon of gardening which works up an appetite and a half I can tell you. Two large pizzas, between three and we were happy garden gnomes sat in the sun with a bottle of red. Lovely"
30639,0,"This was the WORST experience I have ever had at a las vegas pool.  The staff was RUDE, the lines were entirely too long, and the drinks were the cheapest of cheap you could get.  To top that off, the pools were over crowded, there was no place to sit or ly in the sun, and I was refused a towel. Never going back to this place again."
42036,2,"Man, I needed a quick fix after a night downtown and we literally stumbled upon this place.  \n\nI can't really say much as I was really drunk, however I do remember that the place is pretty small. There's a bar countertop and maybe a few chairs.   Little quaint place inside the casino.  The cashier who helped us was cordial and she even joked around a little with us which made it a great interaction.  \n\nFor the food, I got the mushroom swiss burger.  I can't remember the cost, however, I remember paying around 10 bucks for that and a shared appetizer of some sort.  What I do remember though, is that the burger was not flavored.  I thought it was super bland.  I the mushrooms were perfectly carmelized and the swiss did bring a little flavor, but the star of show (or supposed to be), the burger, wasn't really seasoned.  I really did enjoy the fries however.  They were super crispy and shoe string-ish.  My preferance!\n\nAll in all, it was an ok kind of place.  Not much to choose from that late at night but it did the trick!"
25398,4,"One of the best meals of my life (and I REALLY like to eat well:).  We stumbled into a tasting menu from a world renown chef.  It wasn't cheap ($150 for 7 course tasting menu and $80 for wine pairing each), but it was world class.\n\nWe didn't have a reservation, but we were there at 5:30 - so we were offered a spot at the bar, despite the restaurant being booked for the evening.\n\nOur bartender was friendly and fun, and made the experience a great one."
28957,0,"Terrible spring training facility. Bad food, seats all the sun, no cup holders. Many better stadiums around greater Phoenix area. Employees are rude and make the experience uninviting."
41452,3,"I have to say that I was a little shocked at the price of some of the clothes at the Nike store.  However I have to say that they are worth the price.  I bought a jacket that is used for running in the colder months made of  thermal material.  I really can wear a sports bra and this jacket and be warm enough during my workout.  I did have an issue with the first jacket, where the fabric was pulling apart at the seam.  I brought it back to the store and they didn't even question the exchange.  No hassle exchange!  That is why I will shop here again!"
5441,0,I used to love the veggie sandwiches here until I found out what I was supporting by eating here. Jimmy John is one of those people that use their money for evil. He pays a lot of the money that comes from this chain to go to Africa and shoot exotic animals. Beautiful elephants and cheetahs. Google it if you need to see for yourselves. Sandwiches are not that damn good. I'm disgusted. Boycott JJ.
7196,3,"I would have probably given this 3 stars if not for the awesome green chili stew and the variety of dessert frybreads that rock my world.\n\nThe various frybread tacos are solid, but nothing that exceptional. I like the chorizo one with lots of hot sauce. \n\nIt's a good neighborhood spot when you're in the mood for something a little different, or especially if you've got a sweet tooth! :)"
17151,4,Had incredible ribeye steak & a Mac n cheese dish.  Perfect!
42165,4,"I am shocked.  Only one review for ETHD.  A Phoenix institution. \n\nThousands of us do jury duty.  Ed's is a must stop on jury day.  Especially for the Chicago Dog.  He has all the napkins you need, plus places to sit."
25869,2,"I went here two times during my week in Montreal.  The first time I ordered the smoked meat sandwich and poutine.  The sandwich was rather bland, nothing to write home over, but the poutine parisienne was really good.  Another night I ordered the pasta alfredo....it was horrible!!!  It was bland, tasteless, for $16 came with no salad or piece of bread, it was like spaghetti with Elmer's Glue.  I wouldn't recommend that dish, there are other places you can go for much better pasta!\n\nThe service was so-so.  I ordered to go both times and the waitress was attentive enough, but as I sat there watched the wait staff play and text with their phones.  Hilarious.  This Dunn's is also located right next to a XXX massage parlor....just an FYI if you're thinking about brining the kids lol."
31884,4,"We came because of the $5 glasses of wine and oh were they good. Viogner blend is crisp & fresh, the cab franc was smoky.  The service was great our waitress was very candid & funny. The apple & prosciutto bruschetta are both amazing, you can mix & match."
47533,2,"Decent food, but as other reviews have stated, poor service. \n\nMy mom likes this place. She was born in raised in Phoenix and always comes here. I was along for the ride so I came in with an open mind. I ordered the vegetable beef stew special. It was pretty good, but I had never had fry bread before so I didn't have any expectations. \n\nMy biggest complaint would be that we asked for the desserts to go, and we had to go chase down the waitress and have her to bring them to us after we had finished eating our lunches. When they finally did come, they were made to eat at the restaurant so I had to ask the waitress again to have them packaged to go. I am guessing they made a fresh batch to go because it took a while. \n\nThe food was good but not to die for. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. And the interior of the place needs work. For a place that supposedly just moved into this location, it sure had a lot of broken tables and out of order bathrooms."
18786,0,"Is it just me, or does anyone else feel the need to sanitize themselves after leaving this dark, grimy store?"
23369,2,"Dined solo at this low-key sports-bar joint in the Palazzo.  The friendly bartender made up for the hostess' arrogance.  Fair wine selection, but limited menu options - especially if you are vegetarian.  The design is nice and it's fun to be able to watch the chefs preparing your food in what appears to be their very clean kitchen.  I had the burger and 3 bean salad with a nice glass of white wine, everything was tasty - but I wouldn't bother dining here again unless I happened to be hungry and standing outside."
13536,2,"We had bottle service at this club and our table was a lot smaller, the room we were put in was the house music room, we were stuck next to some older geezers, but they were nice, but we did have our own bodyguard, that looked like Big's older brother, from the show Rob & Big.\n\nThank god they changed the music half way thru the night! Well, I was too tipsy to mind, but it helped the ambiance and the mood. \n\nOther than that, getting in was a breeze, but if you don't know anyone to hook it up for you, it seriously looked like a \""cattle call\"" outside. The lines were a mess and you have no idea where to go.\n\nThe main dance room was playing some great music, from the 80's, 90's and that was an added touch. I would rather go to Tao or Tryst though."
34882,2,"OK so today someone in my office brought me a sandwich from City Market Deli. It was the Santa Fe Club. Oven Gold Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Alfalfa Sprouts, Chipotle Mayo served on Our Toasted Multi-Grain Bread.\n\nThe bread is very good and the sandwich has a good amount of flavorful turkey. The chipotle mayo has just the right amount of heat. Overall a very tasty sandwich!"
40566,4,Surprisingly good pizza!
10914,4,"I really liked this branch.  The personnel I dealt with, from the teller, banker, to the manager are all so nice, helpful, and best of all knowledgeable.  This is the nicest banking center I have encountered by far.  \n\nThe only thing I don't like is the busy location.  Traffic-wise...geez how I hate driving on Maryland PKWY.  Nonetheless, this banking center is big, many PBs on duty, excellent customer service (for me at least).  \n\nI will go back as it is convenient and of course, having knowledgeable PBs and management personnel is the best when it comes to one's finance."
47685,4,"The food is awesome, but the service here is great. I asked about options for my girlfriend since she cant have bread, and they not only prepared a lettuce wrap but offered to sanitize the counter since bread was prepared on it. It wasnt necessary, but it was great for him to offer!"
9459,2,"This is the only hotel I've stayed at downtown - I know, hard to believe a person from Hawaii never stayed at the California!!  But I'm really picky about what hotels I stay at and the California and every other hotel located downtown always made me feel itchy while walking through - like I said before: \""Happy Faye, happy stay!\""\n\nThe rooms were pretty average, but I only stayed in their standard rooms.\n\nI've had good experiences here and never felt unsafe (while in the hotel room and casino area).  All of the employees were always nice and helpful, which is always good to have!  Their 24 hour coffee shop serves good food at reasonable prices (they even have some \""Hawaii friendly\"" menu items!)."
30013,2,"My night spent in the Three Sisters took on two very distinct, and very different characteristics.\n\nLets start with the good part of the night. A fine summers evening had drawn us to the huge outdoor seating area of the Three Sisters, and as my friends bought the drinks and a Three Sisters BBQ blazed in the corner, I had an excellent time. The atmosphere was great and generally I had a very large amount of fun. \n\nHowever, then the second half happened - it was getting busier and attracted a hen party and a seperate stag party, which generally ruined the chilled, relaxed and fun vibe that we had before. The night was also growing colder so we moved indoors - well, I say moved, i mean we jammed ourselves inside bearly able to move in a hot mass of drunken people. I attempted to buy a drink next, and after waiting for nearly 10 mins, a round for 3 people came to almost \u00a325 - extorsionate.\n\nSo there you have it - get there early and you will have a great time, get there after everybody else does, and you might not want to come here again."
43456,4,"I'm typically not one to be super eager to write reviews. However, Amy deserves 5 stars! She was amazing from the second I stepped into the salon. \n\nBefore I go into my experience, here is a back story.... I would book appointments with my hair salon in California around my visits there. Now, that will not be necessary. As soon as I walked in, Amy was warm and welcoming. Once I sat down I told her exactly what I wanted and she nailed it! My color and cut was perfect. The scalp and hand massage was amazing and super relaxing. From start to finish she was very attentive and understood what I wanted. I have found my new stylist in Scottsdale! Thank you Amy, you were fabulous!!!"
30675,4,"This place is great!  Every time I'm in town, I go here for a few beers and a good time.  It's basically the Cheers of Pittsburgh...\n\nThis place used to be a really run-down, shady bar that was well-known for the rough characters that would frequent it.  It was shut down by the city (or maybe the previous owners left, who knows) and a new family - The Hough's - opened it back up after major renovations and improvements.\n\nI cannot say enough about the family who runs the place (Barb is amazing, so nice and a great smile!) and the bartenders (Kevin is the man!)  The beer selection is incredible...microbrews, Belgian ales, imports, seasonals, PA craft beers.  Likewise, the specials run every day but Sunday and are great.  They just recently changed their food menu so make sure to take a look at that.  The most I have ever ordered was the grilled cheese sandwich (AMAZING!) which comes with fries, but I have seen more complex dishes that looked rather good for a bar.  Better yet, the prices for food and drinks are all very reasonable, the bathrooms are clean and the place is very comfortable - no more hot, humid bars for me (one of the things I hate the most)!\n\nIf you're looking for a friendly, inexpensive and comfortable place to grab a few beers or maybe a bite to eat - this is definitely the place to go!  They even have a board where they post pictures of all the regulars - I mean, how much better can you get?\n\nPS - If you want to play darts, its super cheap, check them out too!"
20176,4,"Anybody who goes downtown must eat here.  We actually stay at the Golden Nugget in part because of this restaurant.  I was blown away to discover this is part of a chain. I find the food to be almost perfect everytime I come here.\n\nThe service and the setting are very good if not perfect. The food though is what steals the show at this restaurant. Every dish that you try explodes with flavor and freshness. I have been eating here for over 10 years and it is consistently 5 stars every time.\n\nThe grotto is not a good restaurant for downtown; it is easily one of the very best restaurants in all of Las Vegas.  They blow away most restaurants that are more than double the price. Get your Italian on and eat at this restaurant, you won't be disappointed."
13202,3,"Great place to stay. Rooms are spacious and clean. The price is fair. It's at the end of the strip so there's less foot traffic which is a blessing. The air is cleaner vs other hotels. Lots of things to do in the hotel: beach, mall, bars, clubs, spa, many others."
16545,0,"The great reviews are not a TRUE reflection of this place. \n\nThis is NOT an authentic Greek resturant. Be  aware!!! My biggest complaint about this place...the food is not cooked fresh :-( \n\nI ordered a chicken greek salad, which tasted pretty good, but the meat was processed. I politely asked the male owner about the chicken, who responded by saying the chicken was fresh, they season it, grill it and then \""heat\"" it up in the oven as it's ordered. If the meat is heated up, is it \""heated up\"" in a microwave??? \n\nThe pita bread that comes with the salad was cold and hard. I couldn't even eat it. I asked the owner if the bread was always that hard. He responded with an attitude and told me the bread is NOT cooked fresh at the store. They put herbs and oil in it and heat it up. He continued to respond with an attitude and asked me if I wanted my money back. \n\nWhen I decide to dine out (especially at a Greek resturant), I expect for my food to be cooked fresh, without it being processed!"
13488,1,"Expected to get  fed for $50-60 (fresh fish in Vegas) and left more money at the restaurant than at the craps table!\n\nFood was good, fresh, nicely prep'd. Portions were smaller than average. Price was over 2 times what I pay in down town DC which is pricy already. Oddly enough, drinks were reasonable. My manhattan martini was generious and $10. (same in DC).\n\nSitting at sushi bar was pleasant with an impressive huge animated  display behind the sushi chefs.  Service was good, friendly and prompt. Recommendations from the waiter were tasty.  \n\nWent to a different casino to recover the losses at the MGM ;-)"
2280,2,"Yelp reviews sent me to this Company. They were a second opinion for repair over a personal recommendation. I was blown away by the professionalism of the technician and Dave ( install coordinator?). I would have given the company 4.5 stars but the original phone call to receptionist / assistant/ call operator was off putting. Kind of an air of arrogance. Made it past that to the actual nuts and bolts of the operations and was very satisfied even though the news was a unit replacement at $4k. Within 24 hours a crane was onsite and replacement complete. Then I received a phone call from Lisa for payment. Same attitude, coldness, indifference to my business. It's tough to see the people actually doing the work in the field professionally, honestly, and promptly get tainted by the phone answerer / bill collector. Fix that problem and this company is amazing. Overall still happy I chose them for my repair."
7756,3,We have been taking our daughter to Dr Gentile since birth. She is now 10 months. We have had a positive experience every time with Dr. Gentile. We only had 1 negative experience  at the Gilbert office with a different doctor at that location. She told me I needed to give my very large baby (9lbs) formula when I was solely breastfeeding. I didn't like that at all especially since I told her that I didn't want to do formula. I decided not to take her advice and see Dr. Gentile instead on our next visit. Dr. Gentile always respects our wishes. \n\nWe are very happy.
24441,2,"Hmmm if I ever go back to Pittsburgh maybe I will be able to check out the Strip when there's actually people around - it was pretty empty when we were there, unfortunately.  There were at least a few coffee shops around and one over-priced chocolate shop, not much else though that I saw in the way of anything interesting.  Maybe we were on the wrong street or maybe just bad timing."
20725,0,"I have to say, this was some of the worst service I've ever had at a local restaurant:\n\n-Our waitress got my drink order wrong twice, never brought my companion's drink, brought the wrong kids meal, and was surly each time she approached our table - which wasn't often. \n\n-The restaurant was practically empty, yet it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive. \n\n-Neither the waitress nor any other staff member ever stopped by to let us know what was going on or apologize for the delay, though we had hungry toddlers waiting. \n\n-When we arrived, they told us they don't seat people downstairs in the daytime, yet a group came in half an hour later and was seated downstairs - and received their food before we did!\n\n-They tried to argue with me when (after 40 minutes) I told them to cancel my daughter's order, box whatever food was ready, and bring the check. \n\n-When I arrived home with my food, I found that the $7 appetizer I bought consisted of three tiny pieces and a clump of greens - for twice the cost of a slice of their mediocre, dry pizza.\n\nFor being billed as a \""family\"" pizza place, they were anything but family-friendly. The food is of poor to middling quality at a premiere price tag. I will never visit this restaurant again, and would not recommend it to anyone I know. \n\nIf you need a replacement venue, Cafe Porta Alba offers a far superior pizza experience for both foodies and their families."
10787,0,It amazes me how HD stays in business.  Employes look dumbfounded when you need to know where an item is. Yesterday I asked a assoc. where an item was located. I had to repeat myself 4 times because he couldn't remember the name of the item I was looking for.  Without fail when shopping there isn't a time that at least one item I'm looking for is always out of stock.
29153,1,"Only reason why this is even a 2 is because I have eaten here before and the food is great. \n\nI have never had service like this before here... \nStarted off normally. Greeted at the door, seated... The restaurant was a little busy at a little before 10. We got drinks within a couple minutes of being seated... French press was delicious... and then the waiting... 5 minutes... 10 minutes... 15... I'm about done watching others get seated and orders taken... I watch the waitress put in orders... talk to the other staff... not even a look over to out table... Got up and left... Not what I expect from Postinos... I won't be returning to the central location again..."
3884,4,"Best gym ever. They have so much here its crazy. If you want a gym that more than just a \""gym\"" come here. I have been with my personal trainer Max for a year and love it. \n\nI would highly recommend to anyone."
45442,1,"I only come here when I feel like splurging because they're very pricey. The owner is very nice, but I don't like how sometimes I feel like my bowl is not full. :(\nTheir acai bowls are really good. It has everything you want in a snack or a dessert: crunchy, sweet, sour, and refreshing. I just wish it didn't take super long to get your food."
40661,1,"Just OK.  If you've never seen Elton John in the 80's, 90's, or 00's, then this is a great show for you.  However, for those of us that have seen him many times in prior years, this show is a dud.  First off, his voice is gone.  He struggles to get the tonal quality of all of his classics, and he loses so much from the effects and beauty of those greatest hits off 'Madman Across the Water\"" and \""Tumbleweed Connection\"".  Case in point, listening to him struggle with \""Your Song\"" made me want to cry.  On the positive side, I have never ever seen his piano playing hotter or more 'spot on' than I did last night. This was the greatest part of the show.  \n\nIn summary:  A true classic artist that's worth seeing if you haven't before.  Others like me just might end up cringing their way through it."
32353,3,"Decent place, cool atmosphere"
3680,1,"Went to a day game on 3/27/10 against the SF Giants  Plenty of fans of both teams were in attendance.  I'd have to say this stadium was more like an old minor league ballpark - sparse, not a lot of fluff, needing some renovation, but sufficient to host baseball games for plenty of fans.  The grandeur of the signage on outside of the stadium belies the inside condition.\n\nParking was fairly easy, and only $5. Despite signs disallowing tailgating, there was plenty of that, including lots of people throwing balls in the parking lot where cars were moving around.  Parking lot staff did nothing to stop them.  On the other end of the lot we were in were the practice fields, and when we arrived the Angels were just finishing their batting practice so there was a huge crowd of people standing around at the far end of our lot..\n\nGoing in, we stood in one line and got all the way up to the ticket lady before finding out that they had a _separate_ line for tickets purchased on line, so had to move to the other side of all the intake lines, and  stand in line again to enter.  The lack of signage for that was annoying.  I must also say that the lady who checked my purse for contraband did the most thorough job of any purse-checking person I've ever seen.  She was in everything!\n\nWe had cheap bleacher seats just beyond first base for this game.  They were fine, but they were also in the sun for the whole game.  Didn't care for the fellow next to me constantly and loudly talking to his friends in our row and the row behind, but that's not the stadium's fault.  One funny thing was that it appeared that the players had to actually pass through the public portion of the stadium to get from the practice field to the game field, including coming across the concourse where the concession stands were, among the fans, and down the steps where the seats were in left field.  It presented a good opportunity for fans to ask for autographs, for sure, but somehow it struck me as weird.  That would never happen in a major league park.\n\nWe walked around the whoie stadium to see what they had, and were strangely unimpressed.  Food selection was fairly standard for stadiums, nothing special there.  My BF liked their beer selections.\n\nLeaving the game afterwards was really bad as traffic was only superficially directed by stadium staff and Tempe PD, both of whom seemed surprisingly confused on what needed to happen.  It took more than a half hour to drive the two blocks away from the stadium exit.  You'd think that after having four week of games there (and doing it for four years), they'd have figured it out better, esp. since they knew ahead of time that the game was sold out..\n\nI think we can put Tempe Diablo Stadium in the \""been there, done that\"" category now.  We had a good time, but probably won't move any mountains to go again for a few years."
44290,3,"Just got back from first time lunch at Mediterranean Grill.  It was very good!  They were short handed due to unexpected departure of an employee and went out of their way to make sure the customers left happy.  Food was fresh and delicious, love that grilled pita.  Will be going back again soon!"
24533,4,"Amazing food. Awesome owner. Just great everything. Love this place, and definitely plan on going back! :)"
26409,0,"I order from Donato's at least once a week, and unfortunately this location screws up my order more often than not.  When I call to complain its hit or miss whether I get a manager who will take the appropriate action and give good customer service. Tonight when I ordered a salad for my daughter with no nuts or cheese, I of course got one with. All I heard from the manager was a \""sorry, next time maybe order by phone instead of the Internet\"".  Obviously, from the other reviews this place still hasn't gotten it together in the 4 years that it's been open! @donatos"
49130,1,"I'm guessing the number of great reviews on this place is due to the fact that most people on The Strip in Vegas are drunk and have the munchies.  While the menu looks great, the food is underwhelming.  We had the Chili Fries for an appetizer - it was OK, but nothing special.  Then we had the Mayor of Flavortown.  The sandwich was kind of dry.  The seasoning on the fries was strange - almost sweet - not what I want in a French fry.  The staff was great and I liked the atmosphere, but we won't give it another try."
28636,0,"oh well we had waited several months before trying this place. \n\nAn early dinner yesterday at about 4:30 pm. \n\nNot busy so we were seated straight away. A booth, yuck I hate booths. This one was hot for some reason so we moved to a table with two chairs, I guess a half booth. It was much cooler. \n\nI guy I forget his name was the server and he said at least three times I am going to take care of you real good and or well. \n\nWell the first thing we order is our drink, me water Gus iced tea. Well the guy waiter took only a few moments to get this to us, but of course placed the drinks opposite to who ordered. \n\nOne appetizer, that being calamari. \n\nMY meal was the Tour of Italy Being Homemade lasagna, lightly breaded chicken parmigiana and creamy fettuccine alfredo. \n\nGus ordered Pork Milanese \n\nPan-seared pork scaloppini crusted with Italian herb breadcrumbs, served with asiago cheese-filled tortelloni pasta tossed in a garlic-butter sauce with fresh spinach. \n\nWe had the salad too. \n\nSo we get the salad, but the waiter wants to give a one soup and one salad. The salad was not really great. \n\nAppetizer is set down and about three minutes later the entrees. First off learn to pace the meal dude and try to remember who ordered what. Not once did he get it right even though he claimed it would be good service. \n\nI won't go in to each meal other than to say it sucked. Oh well another 53 bucks down the drain."
19396,2,"We went to Western Trails Ranch today with the inlaws. All in all, it wasn't too bad. The restaurant is out in the middle of nowhere at what is basically a little tourist trap just outside of Wittman. My inlaws had a coupon so they invited us for a cowboy type lunch. Yes they live in Sun City...so coupons are a way of life there.\n\nThe restaurant is very rustic in decor but has big screen tvs all over the place so people can watch the games. There are rows and rows of picnic tables outside and about 20 tables inside. We chose inside because it was chilly outside.  \n\nThe menu is beef, beef and more beef with a smidge of chicken and pork. We had some fantastic onion rings. The salads were refreshing but basic. The grownups all had steaks which were slow cooked and tasty. Not the best steak I ever had but pleasantly better than I had expected. My son had a 100% angus burger that was a 12 oz burger. It was enormous and DELICIOUS. The grill was filled with great mesquite wood and it gave all the meats a nice flavor but it really enhanced the burger. \n\nThe side dishes were nicely done as well. Two of us had beans which had different types of beans and bacon in it. There was also baked macaroni and cheese which was pretty good. The coleslaw was delicious--with horseradish in it. Yum! The french fries that went with the burger were well seasoned and crispy.\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like was the fact that they kept the doors open to the restaurant. It was a chilly day today and I don't like having flies buzzing around my food unless I'm in my own backyard. I'm sure the outdoor seating will be lovely in the spring though when its warmer and sunny. \n\nThe service was prompt, courteous and pleasant. The cook came in to check on us about our steaks and he was quite nice as well. While I don't think I would go out of my way to drive this far for a steak, I might consider bringing out of town guests here for its rustic authenticity and the food really was pretty darn good. But after giving Posh 5 stars, 3 seems adequate for this out of the way place."
34692,3,"Efficient staff with even measured decorum. I had two eggs with creton and baked beans. Odd, their creton is served in a market-wrapped portion. Probably accessible in grocery stores soon. All elements of the meal we're fine. My wife had the egg benedict. The hollandaise sauce was rather sweet but still pleasant. Really folks, a good breakfast place but without the charm of a 'mom & pop' intangibles."
31680,1,"HAZE needs to rid their lousy promotions group - the Light Group. They are a bunch of frauds and without them; it would probably bump up their rating by another two stars. \n\nThe VIP areas are lame. It looks and feels like an area for herded cats. \n\nThe music, however, was cool."
146,1,"If you like filthy buses, super high fares and about 50% rude operators then you will love Port Authority service.  Now if you like clean buses, reasonable fares and friendly service you will need to go somewhere else.  And no place for children as the language on the buses would make a sailor blush.  And in 14 years of riding Port Authority I have never seen a uniformed Port Authority officer riding a bus."
38165,3,"I read a review on Yelp about how good their French Dip sandwich is and really wanted to try it, but it was the weekend and their brunch menu is served until 5pm. Oh well, the build your own burger made up for it. The shoestring fries are delicious! The service was a bit but slow although we waited less than 10 minutes for a party of 5 and this was after waiting over 30 minutes at Holstein's upstairs. Definitely glad we came here instead. Left full and satisfied. If you're hungry, order the spinach artichoke dip for a starter. You won't regret it."
9636,2,Went last night for a late dinner around 10pm. The service and ambiance were great. I loved the entertainment. The food was pretty good except for my lamb. I ordered it medium rare and it came out well done. It was the worst lamb I ever had.
25884,2,"Ah. This place kills me......for two reasons. Firstly, it USED to be amazing...Then all of a sudden, the quality of the food and service kind of crashed. And secondly, what kind of restaurant DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR FOOD TO GO?!??! This is the reason I won't be back. I had gone there with a friend, and we ordered and appetizer to share and then a main dish each. I had the veal with mushroom sauce which in the past was pretty amazing. However, halfway through that dish, I got full (shocking, I know). At the end of our meal, both of us asked for the rest of our dishes to be packed to go and we were told by a very unhappy woman that this would not be possible. Either eat it all here, or too bad. It was SHOCKING. So.....although the food is ok, I won't be returning here. I don't like feeling ripped off, and the fact that they won't give you the rest of your paid-for food, makes me feel totally ripped off.  :|"
33477,1,"I stayed at the cosmopolitan for our 5 year anniversary.  We booked their suite with wrap-around balcony and the view of the fountains.. paid around 900 bucks for 2 nights.\n\nThe good:\n- Best views in vegas - we had a view of the bellagio fountains and the strip\n- Big room - 1200 sqft of room.. thats massive\n- Convenient location, central to everything\n- Most of the staff was courteous and polite\n\nThe bad:\n- no drinking water ( most hotels at least have a bottle - specially needed after a long flight and super-hot vegas weather )\n- no coffee machine\n- no toiletries beyond the basics - we asked for a shaving kit which took 1 hour to arrive. There was no bath scrub, etc. which most hotels in this price range offer. \n- gym access was 20 bucks per day - I actually had made sure that the hotel had gym, I guess they forget to mention that you have to pay to use it\n- renting a chair at the pool was a few hundred bucks\n- chocolate cake took 1 hour to arrive and wasn't that good\n- we ate at the Chinese+mexican restaurant which was basically overpriced and lousy food.\n- the bathroom light wasn't working, so i called the concierge. nothing happened for 2 hours, and I had to call again. they said the previous person didn't put the request in.\n\nI have stayed in a lot of vegas hotels, both for work and pleasure from 60 per night to the mgm sky lofts - but this hotel has underwhelmed me the most.  I have come to expect a certain level of service from high end hotel, and the cosmopolitan completely disappoints."
14206,1,Went here for lunch and it was baaad. The cornbread was edible and that was about it.
42517,2,"I enjoy Winghart's, but they could definitely be better.\n\nThe burgers are good and of good quality meat.  I've never had a disappointing burger.  They aren't the best burgers in the city, but are very good.\n\nThe beer selection and pricing is good.  The whiskey selection is amazing.\n\nTheir fries are horrible.  They are over cooked and over salted.\n\nOverall, I'd say Fat Head's or Smiling Moose are better for burgers.  Winghart's is my choice when people want the burgers, beer, and whiskey trifecta."
6300,2,"Both my brother and I went there for our first time after hearing all the hype. We both had the single block burger. I wanted to try the big block but not going to pay $8.00 for a double cheese burger and no side included. So we both ordered the single block ($4.75) with cheese which is extra 50 cents. So total $5.25 for a single cheese burger in my mind thats a pretty expensive burger to not come with anything at all. And an order of fries to split. It took about 15 min for the burgers to come out and the place was not busy at all. Once we finally got the burgers, they were pretty good but I will say it was not worth the money to me. Fries were soggy. I also noticed online there menu prices are lower then what they are in the restaurant so I guess they up'ed there prices recently. \n\nOverall I will say the burger was good, had good flavor, and came out correct. I just feel that the food is a little over priced for being a \""diner\""."
6564,1,"As lovers of sketchy Jamaican and Caribbean restaurants, my boyfriend and I (newcomers to Madison) decided to try Jamerica for dinner. We had sampled their jerk chicken at Taste of Madison this summer but wanted to get the full experience, not to mention that I had a mad craving for some coconut rice and stewed cabbage. It was cold outside, so we decided to grab a case of Capital's Winter Skal and get our jerk chicken to go. Entrees on the dinner menu range from 11.50-15.50 each, which is pushing it for me, but they are cooked to order which is much appreciated. Jerk chicken will set you back 11.50, and if you want some delicious plantains they'll charge another $3. The chicken was dark meat, skin on, bone in and we got 4 thighs with our one meal. The jerk sauce was not very spicy or flavorful, and the chicken was quite greasy. The rest of the styrofoam takeout container was filled with a mixture of stewed cabbage, carrots, and broccoli on one side and rice and red beans on the other. Not much flavor there either :( In my opinion the best part were the plantains, but as I said earlier it was $3 for about 6 or 7 pieces. \nThe inside is very inviting on a cold night and the decor is eclectic. Next time I'll go for lunch and stay a while. In the meantime, I'll try David's."
41720,0,"Place was cool the first time we went, but we decided to go out of our way again but what was waiting for us, changed it all... 2 hostesses we're sitting, talking and when i asked about the vegan menu, i got sarcastic looks and an even stupider answer. So therefore, i will never return unless i'm starving and happen to be in the Mandalay Bay. Just cuz someone is vegan doesn't mean you should treat them different."
22330,4,This place closed down. Now it is a Thai Basil.
40515,4,Justus is THE MAN when it comes to hair. He's a genius at color too. There's definitely a reason why I followed him from the good old Palms Place days when we worked together. Stop by and let him work his magic on you!!!
405,3,"In Charlotte for business and wanted some good local fair.  Fired up the Yelp and see Alexander Michael's getting awesome scores.  The map says 1.5 miles away and I don't have a car - going to have to hoof it.\n\nShow up about 7:30pm on a Wed.  Place wasn't crowded at all and I got sat right away.  The staff was nice.  I ordered the Fried Pickles as an appetizer.  Some people say they are too salty and I say, \""Well, they're pickles.\""  They get paired up with a cup of ranch, but I think they would have been better with Blue Cheese.  Hint: use just a little ranch on your fried pickle.\n\nNext up was a bowl of Spicy Crab Soup.  This is pretty much an enchilada soup with crab meat in it.  Not that that's a bad thing.  It's good soup.  But spicy?  No.  No it is not.\n\nMain course is the Blackened Catfish Sandwich.  This right here is what I'm talking about.  The filet is a monster.  A tasty, flakey monster.  They pair it up with a tarter sauce (did I detect a pepper in there?  Chipotle maybe?) and some kind of other sauce that was like a chunky salsa/sweet-n-sour thing.  Doesn't matter.  I dumped both of them on.  It was tasty as all get out.  I devoured the enormous sandwich. The side dish I chose was the Broccoli Slaw and honestly, it tasted like 'healthy'.  Skip it.  Do the cajun fries instead."
7966,3,"Yum City! I went here with a group of friends after having a few drinks and it was delicious. My fiance and I split the \""Baseball winner\"" which had strawberry ice cream, mint chocolate chip ice cream topped with hot fudge and melted marshmallow sauce. I thought for sure I would get the diabetes. Even though they have Family Circus cartoons, I recommend this place  for people with and without kids. If you are in old town and are looking for a sweet treat this is your place."
40148,1,"It's a good concept, but poorly executed. I have been to Vapiano about 4 times and each time it gets worse. If you have haven't been before, when you walk in, it looks appealing and smells good. They hand you a blank credit card and you walk up to the food stations to order. Pizza station first, then the pasta stations. Then you take a seat and wait to pick up your food. When I went with my friend, she had never been before, she was utterly confused by the place, several people cut in front of her at the food stations, and she had to wait forever for her meal. When she got it, she said it was mediocre at best and she was never coming back with me. I have been during the work week lunch time crowd (go at 11:30am or the lines become unmanageable) and for the 5pm dinner. They do have a small outdoor seating area but don't bother as all you are doing is watching office workers go home!\n\nAs for my meal, I got the pizza- it was an undercooked bland mess. Then I got the pasta, there is a difference between al dente and hard. This restaurant needs to spend the extra 3 minutes and make sure the food is cooked thoroughly. \n\nTo Vapiano: either do table service or set it up cafeteria style, this in-between business is not working."
13724,3,"I was told this was the best buffet in Vegas and I don't see how anywhere else can compete.  They had everything from snow crab, king crab, steak, prime rib, shrimp, and all of the other typical buffet foods.  More on the expensive side, but you have to go here if you go to Vegas.  All the crab I ate, must have been worth so much at a normal restaurant.  \n\nWhat can I say, when John Wall is chillin right outside, it must be good.  Everything was tasty and very flavorful.  Definitely going back next time I'm in Vegas."
34398,1,"I went here for happy hour at 5:30pm on a Thursday and it wasn't too crowded. We sat outside which was a mistake because it was SO loud with all the bikes across the street. The drinks were just ok, and the brie appetizer was kind of a joke. Only served with 3 small pieces of bread? Most people order appetizers for at least 2. We asked for more and they brought it out free of charge. The service however was great so that kind of made up for the mediocre drinks and appetizer."
41104,4,"All I can say is Wow! I hosted a party here last Saturday for 40 guests as a surprise party for my parents anniversary. I had worked with Nate and everything we talked about he delivered, from the size of our reserved space on the back patio to the food etc. Our server, Ashley, was as good as it gets, everyone always had a drink, we never had to go looking for her. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun, casual place to have a private party as all our guests raved about the food, service etc!."
35657,3,"Great food, attentive staff, fast service. Expect a long wait Friday and Saturday nights to be seated.....especially if its a rainy day perfect for noodles."
34262,1,This place is way overrated. We came here for brunch.  We ordered the Duck buns and brown butter lobster rolls and a side of fries. Started out with two pints of Maudite (heck its Vegas!) The service took its time and we had to wait for our food. The duck buns were good and the meat was nicely shredded with a nice dollop of Hoison Sauce. As for the main course the lobster rolls were a disappointment. The meat tasted like it had been sitting for a while and though drenched in brown butter it was missing taste and the portions were small. We split the second pint. The beer selection is good but the prices are high. So for 2 people without a significant amount of food or drinks we ended up paying over 1$$ which is ridiculous for a pub. I guess I am one of the few people who doesn't like gastro pub craze that's sweeping the nation. If the food is done right and a portions are fulfilling I would have no complaints but just jacking up the price while serving mediocre fusion food is unacceptable.
34630,1,"Went here August 1, 2014 for dinner. Should have save my $26, it was not worth it. Smelled fishy when you walked in. Save your money. Even prime rib was tough. Service was good, not there fault food is bad."
43727,0,"Save your $ and time, go somewhere else!\n\n1st there are a TON of \""snow birds\"" that eat here. I mean the entire place is covered with white haired individuals and you will overhear their loud conversations about the \""multiple surgeries\"" and \""horrible symptoms\"" of this and that... It's obnoxious. In fact, when we walked in two elderly couples blatantly cut in front of us. The lady at the register saw it, and did nothing. Evidently, unless your old you are second rate here.\n\n2nd on a Friday night at 6pm they were out of salmon? What? So we both got the alfredo. Bad choice. Even our waitress commented \""I think it's disgusting here\""... why is it on the menu then for $13.99?! It tasted like a smart ones microwavable dinner. Gross and watery with ZERO flavor.  \n\n3rd their salad bar was OK - no tomato soup, onion rings, sprinkles or cheese toast (staple items at the Sizzler I once worked at).\n\nOverall, we paid over $30 for bad service and terrible food. We won't be back and I don't recommend it!"
30418,0,"The patio was nice,  but don't expect to get good service when you sit there. Took over 15 mins before we got our drinks even ordered.  Everyone finished our drinks before our lunch order was take.  An hour later the food finally came out. It wasn't really hot and looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The server said they had a large party come in. So she was spending her time with them and forgot out the people outside. There was 4 tables outside and we all complained.  The food was not worth the wait"
47511,1,We stopped in Friday for their new fish fry.   We both had the perch.   We both felt it was at best unremarkable.   The lake perch were small and overdone so there was no flakiness to them.   The fries were good.  The small slaw side was tasteless.   The Belgian IPA I tried was the best Next Door beer I've had here in a number of visits.   I'd rate it 5/10 on a scale of Belgian IPA's I've tried.   Overall an unexciting visit.   I would not earmark the place for any sort of visit.   I hope they succeed but they really need to get in touch with what people expect!    Madison has a great array of beckoning places...Next Door doesn't inspire return visits.
36800,3,"I ordered the bacon wrapped cheddar hot dog & it was delicious with tater tots as a side. ( yes i'm a G like that) Our waiter was cool although he seemed too busy flirting with the table netxt to us. The food was good and it was inexpensive ( for vegas standards) . The mechanical bull shook my boobies , that was fun"
33985,0,My past two haircuts with this location were horrible. First awful experience the lady left a long patch on the back of my head. Today I don't think she shaved the right side of the neck line. Two in a row so I will not go back a third time. Trying place across the street.
43195,4,Breakfast was fantastic today!  We had the French toast and biscuits and gravy along with home fries and sausage. The sausage was filled with flavor. It's been years since we have been here and the new owners have done a great job of keeping the same casual atmosphere while adding a better menu. Great job!
25023,1,"Ok for a quick lunch. The server was nice, but the food was average at best."
19208,3,"You've got to hope that a restaurant named after a saint isn't some sort of trashy place, and I'm happy to report St. Francis in central Phoenix was ultra-classy and had wholesome, delicious food that would probably make the patron saint of animals proud.\n\nThe beautiful two-story spot, with fresh flowers and candles on every table, as a very cozy vibe. Tables are close together inside, and there's a spacious patio and bar area. When I went, footage of Julia Child was being projected on a wall near the bar, adding a quirky and fun element to the otherwise posh restaurant.\n\nOur server was extremely knowledgeable about the comfort food menu, offering up vegetarian options, giving his recommendations and explaining ingredients and cooking techniques in dishes.\n\nWe started out with Baked Goat Cheese ($9), which was a bowl of the cheese accompanied by crackers. The cheese and tomatoes were so good, but I preferred to dip the soft bread we got with our meal into it rather than the crispy baguette.\n\nFor my entree, I had a Vegetarian Flatbread pizza ($13), which had such soft dough. It was perfectly cooked-lots of cheese and veggies, including broccoli and tomatoes, and the crust was amazing.\n\nFor dessert, I had a to-die-for Roasted Blackberry and Mascarpone Cheese dish ($7). The cheese was so flavorful, and the fresh fruit made it a great summer dessert. St. Francis uses locally grown ingredients, and not only did the food taste great, it felt nice to be supporting sustainability.\n\nI also had a Pineapple Rum Mojito ($9), which seemed heavy on the soda but was refreshing.\n\nThe whole vibe at St. Francis was peaceful and positive. Their menu changes with what's in season, and I can't wait to go back and try more of what the place has to offer."
35960,3,"I do love my cameras.  Taking a good photograph is something that I get a great deal of joy from.  Jessops is a great shop for all things camera, and it was their store on Shandwick Place that I visited today.  I mainly went in to have a look at their tripod range, as this is something that I've been thinking of purchasing.\n\nEntering the shop was an oddly relaxing experience.  Unlike some stores, the walls and shelves were not crammed floor to ceiling.  Instead, the displays were laid out in an uncluttered manner that doesn't bombard your brain with a lot of information.  \n\nThe store is quite large, and covers all aspects of photography.  You can get all sorts of cameras from small point-and-shoot right up to high-end digital SLRs.  They also stock binoculars and telescopes, along with accessories for all of these things.  I had a good look at their range of tripods, which covered a large price and size range.\n\nJessops is a must for either browsing or buying photographic equipment.  They also do printing and processing, and clearly know their stuff, having been around as a company for 75 years now."
8031,4,Everything is awesome.  Guac.  Their unique version of carne guisada tacos.  Carne con Queso was unique.  Redfish was tasty as well as the filet and Grouper.

11804,1,"Stratosphere just doesn't capture the Vegas experience very well. It's way to far to walk to the actual Strip. The rooms their are not impressive at all. I stayed here years ago when I first visited Vegas. A friend booked everything so I had no idea. It was cheap of course, but I would rather spend the extra and have the complete experience. Since then I've been staying at the Venetian/Palazzo, and I've never looked back. Oh yeah.... I gave them (stratosphere) an extra star because their buffet is pretty good for the money."
31588,3,Great taste I got the bacon burger it was amazing the place was clean and staff was friendly as for the price can't complain we will absolutely be coming back
24809,4,Loved every bite! And the staff was very friendly. Food came out quickly and tasted amazing! I will surely become a regular.
26186,0,"The girl at the door was unbelievably rude.\n\nThe fish was overcooked.  Really bad.  And we specifically asked before ordering, because not all places do fish well - and were told it was the best.  Nope.  The soup was ehh, and the cotton candy was fine.\n\nI can't remember giving another restaurant a one-star review.  But I really will never return and I tell everyone who asks not to go there.  Oh, and it's incredibly loud.  I assume they play the music so loud to disguise the conversation of the people sitting far too close to you (do they really need to jam that many tables in?).\n\nHorrible."
19116,0,"Sadly, I would give this company 0 stars, but that is not an option.  I needed an immediate repair through my home warranty Old Republic.  This is the one company that had time to do it right away.  The \""receptionist\"" aka owner Debra was extremely rude to my husband while scheduling the appointment.  She diagnosed the issue over the phone and said the dishwasher stopped working because we used liquid detergent (made for dishwashers.)  She then proceeded to tell us that the tech (I believe to be her husband) could not call us before his arrival as he doesn't get cell service in the Chandler area!  WTF?  She said he could show up any time between 10am and 6pm and if we weren't there waiting for them that they would leave a note on the door and not be able to service the appliance.  Tech arrives, answers cell phone while here, so apparently cell phone does work.......speaks with Debra and complains about the last customer in front of me.  He was rude and unprofessional.  When I told him I had already made a complaint to the home warranty company about Debra's service his response was \""I'm not worried about that\"".  I'm in real estate and LOVE Old republic home warranty.  I called the warranty company immediately and informed them of the situation.  They told me that this company will likely be removed from their list of providers for service.  Let's hope so.  I will follow up with Old Republic to be sure that this company does not get business sent their way when they obviously don't deserve it.  By the way............the repairs he made did not fix the problem, now the warranty company has to send a second company out to make the repairs.  Save yourself the headache and call a different company.  If you have a home warranty and they give your work order~ it is your right to decline this company and request another form their list of providers.  I have used this warranty company for many years for myself and for my clients.  This is the first negative experience I have had with one of their contractors, so I am confident that ORHW will discontinue their business relationship with Protech Appliance and Repair.  Spend your $$$ with a company that appreciates your business."
45847,3,"I've been going to Box for many years. (See my review from their old address on W. Sahara) When they moved I tried other wax places because they were closer to home but it just wasn't the same. I returned to Box, even though Brea's smiling face isn't around as often, it's still a fab place for a waxing. Courtney and Ashley do a great job keeping up the great Box reputation."
28430,3,"It's a pretty hole in the wall at the Tempe Marketplace.  I wish they'd be a little more consistent with their flavor selection.  Sometimes you feel like a mint and sometimes you do but they don't have it on that particular visit, meh.\n\nI digress from my 4-star rating.  The yogurts good, the topping selection is better, and more consistent, and the staff is as friendly as can be.\n\nOnly thing I'd change is its location in front of the child trap water pit where it seems like every time I visit, there's a toddler running around sans a diaper."
18385,3,"The lentil soup is the star of this restaurant.  I wish they sold it by the gallon.\n\nYou could say Fattoush is kind of a hole in the wall, which I appreciate in an ethnic restaurant.  The decor is eclectic and seems to embody the spirit of the family owners.  If you expect fancy you may be disappointed, but if you expect a delicious meal at a fair price you'll be headed back for more.\n\nTonight I had the Chicken Shawarma sandwich (seasoned and served in a pita with tomatoes, pickles, and sauce) which, served with soup or salad at $6.95, was a steal.  And the tiny cup of Turkish coffee was just right.\n\nThe service is good and definitely very friendly. \n\nFattoush fits right in on that magical stretch of 19th Ave. between Indian School and Camelback, among so many great diverse food spots."
46438,0,"Horrible. I went to the Scottsdale location. It was in the back of a store. The room was dirty. The guy was unprofessional. You sit in a red outside lounge chair, the guy applies the gel then the light. Then the guy trys to sell you toothpaste and other products. During my visit he proceeded to make telephone calls to other people including his friends and supplier. Lastly, the result was just ok. I paid for 3 applications but he only put some on my bottom teeth then some one my top teeth. I could have got the same results at home. Don't waste your money!!"

Anyways, I cleaned out my closet and came here and they literally took 1 pair of jeans out of maybe 40-50 items.  I mostly brought in some old work clothes from Banana Republic and just some odds and ends that no longer fit.  This place is solely for indy/punky/trendy, which they do make quite clear so they are what they say they are which is good.  Makes me kind of wonder how many people buy and sell back the same items though..."
42988,1,"Staff is very rude. Young people with horrible attitudes. A female party host worker yelled at my kids ton get out of her way. I told her I wanted to speak with her manager and she lied to him saying I cursed at her and I should be kicked out. On my sons bday in front of my children. I explained what happened to him and he literally just said \""ok, I'll look into that\"" in the middle of me explaining and walked over to her to hug her and started to joke and laugh about it. But he did make sure to follow me through the course and said if in cursed again I would have to leave. Embarrassed me in front of myn kids and everyone. They tried to make me feel uncomfortable the rest of my time there. Like teenage little bullies who were given to much authority to fast. This is my first and only visit. My kids love the place but I wont even take the chance to give them another opportunity to treat us that way. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE."
20083,0,"Apparently Soleil M. ways of handeling criticism is to BAN people from coming back to their establishments. Says a lot about their business ethic. \n\nUnfortunately, Yelp is here for HONEST reviewers, thats what this site is for. To let other members of the public know about YOUR particular experience at places you go to.\n\nI only stated an honest truth about our stay during our visit.  \n\nAlso, when you stay there, they also ask you to fill out a \""what can we do better\"" form. \n\nIf you dont want honest opinions from your customers, then why hand out those forms?  They want private communications of your opinions, but not public viewable ones? Of course not, because they dont want the public to see HONEST reviews.\n\nAgain, says a tremendous about their business ethics.\n\nI am happy to not step foot on one of your establishments again. Plenty of better companies to deal with.\n\nThank you."
34339,4,"We contacted A Perfect Fit Nanny to find a nanny for our 3 month old daughter. Having never needed a nanny service before, I was a little nervous and didn't quite know what to expect. I immediately felt completely comfortable after speaking with Jennifer. She explained the process and really took the time to get to know our family and our needs. Emily was equally awesome to work with as she was extremely quick to send me nanny profiles and always responded to my emails promptly. The nanny we decided on is absolutely wonderful and truly is \""a perfect fit\"" for our family. I would definitely recommend this agency to my family and friends. As a matter of fact, I have a friend who just gave birth a week ago and I've already told her this is definitely the place to use. After my experience with them, I honestly do not know why anyone in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area would ever use another agency as they are just that good!"

27623,2,"This new yogurt place at CityCenter of CityNorth is a nice addition to the area.  It's a do-it-yourself place, so you grab a cup, head to the yogurt machines, dispense however much yogurt you want, then put on your own toppings, put it on the scale, and pay by weight (39 cents/oz.).  Now, about the yogurt.  The flavor variety is a little disappointing.  They have original tart (a la Pinkberry, in LA, or Ice Tango, in AZ), pomegranate tart, vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and OJ.  Flavors may change, but this is what they had when I was there.  The \""regular\"" (i.e. non-tart) yogurt flavors were just okay -  I would make the trip to Golden Spoon instead, as they have the best and most variety of flavors.  But the tart flavors were very good - pomegranate was delicious, and the original wasn't quite up to Pinkberry standards (a little too icy, more like sorbet, although I prefer that to too creamy in a tart flavor), but still good.  They have a nice selection of toppings (fresh fruit, nuts, cereal, mochi, some other British stuff I'd never heard of), although it's always a little scary having it self-serve (salad bar style) so it sits out for people to get their germs on your food.  Overall, I think this place will do well, if for no other reason than it's the only yogurt place in the area, but I actually enjoy their tart flavors and toppings very much!"
2881,1,"I must've come here on a bad day considering all of the other glowing reviews. I've got two things to say about this place: \n\na) It's very affordable.\nb) Up until I visited this place, I thought pizza was like sex. That is, there's no such thing as bad sex. Well, the Floridino's pizza just kinda laid there.\n\nI should probably try it again, even though my first visit was underwhelming. One more minor note, this place also has a full bar and it's the first thing you see when you walk into the place. Not sure why that survey question has been answered differently by every other user."
43106,1,Very slow -- even without a lot of customers -- and very disorganized. You can't pay with the Starbucks app -- they have to take your phone and key in the number by hand!

With the mixture of yoga, ballet, pilates, and free weights, you will for sure feel the burn after your one hour class.  I love it that the instructor makes sure that you are doing the exercises correctly...not like other fitness classes that I attended.  The instructor does not frown upon the student when they either need a break or cannot do a certain exercise. Also, I do have issues with my back, and I feel that this type of exercise can definitely build the strength that I need to help.  I just have to build strength in my neck for some of the exercises.\n\nI am still trying to debate if I am going to by a package here. I have issues with my hand that affects me doing some of the challenges.  But they have specials for new clients and discounts for buying classes in packages.

40190,1,"I don't like leaving low ratings for stores but it seems that the Toy Shack is more a labor of love for the owners vs. a good, functional, vintage toy shop.\n\nPros: it exists.  Normally, vintage toys are things you already own from your childhood, or find in a yardsale.  You have to respect that they put together a whole store based on toys which are not produced any more.  In that sense, it's like an antique store, which you can not expect to have a consistent stock of product, but they do.\n\nCons: Prices are high and the employees seem a little crazy.  \n\nI went in the middle of the week and there was not a lot of traffic in the area.  There were only a few people in the store.  There was one employee, who was manning both the phones and the register.  I hung around for 20 minutes and as far as I could tell, nobody bought anything.\n\nIt seems to me that people who are into vintage toys might be a crazy bunch (a generalization you could also make about AD&D players, 'cat people', and furries). \nThe employee in the store was having a very loud conversation on the phone with a potential customer who would not leave him alone.  Then he proceeded to tell all of us that he is constantly getting phone calls from crazy people who won't let him get off the phone to deal with the customers in the store, and they leave poor online reviews because he won't talk to them for hours on end.\n\nThe employee proceeded to have a conversation with another customer about how they both experience frequent seizures.\n\nI asked about some Nintendo Game-N-Watch games which were severely overpriced (some were labelled with prices and some were not, but they were all locked in a glass case so I had to ask for help).\n\nThey really didn't have much in the way of video games, mostly 1990's figures etc.  They had some older stuff, but it was all locked in glass cases and there wasn't much of it.\n\nAll in all, I didn't find the store very interesting.  I guess the owner probably has a lot of older toys and a lot of information/experience in the vintage toy market, but that just doesn't translate into a useful/interesting/fun store.\n\nI feel like this store could be a lot better, but needs a little help or a makeover or something..."

I went there a few days ago and the wait was atrocious.  When I got to my table I was given a menu.  The food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out.  The waiter seemed too involved with tasks that I assume far surpassed customer satisfaction in importance.  At best, this was a drawn out version of an old, unmaintained, dirty Denny's.

12987,1,"A roulette dealer told me that the food quality in Vegas restaurants has really gone downhill, perhaps due to the rising meat prices. I came here in 2010 and had a lovely steak dinner. This time around I pondered trying something else so I inquired about the scallops. The waitress highly recommended them so I went for it. My friend ordered the chicken grand mere. Bread came promptly and was quite good, accompanied by whipped butter. We sat outside on a Tues early evening under a heat lamp and enjoyed the people watching. It was early enough to get a seat outside (around 6 I believe) as by the time we left the once-empty inside was full. Sadly my scallops, all four of them, arrived cold and were chewy and very bland. The squash pur\u00e9e was a cool temperature and there were only about five brussel sprouts on my plate. Good thing I'd eaten a lot of bread. I sent back the scallops and was told they'd be reheated. The waitress and busboy were very nice and caring. I have nothing bad to say about the service other than the waitress's bad call on the scallops. I was offered a complimentary refill of my rose champagne as I waited for my meal. Meanwhile my friend was pretty happy with his chicken but not in amazement by any means. It was juicy and was a good amount of chicken. Potato pur\u00e9e was tasty as were the roasted garlic and onions. Just don't expect very much of the sides. Scallops came back to me warmer but I had zero love for them. I ate them because I was hungry. They really really needed some kind of sauce. I think I know what rubber soles taste like now. It was my birthday and I was given a profiterole which was tasty. The two meals with two glasses of $11 champagne (not counting my complimentary one) plus tip came to $112. Disappointing since I'd felt like I had to force myself to eat the scallops. No enjoyment at all. Like several other places i revisiting on this trip after great experiences in 2010, I'm crossing Mon Ami Gabi off my list and will search for more consistently good places to patronize."
38042,4,Jimmy John's is the best.  The bread is always super fresh and chewy. The have super fast service and delivery. And I mean SUPER fast.  My sandwich was ready before I was done ordering.  Definitely go there.
47959,1,We were a party of 11 that went after a movie for brunch. \n\nPro: wait time was much less than told\nGreeting was friendly \nWaiter was friendly \n\nCon: seated 11 of us with 2 menus\n         On 3 different occasions they brought other people's drink to our table.  \nOur food took much longer to be served than it should have.\nThey brought out 3 entrees and the rest of the party's food came out 15 min later. \nThey forgot one of the kids meals. \nWhen the food finally came out it was cold. \n\nThis is my second time here and my first was also a hot mess. The first time it seemed like their Corp people were there and the staff was stiff and nobody smiled.  Food was cold and took forever.
13426,2,"The times I've been here they mainly play hip-hop and reggae. The cover price varies, but if you're interested, come early because the lines get loooong. They also have a nice lounge (smoking) area with a view of the Forums and drunk couples making out.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I went here again recently and I guess some clubs do have their dry spells. Came here and it was a sausage fest. When you see bouncers dancing on the dancefloor, you know it's not the place to be. Not only that, but they overpriced the drinks. Paid $30 for a cocktail and a beer. You'd think they'd lower the cover and drinks since the place was DEAD."
41887,0,"Dirty tables, soiled floors, and bad food.  According to a dated publication posted on the restaurant's wall,  it was the owner's long time dream to open a restaurant.  The publication shocks me for two reasons: the restaurant is dirty and the food is awful... that doesn't feel dreamy to me.   I ordered the sliders.  The wife ordered a turkey club sandwich.  Safe bets considering this is our first visit.  It was hard to find an open table and that's not because the restaurant was busy (at the top of the lunch hour, we were the only patrons)... we couldn't find a clean table.  I guess the dream didn't factor in employees who would rather drink lattes and watch football games than clean tables and floors.  Then came the food. The sliders were clumsily made, the onion straws were cold,  and the mac n' cheese was unseasoned and bland.  My wife's  sandwich was mediocre and  elementary (in my lazy college days, I made better sandwiches with half the sobriety of the restaurant cooks... granted I'm making a big assumption). In short, save your money and spare yourself the nightmare... find another spot."
9010,4,"Amazing!  From the first call to the time the installer left these people were great!   \n\nThey installed a dog door through my block wall.  Not even a scratch on the paint or a bit of dust left behind.  (They ever bring their own vacuum cleaner!)\n\nNow my lazy ass doesn't have to get off the couch to let the dog out anymore.   It took my puppy about 2 hours before he figured it out and now he loves freedom.\n\nA little expensive, but it's so worth it."
5192,0,This is a disgusting place which serves a what looks like an hour by hour hotel room.  Don't do it!!!!!!   The staff creepy....like something out of psycho.  Beware!!!!
14802,0,"Well, this is a first for me, in writing a review where the experience was so poor on entry to engaging the restaurant that I can't even comment on the food.\n\nTonight is our 10 year anniversary, so I thought it fitting that we go to an iconic location while in Las Vegas, The Bellagio.\n\nPrime is their center field front row top steak restaurant, or so they market themselves.\n\nThe idea is a traditional steakhouse in an ideal setting with indoor and outdoor dining while viewing the majestic Bellagio fountains.\n\nI took the time to call this afternoon and secure a late reservation (9:30pm) indicating clearly the importance of the date and asking for a special location.\n\nWhen we arrived, after walking through the Bellagio AKA Grand Central Station meets Disneyland's crowd, we approached the hostess stand.\n\nNow a restaurant selling itself as a top notch experience should have a direct human interaction upon entry, not two teenage girls working behind a desk.\n\nWorse, what clearly must have been the assistant manager walked past us, ignoring us on the way to take a phone call that was obviously more important than acknowledging their guests.\n\nWhile we stood there dressed in suit and my wife's beautiful gown, we endured the conversation that consumed the attention of both \""hostess\"" explaining to the fat man in shorts and an untucked polo shirt, that he was welcome to come in later but needed to wear pants.\n\nNow at this point I have to laugh at the irony. Clearly Prime's reputation is strong enough from a perception standpoint to bring clients in, and the stuffy 'dress code' is there to enhance the \""exclusivity\"" if you will. All the while the service is worse than the worst McDonalds restaurant. What a joke.\n\nWe finally connected with one of the hourly employees at the front counter and they proceeded to try to negotiate with me about wether we had actually requested an outside table or not. It was the equivalent of a conversation with a night club promoter about what it would take to get he table you want. Happy Anniversary I guess... \n\nThe good news is we went to the bar where a very friendly, competent and quality old school bartender provided real service. We ordered a glass of champagne, settled the check and informed person number 6 that I had to interact with that we would be going elsewhere.\n\nThey quickly back peddled, all of a sudden a front row table outside was available.\n\nI politely informed them that we would be going elsewhere.\n\nThe four employees were huddling around with the real manager and watching to see what we would do. I doubt they expected that I would take the time to share the truth about the experience on line.\n\nLook, here is the bottom line. When you are heading out to an expensive dinner, especially for an important event, and preparing to spend a considerable amount of money, you deserve the absolute best service and mentality. There's no entitlement here. Just because your restaurant is overlooking the Bellagio fountains doesn't mean it's automatically any better than a revolving restaurant exploiting its view to sell you overpriced food.\n\nThe restaurant is down stairs from the Bellagio Esplanade, it's a stuffy, dark, cave like environment with a very heavy small of cooked and worked over food. Think senior retirement center cafe with expensive decor.\n\nIf you want my advice, there are a dozen steak houses in town, all much better in every way. I would recommend the SW at Wynn or Carnevino at Pallazo. Of course I can't speak to the food since I couldn't stand the mentality. I can only tell you about the smell and the attitude. Both stink.\n\nTry the bar I guess then high tail it out of there before they take your cash and feed the snob beast.\n\nBetter luck elsewhere."
38692,2,"First impression... Walking up to the restaurant I was knocked back with an incredible aroma emanating from the patio/front door. You could tell that this place was cooking with some serious spices and flavor. My olfactory senses got turgid and my salivary glands prematurely evacuated themselves. I told myself I wouldn't let this happen again - I'm not even inside yet! Well, I peaked early and only once. I walked inside to some tacky d\u00e9cor and very average service. Cue rugs on the wall, and tequila bottle vases with fake flowers....\n\nAt first I found it humorous that the table was given a stack of plastic cups and a pitcher of ice water. Sure it's efficient but far from classy. The chips and salsa were lackluster in my opinion, while also being tongue crippling. Odd combo, right? All of those smells I encountered walking in - I was beginning to taste. There was a watery green tomatillo salsa and a dark red, obviously strongly roasted hot red salsa. Usually a fan of things spicy, I was amazed at how hot I found this to be. I imagined how many patrons would be put off by such a strong table salsa without request. Nonetheless I was confused by why my mouth was on fire but I wasn't finding an enjoyable delicious taste. Something didn't match up right. I don't know if my taste bros were too injured from the heat to notice to amazing flavor, or if it simply wasn't there. Some could argue that chips & salsa is the best litmus test of a Mexican restaurant. I decided to stave off judgment until food came. I was excited to try my entr\u00e9e. \n\nI ordered a #2 which was a chicken hard taco, a chicken and cheese enchilada + rice & beans. I instantly dove into the taco which was fantastic - truly one of the better and most simple tacos ever. The shell was thick and crunchy. It held together and provided a magnificent contrasting crunch and toasty flavor to the chicken which was definitely marinated and cooked nicely. All of the flavor came through and the marinade was warm but not overly hot. Off to a great start LDM! Beans and rice were good but not worth the trip. No bean choices were given and pinto were served. I realized quickly that this restaurant is a big fan of the Pinto bean. All plates on the table had some of these puppies perched somewhere or somehow. Not usually my bean of choice, but they were adequate. I recognized the dark roasted red color covering my enchilada. It was very similar to the table salsa that I already wasn't a massive fan of. I took a normal sized bite and after a few seconds delay quickly was requesting the pitcher of water be passed my way. I have no idea if there was really chicken or any other ingredients in the enchilada, because all I tasted was HOT. Same description as the chips and salsa: \""Something didn't match up right. I don't know if my taste bros were too injured from the heat to notice to amazing flavor, or if it simply wasn't there.\""\n\nMargaritas were ordered by some at the table, but not by myself. They looked like they were simply Mix + Tequila. Nothing award winning or notable, and certainly not deserving of a $10 price tag. I had the pleasure of seeing them before placing my non-order. I would definitely have been disappointed if I had received one. \n\nStephanie D. already gave this place an incredibly accurate review - so I immediately trust her. I'll take her recommendations and when I re-visit I'll try out the Chile Relleno with Adovada or the Chile Plate with Machaca. As I said, I know this place is using some phenomenal flavors and I am determined to find what dishes highlight it best. LDM is one of the go-to restaurants for my friends in the 'Tuke so I'm sure to return."
15595,0,"Wow what can I say. I mean for a diner in a casino/hotel how do you mess that up?  I mean I ordered the country scramble(Three Eggs Scrambled with Sausage, Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Served with Buttermilk Biscuits and Hash Browns) without cheese. How hard can that be? The FIRST time the order came out WITH cheese. The second time the cooks must have had a seizure with the salt shaker cuz my hash browns and scramble came out way to salty. So I flagged down the manager gave him back my plate and about 15 min later another plate came out. With the same CRAP. I mean really. How do you mess up hash browns? And don't restaurants nowadays tend to make their food a little bland so that people can add salt if they want it?  SO all I had was a small bowl of fruit and an english muffin.  Thankfully they didn't screw that up, no salt required.\n\nThe service was fine, actually pretty prompt (other than the third time my dish came out). Just stick to coffee, toast and fruit."
33362,0,I came in Saturday to buy my daughter a phone there were about 4 people ahead of me there was only 2 people helping anybody so 45 minutes later I ask what the wait time is and I'm told it will be at least another 45 minutes to receive any help so we left. Now today I figure ok maybe it was just the weekend so I go back to try again.. I am here 5 minutes after they open and there are 9 people ahead of me and again only 2 people helping anybody...... A store this busy you think would have more help. I asked the guy I checked in with how long the wait time is and he told me longest wait time he had had was 10 minutes so far. I wonder why???? They just opened do nobody could be waiting longer. Do I look dumb??? I can do math! Oh I'm so mad. It's time to start looking for a new place to shop because this place is a joke.
23680,4,"So I just moved to Glendale AZ from Los Angeles and was craving sushi. I did what I always do & looked on Yelp for nearby sushi places, because Yelp has always been the best tool for finding anything great. I was so delighted to see Yen Sushi was less than a block from my house and looked like the highest rated place nearby. I decided to check it out by myself for lunch. I am not a big fan of spicy food, so I was hoping there would be some great non-spicy sushi as well (because a lot of people on Yelp only spoke of the spicy rolls.) \n\nThe first thing I realized was that there was a lot of choices just for sushi & I liked how they were categorized baked, tempura, fresh, etc. I saw so many rolls that looked yummy, but they were expensive. I didn't like the prices so much, but for good sushi, you can't expect it to be super cheap...I'll have to try out the happy hour next time. I decided on the Hawaiian Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, and their California Roll.\nMy favorite was the Shrimp Tempura Roll..it was HUGE! So yummy & it came with tempura vegetables. The Hawaiian Roll is good; it is garlicky! I got the CA Roll because I figured if that was not good then I was S.O.L.  I now know that 3 rolls are waaaay to much for me. I am used to 6 pieces that are small. These are pretty big with 7 or 8 pieces! It cost me $27.00 for lunch which was more than I would usually pay, but now I know I can get away with 2 rolls to fill me up. I would definetly recommend this place anytime. I am excited to try the happy hour, but I will be bummed about the special rolls not being on sale, because those are my favs."
17279,4,"So this place was just awesome! Come prepared to spend some bucks though..we had all the reccomended dishes from fluke sashimi w/truffle oil and capers,softshell crab,garlic yellowtail, soy black cod w/foie gras,baked mussells w/butter aioli. We also did scallop hand rolls and kumamoto oysters(my wifes fav) too which is our favorite whenever we go japanese. All I gotta say is they know what they are doing here and you will not be dissapointed they aim to please your tase buds here for sure"
6197,0,"I want to like this place so bad because it is across the street and therefore the most convenience place to eat and drink for my entire building.  This place is horrible. The food is awful and the staff are all snotty.  I have tried to eat there so many times.  The grilled chicken tastes like rubber and is always burned, the bread is always stale and when you speak up to staff about it they give you an attitude like you are making it up.  The only thing positive at this place is their spinach dip.  I have seriously never had a worse experience with food, staff, or a Charlotte bar in total.  DO NOT GO HERE."
33118,4,"Before the Novocain had worn off today, I received an email from my dental hygienist with the following message:\n\nShauna,\n\nIt was nice to meet you today. I hope you recover well from the cleaning and treatment. Have a good day! \n\nNatalie\n\nAfter two years without dental insurance, and no means to visit their office, they remembered me and treated me just as courteously as if no time had passed. They explained that since I had come in on a Tuesday, I would be getting a different hygienist. Honestly, I don't remember my last hygienist but the gesture was meaningful nonetheless. As I bemoaned the gap in my teeth (hate it) Dr. Tim said, \""You have a great smile,\"" and he meant it. \n\nToday, I had three shots of Novocain and two hours of \""open wider\"" but I never felt rushed or pressured to get on to the next patient. We talked at length about my flossing habits and I was given an explanation of which floss is best for my particular bite. Dr. Tim is out of network on my insurance and I could not care less.\n\nYes, my tooth hurts and chewing is a bear but I sincerely believe Dr. Tim and his team care more about my teeth than I do. And I carry floss in my purse... \n\nIf you're looking for a new dentist, please check out Healthy Smiles. Even if he is not in your neighborhood, it is worth the drive.\n\n(PS: I'm generous on reviews but I feel strongly enough about this 5-star review to rethink previous generosities.)"
43327,4,Like some others I was skeptical because the base boards that I bought were so cheap in comparison to Lowe's or even lumber liquidators.  But the quality of the baseboards was great for the price and the service was good
40928,2,"We came here so my fianc\u00e9 could try ostrich but sadly they were out. So we ordered a wellness juice which is pretty good, he ordered a angus burger and I order a grilled veggie wrap ( because I'm vegetarian) and they gave me a grilled chicken wrap?? What? Chicken doesn't sound like veggie... And the jicama \""fries\"" are raw and taste like dirt. Additionally the cashier was kinda snotty to us. Seeing as it's our first time and we got some crappy service and a wrong order they get 3 stars."
27006,2,"The service is terrible and the sushi isn't good enough to compensate for it. Every time I have gone the order of at one of the people at the table was incorrect. The staff didn't check back but 3 times for the entire hour that we were there and I had to run my own food back because it was wrong. Even though it wrong twice, I gave up. It wasn't worth the hassle. I wouldn't go there if there were a decent place closer that I could talk my friends to change to because they still like going there for some reason...\n\nAMENDMENT: I have returned via the request of a close friend and the results were much improved. I found the food was better prepared and the service very friendly. Thanks for the improvement!"
37054,4,"I visited this unique little flower shop recently and was so impressed. The minute I walked in the door I could tell this was my kind of flower shop. It was clean, welcoming and the staff was so friendly and helpful.\n\nThis flower shop not only has great floral arrangements, it has really unique items for a special events, decorating or for gift giving! \n\nI'll be back time and time again!"
9648,2,"Located on Flamingo right next door to the Rio. it is in walking distance to the Las Vegas Strip if you like to walk , but it is not such nice walk (on a freeway overpass) . That being said this place is a bit of a gem. Very reasonable rates, although not the swankiest place in Las Vegas. Coast properties tend to have a lot of amenities, making them self-sufficient. In other words you can stay here, not leave and still have a great pick of restaurants and the like. So if you are on a budget and want something a bit laid back give this place a look. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"

35995,0,"Despite the bad reviews here on Yelp, I was in the area and craved chicken wings. \nGot the wings & tenders combo. Totally gross! The wings tasted like cardboard and the tenders tasted like dirty socks. It was soaked in oil. A cholesterol overdose. \nThe fries were ok. It was disgusting."
11026,0,"Wolfgang Struck out on this one.  7 member squad and nobody liked it.  Very bland, very boring.  We're all from NJ & NY so maybe that's why??  Wouldn't spend another dollar there again."
19682,3,"This hotel may not be convenient for visiting the strip, but maybe that can be a good thing. Sometimes, (at least for me) you don't want the hustle, bustle and glitz of the strip. Maybe you just want to relax, eat, drink and gamble. My stay at the South Point was very low key and I loved every minute of it. \n\nCheck in was swift and easy. There were no surprise charges, everything was explained to me beforehand (telephone reservation) and staff was very friendly.\n\nI was very impressed with the cleanliness of this hotel and casino. All throughout, the hotel looked tidy and newish. That made me feel at ease because I'm somewhat of a germaphobe, but at the South Point I didn't feel on edge in that respect. \n\nUnfortunately, the BF is a smoker and nagged me into booking a \""smoking room\"". Usually I hate this in Vegas because a \""smoking room\"" usually means the rooms smell bad, really bad--a stench that just never goes away. At the South Point, the \""smoking room\"" we stayed in didn't wreak of smoke and it actually had a nice view-- we could see the strip in the distance. Not too shabby. I appreciate that. \n\nI didn't take advantage of the amenities this time (spa, gym, pool), but I plan to return and take advantage. \n\nAs long as you don't mind being ten minutes from the strip and are not expecting an uber swanky place to stay, the South Point proves a great choice for accommodations."
34252,0,awful!!!!
27046,2,"Cargo is one of these places that I think might border on being just a bit toooo big, because often when I'm in here it just seems like this cavernous mammoth of a bar, with glass everywhere and a really frightening set of stairs that are not high heel friendly in any way. I crept up them the last time I was in, while clinging on to the handrail for dear life. However, other classier humans have probably mastered the art of walking up a flight of stairs in heels by now, so this scenario need not apply to those fortunate people.\n\nIt's hard to get an amazing atmosphere going in a place like Cargo, because it's unusual for it ever to be packed to the brim, which would therefore make it cosy, and I'm always one for a bit of cosy bar action. Not too cosy mind. God I'm so fussy. Anyway, it is very polished and sleek looking, and has loads of light coming into it because of the big windows, so it's a good place to go for summer drinks. It's also just off Lothian Road, so pretty convenient for grabbing a city centre drink, or if you're ambling over to the cinema and fancy a beverage on the way."
48234,3,"We tried this place after remembering that this new sandwich shop had opened.  We are glad that a Vietnamese sandwich shop is now closer to home.  The other reviews said they had a long wait so I was expecting it,  but there was no wait at all.  Maybe 2 minutes at the most.  That was a pleasant surprise.  We were the only ones there also. \n\nI had the sliced pork sandwich. #7.  I liked the way the meat was seasoned.  The veggies tasted fresh.\n\nWife had the Mekong special.  #11. We tried each other's sandwich. She liked hers better and I like mine better.  The difference between us is I like to taste the meat in the sandwich I eat.  She is happy with tasting veggies. \n\nI would definitely come here again and recommend it."
11211,0,"The worst gym/playroom. The fact that the employees are actually being paid to do nothing and sit on their cell phones as they \""Greet you\"" same with the front desk.\n\nI don't pay extra for you to watch my daughter play in the fucking water fountain! It's sad you have about 2 \""employees\"" to over see maybe 5-10 kids tops and it still doesn't happen, when Rainbow & 95 location has about 5-6 employees and tends to about 50-70 at all times.... Get your shit together Henderson!\n\nAlso your personal trainers...need some training them selves.\nSloppy ass Gym."
9543,3,"I like this Starbucks location...\n\nThe workers are typically polite and efficient. They are also yet to screw up one of my orders! So I will continue to get my morning coffee here, since the Tropicana and Decatur store is disgusting and slow! \n\nTwo thumbs up!"
43268,3,"Who can say no to their $2 Signature dogs on Tuesdays? Well of course those who don't eat pork for dietary or religious reasons, but they should reconsider.\nThese hot dogs are delicious. I'm slowly working my way through the plethora of amazing options and then they go and make a weekly rotation of local brewery inspired hot dogs.\nThey seem to constantly be thinking up new ways to dress up the traditional frank. Grilled to perfection and with a myriad of options.\nThey also have great house chips and onion rings.\nI usually do take out but it is a great location to sit and grab a beer with your hot dogs and during these Spring evenings, they have the roof top patio."
24071,2,"Running is a good way to sweat out yesterday's booze. That's science.\n\nSo, in training for my first half marathon, I realize it's new-shoe time. And since my last few pairs of Asics were sale-rack Sports Authority numbers, I decide to enlist some professional help. A friend's recommendation sends me to Road Runner, where they have some fancy gizmo to help me find the perfect shoes. \n\nOne catch: It's in Tempe Marketplace. \n\nI brace myself for the onslaught of '90s one-hit-wonder pop songs as I open the car door. My head hurts already. At least there aren't any sullen high school kids in sight. \n\nLet's get this over with.\n\nShoe salesmen are always a bit creepy (I'm looking at you, Fashion Square Dillard's). But Road Runner's employees manage to mix the traditional sleazy shoe guy with a running nut. In other words: even creepier. And definitely with more unnecessary pep. \n\nThey chat me up, size my feet, test my pressure points and put me on a treadmill barefoot. Forty-five minutes later, I'm out the door with the same shoes I probably would have picked on my own. \n\nNext time, I'll wear the new pair out. So I can run to the car."
46910,0,"Do not go here, they charge too much for what you get and rip you off with the ion foot detox, which is a total hoax, these guys should be put out of business."
38328,1,"This restaurant I give it a 2 star, its a real nice place small and cozy and very clean!!!! They serve there food in big white elegant plates. The food is ok not the best."
47268,3,"The staff does a great job of staying pleasant while being swamped and dealing with families. The food is very tasty - the BBQ bacon burger really hit the spot. The burgers are roughly a half pound, the applewood-smoked bacon is cooked just right, and the BBQ sauce is sweet. The fries and onion strings are not really seasoned but there is a sauce bar with a wide range of selections to make them tastier. There is currently a special shake: the kitchen sink. Highly recommend it as it tastes like every candy bar you want to have in your pantry was put in the blender. If it's just you and one other person, consider sharing a large side as it's enough to enjoy but too much to fill up on and miss out on the shakes, floats, sundaes! Seating can be tricky on colder days as there are a few tables and booths inside and they are placed close together for maximum possible occupancy. There is a sizable outdoor patio for outdoor seating. We will definitely be returning to this place for burgers, fries, and shakes."
14138,1,"Unfortunately I have to say even though this is a pretty nice Hotel, the fact that I was placed in a room with a window facing the Parking Structure and the stairs right in my face was a terrible experience, especially since I had to wake up early in the morning to the sound of people going up and down the metal parking stairs. That room should not even exists, and even if it does it shouldn't be assigned to anyone on a Sunday night when obviously 90% of the rooms were empty!!! Also there was weird noise coming out of the toilet pipes. \n\nEverything else was good but the kind of room I was in needs to be the last room given out, along with a warning from the front desk about it having a parking garage view with super loud stairways right in your ears!! I was going to ask to be moved, but had to walk a good 5-7 minutes all the way to the edge of their east tower just to get to that room, too tired to complain, and I shouldn't be the one to tell the receptionist about these things anyways!\n\nThis place is pretty far from the Strip by the way, in case that is why you're going to Vegas, make sure to calculate $50 cab rides, each way, to the Strip into your budget. Although apparently there are some shuttle services available.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the awesome pool area. Lots of room to hang out and have a fun day out in the sun.\n\nI only had a one night experience, and it was not a good one; disappointing enough to make me write this review! As a business, most of the time you only have one chance with a potential customer, and this one was lost."
28505,1,"As of  our last visit in September 2009, this restaurant still comes up short. My meal was not memorable, and the only thing my husband remebered was the main course of pork, which was quite good. The crab cake appetizer was a mess. The beet salad was puny, but good flavor. I won't beat the dead horse with a stick.  If  menu offerings and prices don't  change,  there could be another vacancy in DC Market--very unfortunate for us who live in north Scottsdale."

40948,1,"Great for breakfast. Bad for lunch.\n\nBreakfast items tend to be good (though, oddly, bagels seems to be an afterthought). I like the Huevos Rancheros. My friend likes the Western Omelet. Lots of free refills on drinks. Quick and friendly service.\n\nHowever: \nLunch/Dinner items are heavy on the pre-fab, deep fried side. \n\nExample: I ordered the special of the day \""Fish and Chips\"".\nThe fish was two processed squares of what you might get in a McFood Filet-o-fish. The \""chips\"" were standard frozen french fries (not even steak fries). Bleh..\n\nAnother example: the Chicken Parmesan was little deep-fried, battered chunks of Chinese fast-food style chicken served on watery pasta. Really not good.\n\nI would like this place to do well because it is a convenient place for me to get a quick and hearty breakfast - but they'd better get their lunch game up to speed."
9126,4,"Honest, friendly, knowledgeable, fair, and polite. I get a little nervous when someone else works on my vehicle. They allowed me to watch the whole process. When their original diagnosis was wrong they went to option b and didn't charge me for the unneeded replacement. They usually very busy, but we'll worth any wait."
32643,4,"I've been to this place several times and used to stop in regularly after work when I worked in the city. Cheap drinks, good pool players, darts and it's pretty central in the Strip. Different days certainly has different crowds - weekdays are more service industry folks and the weekends usually get a rowdier group (from what I've seen). Never had a bad time in there and will definitely be going back!"
30551,0,"Decided to stop in because of the signs around the area. The front staff is not friendly at all. I'm not even sure why they are checking people out. Very cold. Also not impressed with my cupcake. The price for a standard size cupcake with store bought frosting that was slightly over cooked, was a rip off!!! I could have made my own cupcakes, saved money and not have to have dealt with bad attitudes!!!  Not worth it at all!"
48197,0,"DON'T EAT HERE!!!!! So, we ordered 3 things, 2 were terrible! My $18 salad had brown lettuce, literally. Brown. So I sent it back, the next one tasted just terrible. So I didn't eat any of the salad, just the chicken on top. At least they only charged me for the chicken, not the salad. Sweet potato fries were cold. Sent them back, the second batch was ok. Boyfriend's burger was ok. Also extremely loud and slow. :("
2768,3,"I love that this Dunkin' Donuts has a drive-thru. I wish other Dunkin' Donuts would follow their lead. This location is very convenient for me as it's near a gas station and just off the freeway. Somebody said they had slow service here. I've never had that problem. Took my husband here for a little breakfast date. Yes, we actually set the alarm and went here around 9AM. Love the donuts and the donut prices. Love that they have coolattas and pumpkin-spiced coffee near Halloween. Love the selection of donuts. I just wish the coffee prices were a little less and that's all that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Love the breakfast but I think you should get two breakfast wraps for a buck, not just one. This place is staffed by responsible teenages. It's a clean location with clean bathrooms."
33924,3,Our doggies Joey and Fred have been coming to Grand Montecito since it opened 3 years ago. We board them at the kennel about 3 times a year. The staff is very kind and considerate to our two dogs who are getting up there in years especially our geriatric cranky beagle. \n\nWe are huge fans of doctor Lewis who has shown great compassion toward both our hound who is in the sunset of his life but also our family with 4 children for whom when the time comes losing their beloved dog they have grown up with will be very difficult. \n\nI know that when the time comes our children trust that Dr. Lewis has done everything he can to help this member of our family which will make saying goodbye just a little bit easier. Our family has the peace of mind that our pets are well cared for when we have to be out of town.
25196,0,"This was my second time going to JET. The first time was fun. Maybe because it was a GQ private party before they opened it to the public. It was open bar and they had a band before the DJ came. This time . . . was AWFUL!!! Those things behind the bars are the rudest people I've met. The night that we went, they were doing a promotion for Skyy vodka, so ladies drank free (with coupons) skyy drinks until midnight. I asked the first bartender what type of drinks I could get. She said \""any\"" Skyy vodka drink. I then asked for a cosmo. She took my drink coupon and then rudely said, \""You can't have that.\"" I told her that you just told me that I could have \""any\"" Skyy vodka drink.She said, \""Not that\"". I ended up getting a vodka & cranberry because she was sooooo rude, I wanted to yell at her. Then my date ordered his drink. He asked her something about brown liquors. She yelled at him, \""This is a full bar! We have everything here! What do you want?! We ended up walking away because we both wanted to curse her little scrawny butt out at that point. \n\nThe next bar wasn't any better. It seemed that the drink coupons were like the \""kiss of death\"". Once the girls saw them, the attitudes came. It was like since you are not paying for the drink, you don't deserve good service. Plus they were NOT even serving us Skyy vodka! They were using the house brand. They poured it from the spout and I know that Skyy was NOT the house brand. After 4 watered down drinks and no buzz, I BOUGHT a martini with Skyy vodka. BIG DIFFERENCE! I actually saw her pick up a skyy bottle to make the drink. I know that the free drinks weren't going to be the best, but I didn't expect the rudeness. I am never going back to JET. The service was extremely poor. Those bartenders were the worst! They should all be fired."
37442,3,"Located at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets - South.  It's a bit small, but it has a decent selection of toys and the prices were GREAT.  We were able to find Octonaut figurines (if you don't have kids who watch Disney Jr., don't bother asking what this is) that we weren't able to get at home and which were much more expensive online.  Win - win!  Plus the employees were friendly and attentive."
4450,0,Me and my wife stopped by the place because of a 20 dollar groupon that we bought because we were checking out that sweet theatre next door. So we went to there cafe. After being seated we were ignored for a good hour. Even trying to flag anyone down was impossible. The waiter just walked by us as if we weren't there. Finally a bus boy took our order. Salad bar was good. Then they messed up on my check and charged me full price on my card. Completely ignoring my groupon. I will never come here again. No wonder there so dead inside.
23437,0,"So, I have been to Pearl a few times now. The first time, it was ok, nothing spectacular but I liked the prices. The 2nd time- horrible. The spicy tuna roll tasted very strong, like fish that was NOT fresh at all. The other rolls we got were falling apart. The service was crappy.\nWelllll, I decided to give it another try because I had a certificate from restaurants.com for there. So, I grab 2 of my friends and we head that way. We sit down, one friend goes to the restroom. I am sitting with a friend from Chicago who has never been there so she has no idea what they are about. A girl walks over with the 3 menus they have (sushi, appetizers, and drink menus). This girl HAS TO BE either drunk or stoned... She asks if we have been there before and I let her know I had but my friend was new. She then says that she is just helping, not our waitress, and if our waitress doesn't explain the menu, I can....what???! So, she wants ME to explain the menu to my friend??? Weird. Anyway, finally our server comes, we order 2 miso soups and an edaname. The stoned girl who is \""helping\"" brings 1 soup and the edaname. I politely say that we had an extra soup when she had a chance...She then looks at me strangely and asks \""Did you order it with your server?\""....Really??? So, we order our food, one friend orders a beer. The beer comes out with ice in it?? The food comes....horrible. The fish is very strong again. I got yellowtail and it was very mushy and tasted suuuper fishy. My friend had a shrimp tempura roll that fell apart everytime she dipped in soy. I couldn't even eat mine... finally we want the bill. Server is no where to be found until we see her chatting with another table. Fine, thats her job to be friendly...15 minutes later we ask the bartender if we can get our tab and he acts like we are being jerks. Moral of the story...Pearl Sushi, I gave u 3 chances... thats enough. Get some fresh fish... I know your menu is cheap, but I'd rather pay more for good fish. Also, get some servers who are a little more professional and experienced. And do some drug tests while you are at it."

28142,2,"Solid breakfast food served in generous portions for a reasonable price! Waitresses were quick, friendly, hard working and accommodating. We couldn't help but laugh at the strange old man pointing patrons to their designated seats and muttering \""you're welcome\"" even if they hadn't addressed him. Not an essential fixture while travelling in Montreal, but a charming little place nonetheless, and a proper diner if it's on the way and you have a large appetite for breakfast food. I would recommend their signature \""Mish Mash\"" omelette - especially as a hangover remedy!"
34781,2,"The wait took a little bit at 10:30 AM, even though there were no other customers there. I came in here just for a smoothie and was surprised to find they served sandwiches (breakfast and lunch all day). \n\nI thought the sandwiches were mediocre. I think the sandwiches are something you can definitely make at home even without a panini press. Cheese and ham between two slices of bread isn't really going to wow anyone. The smoothie was decent. I think I have had much better elsewhere. I had the coconut one, BTW. My total was $12 for two sandwiches & one smoothie.\n\nOn a positive note, the place was clean and there was a running PC in the dining area just in case you needed to check your Facebook or something. :-P"

(I've been to 7 different ones.)\n\nGranted, I wouldn't say they are the best, but one of the guys there (I cant remember his name for the life of me) was so attentive and always had a smile on. :)\n\nOne of the best starters to my birthday celebration ever!"
3032,2,"A Sunday brunch connoisseur cannot ever get blown away by this place. \n\nI will not complain about the ambience, it is indeed pretty. But I'm definitely not going to vouch for the food here. I don't know if this has something to do with the Chandler location but nothing on the menu is upto the mark.\n\nWhen you look at the menu it sounds grander than it actually is. Believe me when I say that the pancake or french toast looks far more appetizing at IHOP. I'd suggest that you spend 10 mins preparing the Potato and Leek packet soup (by Knorr) at home rather than taste any of their creamy soups.\n\nDuring the shopping season they put novices behind the cash counters and take inordinately long to serve a plate that totally falls short of your expectations.\n\nA strategic location or good interiors does not make for a good restaurant!"
43623,1,Well the chips and salsa were good while it lasted now been waiting 15 minutes for refills on our sodas and chips. I had to get up and find our server just to get those and he seemed upset that I even asked. Waiting on our food order to come which was taken about 20 more minutes. Oh did I mention we waited for a table for 25 minutes when they said 10 then we get shoved in the corner with a loud family blehh
8326,2,"This place is nice but nothing outstanding. If you are looking for a place to go and get pampered this is not the place for you. The pool is nice and the hot tub is pretty large and awesome.  \n\nThe only restaurant on the premises is a small snack shop by the pool which has sandwiches and such. The rooms have kitchens which provide what you need if you want to make your own food while you are there. There is a breakfast provided from 8-8:45 two days a week which is nice but isn't out for long after the 8:45 end time. During that time you are presented different activities and excursion type stuff you can do in the area.\n\nThe concierge is definitely helpful as they recommended a good breakfast place (though there are others) and helped us get a tee time at a discounted rate at a nice course nearby.\n\nAssuming you have a car, going to Sedona is a must and is a pretty drive up there. Also interesting if you are adventurous and are comfortable driving on unpaved roads in the mountains is driving the Apache Trail which goes out to Tonto National Forest and Roosevelt Lake.\n\nI would likely go somewhere else if I went back to Scottsdale as I wasn't blown away by the place, but it depends what type of vacation you are looking for. The place was clean but the maid service didn't really do much."
22433,2,"i love how late this place opens, as most places are in Vegas. Lots of taiwanese food, but unfortunately, the food tastes so-so. the only reason i went back multiple times is because they serve stinky tofu, a dish very hard to find in the Southeast."
3985,0,Wish I could give them zero stars. The other reviews are spot on. They don't want your business. They refuse to honor Subway coupons. The employees act rude and condescending. Their prices are more expensive than other Subways in the area. I'd recommend the Subway at 51st and Olive if you're looking to eat at Subway in this neighborhood. Avoid this one at all costs!
38688,0,i just recently called to enquire about calories and the person who answered (a guy) was very rude. first he could not make a estimation about how much calories are in the plate. when i explained to him while talking politely make an estimation of how much calories was in a small plate vs. a large plate the person rudely hung up. he could have given me a number and it would have been all good but now i decided not to go there.
45695,4,"Went to Ryu for the second time tonight and I have to say that this place is legit! The kids and I had Teppanyaki and the wife had sushi. Tonight was probably the best experience I have had at a Teppanyaki joint ever, outside, of the one in Tokyo where the chef was, I assume, an actual ninja. Anyhow, the chef tonight was awesome. He did all the usual gags that the kids love ie... The onion volcano and the beating fried rice heart but he also displayed some excellent knife skills. Way above and beyond anything I have seen here in the states. My kids really enjoyed him throwing shrimp into their mouths from across the table. So the entertainment was really good but what about the food? Food was amazing too, seriously, it was much more flavorful than my average experience at a Teppanyaki place, which is usually Benihana in Chandler.  The veggies were way more than the typical cucumbers, mushrooms and onions. Those were there but also broccoli, potatoes, and a nice helping of spinach cooked on the grill in sesame oil. I had the filet and chicken combo. The filet was cooked to a perfect medium/rare just as I requested. The kids meals were plentiful and neither of them could finish. The wife had a couple of different kinds of sushi and said they were excellent. I had one piece of some roll that had jalape\u00f1o, avocado and some other stuff. I thought it was good and I don't ever eat sushi. As I said before, this is the second time we have gone to Ryu. First time was fine but it was also right after the place opened. This time, all my expectations for this experience were definitely exceeded. Will be choosing Ryu over Benihana in the future."
34770,0,"Maybe I'll delete this when Echo uses their website to accurately depict when lunch is served.\n\nI walk in at 2:06 under the wild impression that lunch is served until 3 (\""First, the lunch menu is offered from 11am to 3pm\"" - echo website) and am informed the kitchen closes at 2. I promptly feel like an ass hat for bothering to do my homework, but am too hungry to question it. Rather than seeing if they can find the virtue in their hearts to push the newly established limit by six minutes, I high tail it out as fast as my car can get me to D'lish. \n\nDisappointment can often be remedied by a good tuna sandwich, but I wanted that disappointment to be nonexistent and that good tuna sandwich to be from Echo. Life is hard sometimes... this does not need to be one of those times. \n\nUpdate the interweb page, y'all."
11082,3,"Made this stop our last stop on our Vegas vacation before heading back home to  San Diego. Smart choice. The food satisfied our appetite! I ordered the adobo fried rice omelette, my daughter had the topsilog plate, my husband had the local plate...all were yummy. Fried rice portion is huge! The only thing I would change is the teriyaki chicken...it seems like it was fried and teriyaki sauce poured over it. Nothing compares to authentic food from hawaii, but Aloha Kitchen is pretty close."
22678,0,"Fail.\n\nThey serve food till midnight, so we rolled through here at 11 PM on a First Friday. \n\nThe waiter kept forgetting things we asked for... water, menus, etc. \n\nFrench fries - oops chips - tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. Cool and mushy... not my idea of a good chip.\n\nMy clam chowder was kind of thin though it tasted OK. It was lacking potatoes. Kinda weird. \n\nOrdered a Strongbow cider on tap... and it's flat. Since the server was nowhere to be found, I went up to the bar. Bartender: \""Oh the cider is usually a little flat! Don't worry about it!\"" (WHAAA???) Me: \""No - it's really flat. I think my water is fizzier.\"" Turns out it was the bottom of the tap and there's none left, and they aren't opening another till the next day. So no drinkey drinkey for Adam. Fail! \n\nFriend ordered some sandwich, she seemed to like it but it didn't look too thrilling to me. So whatevs.\n\nThe wine list was pretty shallow. Other friend ordered some \""fruity tart\"" type flavored white wine. She said it was \""tinny\"" tasting and not good. Fail.\n\nThe pool table takes up way too much room such that it's impossible to sit around the wall and not be poked by sticks. After being poked 3x by this daft fool I tapped the back of his cue ball and messed up his shot on purpose, because I was about to get it in the ribs. \n\nThe paintings of the Queen and Churchill kind of suck, in a 7th grade kind of way. It looks like Queen E's hair is floating slightly above her head. \n\nI will not be back!"

21583,1,"I have been a member here for 15 years. I have always been disappointed with the locations, they are just not convenient for me.However, I have always been a happy cusotmer. A few weeks ago I had to make a deposit and cash a check. I went to this location and I had never had a bad experience before. I went through the drive-thru and it was about 5-10 minutes before they closed. I placed the checks in the tube with my license. The women seemed annoyed because one check needed an additional signature. I did as she asked and passed it back to her. Then she said she needed a signature for the cash and she sent everything back through the tube. I asked if there was anything else and she said no, so I drove off and went about my business. Later that evening I discovered the women had kept my license. Given we were going out for New Years, I probably needed that! So the next morning we went down to the branch, we were about 20 minutes before they opened. I noticed workers in the windows and went to the door and docked. There were 4 employees, they all ingnored me. I did finally get one person's attention and when I did I jestured and yelled through the doors that I needed to get my license.  He seemed to acknowledge me; but I didn't get a response. So I went back to the car and I got a piece of paper to write the employees a note. When I returned to the door and held it up, the man that looked at me with a blank stare had my license and made a 'one minute' hand gesture. He came over and slipped it through the crack of the door, he wouldn't even open the door or speak to me. \n\nI was highly annoyed, someone could have come to the door and acknowledged me and said they would get the license, but instead they were very rude. I made a trip way out of my way to get something that wasn't returned to me, and an honest mistake I am sure; but at the same time, I am very disappointed in the employees behavior."
48297,1,"This place is probably a love it or hate it.  It's kind of a cross between Zombie and Goth.  It's pretty much a bar with a them and a small place to dance.  Not my scene but I'm sure others would like it and for a local watering hole, it adds a little variety."

23983,0,"I suppose when I saw the \""bigeye tuna pizza\"" as being the best dish at this restaurant I should have figured it would be subpar sushi joint.  I have no idea why this place gets so many good reviews but I guess with Vegas being a big tourist area most people reviewing this place have no clue what good sushi tastes like...especially a reviewer that states there is no place better in California!!? I live in Southern Cal and some of the best sushi I've had has been in the LA area i.e. Sasabune, Mori etc. But I'll simplify to specifics:\n\nService:\nSucks...lots of staff running around serving people with way too much money and food takes forever.  \n\nSushi:\nWe tried the bigeye tuna pizza and I guess it was decent...nothing to call home about. As for the sushi...I never knew they could cut sushi so thin and charge so much money.  I don't mind spending money on sushi but throw me a bone and at least make it hearty!? I can't believe they call themselves a sushi joint. I guess Bellagio can get away with charging that much for people that don't want to leave the hotel. The rolls were tiny and mediocre tasting. Usually my wife and I are fighting for the last piece but at Yellowtail we were fine leaving the overpriced food.\n\nAmbiance:\nI kept reading about being sat by the fountains which is why I chose the place. But the first thing you see on the site \""patio seating is very limited and you are not guaranteed a spot\"" Well figures...when we walked in it was packed and we got seated in the middle area which basically defeated the whole purpose of us eating there. It's basically a club that serves sushi.\n\nSummary:\nA white washed sushi joint for people with too much money.  Lesson learned...Vegas is not the place for sushi...should have listened to the other reviewers. I wish I would have spend my time and money at a restuarant like Joel Rubichon or Bouchons or even just the buffet.  Won't go back. I spent $190 for an appetizer 2 drinks, a couple rolls and a couple pieces of mediocre sushi. I have to give it one star of the cost of food and not meeting our expectations."
35577,2,"Wasn't to impressed with there bacon & cheddar sandwich. The bacon was cold,eggs were mediocre,cheese tastes nasty. I asked them to toast it,they didn't. It tasted like they put it in the microwave for 10 seconds. The only thing that was good was the asiago bagel."
37754,0,"Please note, this is my very first review of any kind.. I visited this sushi bar today with my son because he bought a 1/2 off groupon - off we went!\n\nVery nice place, great ambiance... I was impressed, however wise enough to know that books AND restaurants shouldn't be judged on the surface. I frequent many sushi bars and some of the best sushi I've eaten can be found in much less elegant of establishments - don't be fooled!\n\nWe ordered 5 maki rolls to start:\n\n2 from their 'signature' menu (firecracker roll and the madi gras roll)\nI love spicy food of all kinds - the firecracker roll was just HEAT, no FLAVOR, big upset. The madi gras roll was plain and flavorless. You'd be hard pressed to find a piece of lobster in there and they must have run out of cilantro because no tasty herb anywhere!! Keep in mind, these are signature rolls, $12+ a roll. \n\nThe other 3 rolls were from their 'traditional' selection.. We got the following:\nLas Vegas roll - ok, the sushi to rice ratio was about 20/80, not impressed at all.\nEel roll - eel?? Where was the eel? \nSpicy scallop roll - Zero spice and quite frankly it tasted like mushy rice.. The consistency was way off... Also take note that these 'traditional rolls' are no bigger than a quarter in diameter, very small for almost $10 per roll, ridiculous!!\n\nOur waiter saw my puzzled look as he brought out these rolls and never once asked if there was a problem or how our food was when he brought the check.. Which brings us to $$\nOur total was $55 for the most ridiculous lunch I've ever had.. Thanks, or NO thanks to the Groupon, we then owed $25 for really NOTHING more than an upscale environment!\n\nSave your time and spare your disappointment by passing up this joint!\nMy recommendations for great sushi, Blue Wasabi, Sakana and The Sushi Room.  Happy eating!"
19596,3,"A little bit of goodness right around the corner, literally. Whenever I am having a bit of a craving for some down home tasty goodness (like my favorite grilled cheese in town), I head to Chloe's Corner. The American Grilled Cheese is ah-mazing and should not be missed. I like to order and sit at the counter for lunch. Partner that grilled cheese with a bowl of their fantastic tomato soup and you have a bit of heaven on your lips. When you walk into Chloe's Counter, you are immediately greeted by a barrage of wines, old time candy jars, and 'small town' restaurant feel. I love this place for so many reasons, but one thing you MUST not pass up (aside from the American Grilled Cheese) is the malt milkshake, trust me chock up the extra 50 cents for the malt, it is so worth it! Dare I say one of the best chocolate milkshakes in town? I think so."

22473,0,"So here I am, me and two of \nMy bfff's..just got done golfing 18 holes in 108 degrees. Needless to say we're all starving and thirsty.. After what felt like an hour we finally decided on some BBQ. Now we know plenty of hidden BBQ gems  throughout Phoenix but today we decided on Lucile's. So we get there and be bolt right intothe bar section due to the fact the NFL preseason game is on and it's not packed like the regular dining area. So we get greeted by our waiter, I ask him a simple question \"" what's the difference between tri-tip and brisket?\"" he replies confidently, \"" tri tip is a leaner cut from the muscle in the back, and brisket is a shoulder cut, which has more fat. Both very good'\"" he added.so I go with the tri tip, my one friend gets the brisket and the other gets a steak. ...out comes the food.. Surprisingly mine looks like the brisket along with my buddies, but mine is cut differently. I ignore the appearance and dig in. I immediately notice the amount of fat throughout each cut. I think to myself \"" did this fucker mess up my order?\"" I ask my friends and they just think I'm talking out my ass but I know my cuts of meat and this shit ain't no tri-tip. So I ask a random Waiter what my dish looked like to him and he said tri-tip! WTF?? Hmmm that's weird! Now my friends really think I'm talking out my ass but I know\nI'm right, this is not what I ordered. I start thinking crazy thoughts like \""is this some\nSort of tri-tip Conspiracy?\"" I continue to eat what I did not order flabbergasted.. ..out come the check...the waiter begins passing out the checks since we had them separated. He passes the steak check to friend 1. Passes brisket check to friend 2. Now he passes mine without looking. I immediately open to see BRISKET. I experience mix emotions. I am pissed because I Knew he had fucked up And I'm happy Because I just confirmed I'm not crazy and I really\nDo know my cuts of meat! I notice my waiters name \""Tad\"" and understood why he didn't tell us his name. I bring this conspiracy up to Tad and he stated \"" I'm so sorry man do you wanna see my boss?\"" I reply \""no thank you\"". Overall I confirmed the staff at Lucile's do not know there cuts of meat and their bar service is really poor. Eat in the dining room and watch out for Tad bc he sucks."

The bartender was friendly and drinks were extremely affordable.  \n\nI'm not sure that I would go out of my way for PHI but if I was in the area and looking for a cheap drink then why not now that I know where it is!"
11810,3,"I stayed here for only one day and let me tell you,,, I had a blast!!!!\n\nI was in Vegas for three days and had a better night at the starts than Luxor.\n\nGranted I spent less at this hotel but got a better room than in Luxor: \n\nPros: \n\nAll renovated rooms (except for the old tower) if you pay a little more you can get a suit for half the price the other strip hotels charge. Stratosphere did not have the room I ordered available so they gave me a suit instead. It was incredible! 800 sq feet of luxury. \n\nClose to Fremont street and pawn stars shop.\n\nUnlimited tower visitations.\n\nUnlimited bar from  4-10 for 20 bucks at the bar.\n\nMuch cheaper prices than strip:\n\nCons:\n\nFar from the strip: however it's closer to circus, encore, and treasure island. \n\nNeed to get taxi for transportation. However it's worth it. \n\nImportant note: don't believe all the people who post negative comments. I thought it was going to be a bad experience and it was not at all. If you have high standard than stay at the palazzo!!!"
3640,3,"Came here to watch the special screening of Phoenix lights, but the tickets sold out! Ended up watching 300, rise of the empire and the theater it was playing in was just so small! The sound was really good. Theater 11 was the theater the movie was in. It kind of reminded me of a small classroom in college with a power point presentation at the front of the room, haha. The staff was friendly though and it was a very clean theater, with the heavenly smell of freshly popped popcorn permeating throughout the theater"
45122,4,"Saw the Rock of Ages show in April. Hands down in the top 5 musicals ive ever seen. First up we were supposed to see the show Human Nature which i have been wanting to see forever it was canceled 3 hours b4 showtime, Rock of Ages was starting at the same time and the lady at the box office gave us a very good price for 3 tix. Me and my daughters who are in their 20's knew every song and sang along very loudly. The venue was nice a bar right next to the stage. The music and singing were out of this world and very good actors, we had so much fun didnt want it to end. The 80's was my time and it definately took me back to a carefree fun time it was like being at a party. I will be seeing this one again."
12630,1,"The Mirage is OK but this review is more about their gym, or lack thereof.\n\nHow can you have a resort hotel this size, with massive conference facilities, and have a gym that's so tiny?  The gym consists of 6 treadmills, 5 stairclimbers, and 5 cross trainers.  And 2 of the machines were broken.\n\nAnd there was a line out the door.  Sooooo lame!"
44746,4,"Absolutely love this place!!!! I would (and have) recommended many people here for the best airbrush tan. Donna is all around great - she always recommends the best color for you, makes you feel comfortable, and gets you in and out . The price is perfect and there are even deals! This is definitely my go-to when I need extra color for an event. I would never go anywhere else!"
22680,2,"In theory I love Rose & Crown: Good people, good beer, good location, etc. \n\nBut sometimes they fail the service test, albeit unintentionally, due to staff and space challenges.\n\nWhen it's not packed and I can enjoy steady service from the pool room or out on the porch, life is just about perfect. However, if I'm jammed inside with 100 other people vying for the same bartender's attention, I kinda want to take my ball and go home.\n\nSo when you go to Rose & Crown, which I enthusiastically suggest you do, temper your expectations based on how busy it is. \n\nAll that said the food is dependable, the beer selection is legit, and it's an ideal place to check out a weekend soccer match or even Sunday NFL football."
3431,3,"Went here once for labwork.  My wife had something down the street to tend to.  No one was there, and it was only me that Friday morning.  I was in and out in 7 minutes.  Too bad this place is now closed :-(!!!"
15599,3,"Went here quite awhile ago with my uncle... he stays at Harrah's properties regularly, and on this trip he was at the Flamingo.  I think they comped him dinner at the steakhouse.  It was actually well above average for a steakhouse, from memory.  Alas, I just heard today that it is not closed.  Not surprised as there's a million places to get a good steak in this town."
11102,1,"Once again the Mexican restaurant in Stations casinos has changed hands. No longer Guadalajara, but Cabo now.\n\nMy fiance and I decided to stop in here late on Friday night after I got off work. I really wanted a margarita to celebrate the completion of my training. \n\nWe waited... A lot. We waited for the hostess to show up. We waited for chips. We waited for drinks... Lots of waiting.... I waited for a water I ordered that never came. So I drank my fiance's. We were never asked if we wanted a refill of our chip basket.\n\nThe poor girl serving us seemed frazzled. The busboy was of very little help.\n\nThe food was mediocre. My margarita was the star of the night. It was very good and blended well. They did honor the check-in policy and we got sopapillas, which we took to go.\n\nI don't know why Stations Casinos keep changing their restaurants... But this change was not for the better. The only thing I'd come back for is another raspberry margarita."
28315,3,Awesome huge slices of New York style pizza.  Perfect amound of sauce and cheese on a chewy & crisp crust.  Pizza came out hot and fresh!  Staff was happy and accommodating.  Bing bang for your buck!
25493,1,Seafood restaurants in montreal = a big nono\nThe setting of the restaurant was beautiful but not the quality of food\nOrdered the Louisana seafood and the flavour was absolutately terrible...no cajun flavour at all as it was very bland...the shrimps and scallop were big but they had no taste to it all it....i rather eat at a long john silvers than pay $34 for that entree\n\nsave your money and goto a different seafood restaurant
38359,4,"How many times can I rave about Ella? Not enough!! \nElla and her hubby work together photographing and video recording weddings all over the world! \nMy hubby and I were lucky enough to have 2 wedding ceremonies... Ella did one (the big fancy one) and her company high class studios (photographers that work for her) did the small.  Both were amazing, everyone was there on time, super nice, and had great and creative ideas.  \nShe also does family shoots, newborn and everything in between!!"
22170,4,"This is hands down the best Cirque show ever. The acrobatics, costumes, stage, props, set, and lighting are incredible. Unlike other Cirque shows, this one has a clear theme that it adheres to, making every minute of the 1.5+ hour show worthwhile. \n\nYou have to see this if you are in Vegas!"
23466,0,"Goodness. I am sooo sorry to give this place 1-star. I mean, if you're gonna come here to wash the dog yourself and just need the space and materials, OK. But do not come here to get your dog \""professionally\"" groomed. I usually go to Best in Show, but since they were closed I gave this place a shot, and now my dog has the WORST hair cut.\n\nLuckily, she's still a cuite patootie.\n\nFirst of all, my dog is a pomeranian and poms do not need clippers involved. The woman meant well but she was clearly in over-her-head. You do not shave a pomeranian who is supposed to have long hair. They've got two layers and need to be hand cut. This is why I go to a pro. If i wanted to just give my dog a shave and call it a day, I would have. She wanted to show me what she was gonna do and SHAVED my dog's head right on the spot. She will say I OK'ed it, but I totally did not and she kept offering this easy shave method... URGH. \n\nMy biggest regret is not sticking to my gut. Now my dog, that took nearly a year to grow out her cutie-patootie hair has to start from scratch. To make things worse, we expected a bad haircut and felt defeated, and when we went back in, it was THE WORST hairdo my dog has ever had. In all the west coast. \n\nThe groomer is a sweet lady, but she does not know anything about dog upkeep, my dog's butthole wasn't even cleaned and shaved around as ALL OTHER places do. DO NOT COME HERE for professional service you will be disappointed."
49289,2,"Jeff and I were excited to give this place a try after hearing it had re-opened. We loved their beef tacos and menudo prior to the temporry closing. We had just finished hiking at Piestwea and were both very hungry. Jeff and I both loved the lengua tacos. They were juicy and with plenty of meat. The cabeza tacos had good flavor but were a little dry and bit too greasy. I didn't like the pastor tacos and neither did Jeff. They were unusually sweet for my liking and I didn't care for the texture of the meat. Finally, I ordered a large menudo and loved everything about this delicious red stew, except for the fact that it was a bit too greasy this time. I've had plenty of menudo and I know there are ways to take some of the fat out so it's not so heavy. The tortillas served on the side were very good. The service was good and speedy but they weren't busy either. We def don't think it's as good as before, but, considering how hard it is to find good authentic Mexican food in Az, I give the new Atoyac a slightly above average rating."
33669,4,The new group seems to listening to the customers and they are on it. They took care of me and my needs without the feeling of someone trying anything over me. They explained the details before the work and  the mechanic even double checked to make sure everything is accurate. WOW!! I'm very satisfied. Definitely a great friendly group of guys and it's a big improvement from the previous experience. Awesome Job Steven and your team!! You will see more of my business for sure!\nThank you!!!
25063,2,"Service is good overall. The have happy hour all day. The food is not healthy, but treats great! The Blue Ribbon burger is delicious. My bf liked his colossus burger. The fries are decent,  but love that they have a range of dipping choices for them."
17552,3,"I came here as I was stuck at MGM until my flight. It's strategically located across from the KA theater. It must be really busy around show time.\n\nI came around 3pm and the restaurant was busier than most. I was surprised!\n\nI ordered the BLT, which was delicious. I'm a really big fan of maple glazed bacon, so I had to try the maple glazed pork belly, and I am so glad that I did. The maple glazed pork belly was AMAZING in terms of flavor. The pork belly itself wasn't melt-in-your-mouth orgasmic tasting but it definitely met expectations. I also like how they mashed up the avocados so it was more like an avocado spread rather than slices. It helps spread the avocados into each bite!\n\nI'd come back for the BLT."
31183,1,"I really like the food a lot and eaten or carried out food for the past few years. The reason I only give two stars is because hey constantly screw up my carry out order. I had a stretch of like two months in which there was something incorrect  in every carry out both at must have been a record of sorts. Tonight, once had my order messed up I ordered two burritos with no cheese. Guess what? There was cheese, cheese and more cheese. How is it possible that a small restaurant can screw up so frequently. I have no idea."
29262,3,"Good overall quality, a nice selection, and they deliver to my office. I tried the crab puffs and the sampler platter for my last order. The egg drop soup is especially good with a side of crispy noodles. You can order via Grub-hub."
15757,0,"This is my 2nd time at Udupi Cafe, and I waited to write a review until a 2nd visit to be sure. The service here is lackluster, our waiter actually told us that \""he only works here\"" and has no input into the chefs cooking when we asked him if we could not have all the vegetables in the mixed pakora platter. seriously? \n\nThe food is mediocre, the pakoras are dry and tasteless, we had chile pakoras and there was no spice or creativity to them.\n\nThe dosa itself is good, the potatoes are very mushy and have minimal taste and their chutneys are not the best quality. \n\nI would recommend spending more time on working on their food  preparation and less time on the wait staff telling us that nothing can be changed. As a 100% indian, i would recommend Jewel of the Crown over this cafe in an instant."
35677,1,"I checked in at the Rumor after having to cancel a reservation at another local resort due to no parking and a lot of other problems.\n\nCheck in was ok but a bit confusing and two different rates were quoted before the lesser one was approved.  I was told in a harsh tone that they were giving me a discount off their regular rate.  According to the staff on duty they do not take AARP, AAA or any other discount.\n\nFinding and moving into the room was okay.\n\nThe good points:\n1. I like the rainfall shower and bathroom area.\n2. D\u00e9cor in the bedroom was nice with softer lighting.\n3. The bedroom had a large TV, but the one in the main living room area was extremely small.\n4. Air conditioning and heat were quiet.\n5. The resort fee, daily charge, provides you with free internet and two bottles of water.  The pool was the only other \""resort\"" item I observed and it was too cold to swim when visiting the LV area.\n6. The large white leather sofa was a nice touch but other comfortable chairs were missing.\n\nThe bad points:\n1. Upon checking the beds the sheets on one had what appeared to be fecal stains. Upon removing them to take the front desk, the mattress pad had short black, like pubic hairs, on it.  Both items were removed and taken to the front desk.  They had new sheets and mattress pad delivered to the room.  We had to make up the bed. ( They did discount the room an additional $20 dollars)\n2. Only 1/2 roll of toilet paper was in the room.  Had to have more delivered.\n3. The small TV in the living room area was inadequate for the space.\n4. I understand the boutique idea.  However the dark gray walls were depressing and made the room dark even with the drapery open.\n5. Large stains on the carpet in several areas.  You could not tell what the stains might have been.\n6. The curtains had several holes in them that were very easy to see; especially with the light from outside.\n7. Parking was close to the room but very dark at night.\n8. I had to call the front desk to find out were ice machines were located.  The one they directed me too was broken.  I had to search three other buildings to find an ice machine.  The machines are not convenient to most rooms.\n9. Very limited on site food service.\n10. There are few electrical outlets in the room we had and plugs would not stay in the outlets when plugged in.\n11. The air conditioning and heater was located beside one of the beds.  This unit blew air right on the bed all night and it was uncomfortable to sleep in due to the air flow.\n12. I requested a late check out and was told it would be an additional $25 for 1 hour, or $40 for a 3 hour extended checkout. (What a joke it was Sunday morning and I had already been told they had very few reservations for Sunday night.) \n\nI realize that rates vary in Las Vegas but this facility seems to be over priced for the services and staff support that a guest receives.  I would have to think seriously if I wished to return."
20652,4,"Every single time we fly to Vegas, we always make sure we make a stop at Lee's for our party rock liquor! lol!\n\nI swear this is the biggest liquor store i have ever stepped in & they even have tasters too!\n\nI always end up buying more bottles than I should (not necessarily a \""bad\"" thing if you are planning to party in Sin City..hehe) because I always want to try something new since they have so many bottles I haven't even seen (or tasted!) before. *^_^*\n\nAmong their selections they have giant bottles of Grey goose and the largest variety of mini bottles to purchase."
15639,1,"While the scone was delicious the coffee was to be desired and as cool as the place seems you have to know someone behind the counter to get good service.  They had forgotten to make our sandwiches, did apologize and gave us 1 free drink card hmm seems like they could have done better. I don't believe ill be back again too bad some places live by reputation rather than quality!"
38948,2,"Par to sub par for a AYCE sushi bar. \nNice atmosphere, decorating, lighting, outside seating, and open till 3am, are some of the selling points, but their fish pieces are small, sushi rice was borderline and their sashimi salad was a sad excuse. \nUnlike other AYCE, their soft shell crab is not included in the $27 price tag. \nTheir one redeeming item was their \""pork belly\"". Pretty incredible, actually. Ive never seen this item at other sushi bars, but after eating their sushi i understand why they added it to the menu....\nI suspect it's their only reason for success."
11224,4,"We recently took our 5 month old boxer Phoebe to Dr. C because she had been hit by a car and her femur was broken.  We weren't sure she was going to survive, let alone walk again.  We took her to them, they were open on Sunday, which was totally great.  They kept her for a few days until we could decide what to do for her.  Dr. C said he would be able to operate on her leg and we went ahead with the surgery.  They kept her for a few weeks after her surgery, to ensure the best possible outcome for recovery.  We were super happy about it because we have a two boys at home (a 2yr and a 4yr old) that would be hard to explain to them why they can't play with her and why she can't get out of her crate.\n\nPhoebe was released to us just before Christmas and she is doing great.  Her leg is healing and a pin was placed in her leg to stabilize it.  In a couple more weeks she will have the pin removed and then she will be on the road back to normal.  So far she is doing great at home.  She still needs to be confined, but she is putting weight on her leg and she is antsy to move around and play.  \n\nWe know she will make a full recovery and for that we are truly indebted to Dr. C, Dr. Beckus and Dr. Mizrahi (I'm hoping I spelled their names correctly) and the entire staff at Park Animal Hospital.  They know what they are doing and they care about animals.\n\nThank you!!"
12311,2,"Christmas in Vegas is quite different and one thing that I noticed was lots and lots of people were doing the same as well!! \n\nI thought the room was alright and the bathroom as quite nice what I didn't like was how slow service was. I mean I guess I should give them a little bit of slack since it was during the Christmas time. \n\nThis place had one thing that made it very pretty: The nice little decorations of polar bears which was made with flowers and all the decorations for Christmas. \n\nI had a good time here, but it just wasn't what everyone makes it out to be. It wasn't that crazy of a place...but it was still a-ok for my trip."
41009,3,"I'm going to let the cat out of the bag, The Black Cat is a good pub on Rose Street...\nRose Street (much like the Grassmarket) serves as a pub crawl magnet, where all the pubs are essentially generic, well The Black Cat isn't one of those places, for one it isn't suited to the stag/hen pub crawls simply due to the fact it's fairly small.\n\nAs this is a pub, lets get to the important part, Black Cat keeps a good lager (St Mungo), real ale (two rotating casks), Aspalls cider and a great selection of whisky alongside a choice of vodka, rum or gin. So a good selection of beverages (I don't drink wine so it will never appear in my reviews but it is available) for the more discerning palette...\n\nSo to sum up this is one black cat that isn't ill luck should your paths cross."
25504,3,"Great restaurant! I've never been disappointed. The food is consistently good, and the service is very professional."
47707,1,"First thing I am going to say is\"" I am so sorry Buddy! I love you, I love your show! I love your charisma, but unfortunately the food at your Las Vegas restaurant is very disappointing. ;( We came here on Dec. 24 to celebrate my daughters first birthday, this i will give you though, your staff is excellent! Great customer service and great ambiance! They were very accommodating and on top of things, Kudos on that! We ordered various things from desserts to appetizers, the most disappointing item was the veal, it tasted funky and it had a weird smell to it, so i returned it and they graciously took it off my bill. the tastiest item we ordered was the linguini with clams, but it wasn't amazing, the other items like calamari, osso buco, grilled cheese, was ok, but not great as well. The lobster tail dessert was just horrible, it was as hard as a rock! I am sorry to say that my expectations were a bit higher, especially since the menu was a bit pricey, but even if the menu was more reasonably priced, the taste was just not exciting my palate. I mean overall it was a fun time, I don't regret celebrating my baby's first birthday there, hey at least the baby loved the free bread sticks, but would I come back? Maybe if somebody else paid, i would be willing to give it another shot, also keep in mind that they just opened this location, and every restaurant will always have its growing pains, that's why these reviews are necessary."
6004,3,"One of my favorite places for Subs in Pittsburgh. Very cheap (less than $10) and the food is excellent. Can get crowded and loud, but that also means something right? It's probably because I stick with my standard, but I feel like something is missing...\nFor a quick bite or lunch, you certainly can get a satisfying meal here!"
1010,4,By far our favorite spot we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange - definitely new to the job - but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable. Very large beer selection as well. Highly recommend - we'll be back!!
34016,2,"Been here several times before just to hang out and watch football in the bar area. They have some nice furniture set up in front of a cute fireplace. I think I fell asleep a couple times here.\n\nThis last visit I came with my wifey on a Thursday night at 9:30. Im assuming the dining area closes at 9 because the door to that area was locked so we went into the bar which is 24/7. We sat ourselves at one of the tables and flagged down a server.\n\nFor some odd reason, this night I was craving corned beef and cabbage (preggo maybe? Lol), which is what brought us here. We live literally right across the street for about 3 years and we always talked about checking this place out for the food. Why is it that whenever you live right next to something, you always seem to drive right by it thinking you will go there someday since you live near it but more often than not, you never make it in there? Well I finally did but only took me 3 years.\n\nAnyways, since it was late and we didn't want to eat too much before going to bed later, we decided to order Loaded Potato Skins and Corned Beef n Cabbage. We planned on sharing but if you refer to my pic, the Loaded Potato Skins were a meal in itself. So we called one of friends to join us who just happened to be down the street.\n\nAs she showed up, Corned Beef n Cabbage came out. Again if you refer to my pic, its a decent amount of food. What actually stood out was the Pretzel Breadstick that came with it. This alone will make me come back. Even if you don't like anything at all here, just get the Pretzel Breadstick. I have never had anything like it and my wife agrees. We were very tempted to order some more but already had a lot of food to deal with. \n\nThe Loaded Potato Skins were actually not bad. Came with sour cream. As for the Corned Beef n Cabbage, I thought it was ok as well. Now mind you its been a long time since I have had this so there really wasn't anything I could compare it to. Came with some kind of cubed potatoes and the cabbage had bits of corned beef with peppercorns.\n\nThe ambiance of the place was nice in a creepy way. You have antique pictures of old people on the walls. Kind of reminds me of the eerie paintings they have at the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. I wonder if the dining room is set up the same way.\n\nService was below average. Once we got our food, I think our server went home because we didn't see her any more and the bartender was the only one that came around after a while to refill our drinks.\n\nOverall, I think the negatives cancel out the positives which equals the 3 star rating."
42663,0,"The food was seriously gross AND way overpriced. I am a pretty shitty cook, and I honest to god could have made better tacos. Plus, as we all know, a day of drinking can make somewhat questionable fare (Del Taco) taste like ambrosia of the gods - and yet, 10 beers deep, the food still tasted disgusting. Cold meat/no salsa on the tacos, wilted lettuce & canned corn on the salad, and to top it off a $60 check?? I think not, sir. Spend your money on \""manbuckets\"" of Coors Light at the flamingo pool ($48 for 12 beers, hayyyy)."
22092,1,"Hilariously in the sense that this is exactly what Vegas food consisted of in the late 80's and early 90's. Typical reheated, cafeteria-influenced eggs/sausage/bacon and standard sandwiches. The breakfast is notably poor, as the eggs will guaranteed be overcooked, the sausage rubbery and the biscuits cold. The sandwiches are decent, but very oily and the bread is soggy. I guess an advantage is the fact that it's open 24 hours, but why would you want bad food at all hours in this day and age? Go somewhere else unless you really are obligated to eat in this poorly-located, poorly-staffed countertop deli."
45250,0,"This one star is coming from a vegetarian bias. \n\nIF YOUR VEGETARIAN DO NOT GO HERE.\nCame here expecting  to try a veggie pho (didnt have it) and the server gave me a weird look ontop of it all. SO i ordered THE only vegetarian option they had (this was 4 months ago might have changed) and asked for noodles to come with it. The server said no problem. The dish came (no noodles) and he never came back for  me to mention it until i was all finished. It was whatever..nothing special..\n\nPlace prettty much blows, for non carnivores. If the service was great i would of elevated the stars...but nope..pretty poor"
25962,0,"By far the worst pizza I've ever ate (well we tried to eat some of it). It was so bad I gave the whole pizza to my dad who usually eats everything. Although he managed to garburate it, he himself told me it was one of the worst things he had ever eaten. The cheese felt like rubber, the sauce had an after taste, the dough was dry. On top of it all it was the most expensive pizza I've even bought.\n\nNever again!"
36227,4,Went to One Love Boutique through a Living Social special.  They offered a dermaplane and facial treatment for an unbelievable price.  I can honestly say that Lori P. did the best job out of all the facials I have had.  Such a relaxing atmosphere. She never tried to sell me on products. I have spent double the price and more at other facilities and none compared to my experience with Lori.  She gained a new client!!
13158,1,"Stayed here for my bachelorette party. I didn't pay for it so that probably helps a little bit with the rating.  I knew this wasn't going to be a great hotel or anything but I was still a little excited to stay there just because it's so random and funny to stay in a pyramid shaped hotel.  \n\nWell, the elevators are weird and not in a fun way.  For some reason, I thought they would be glass so you could see out.  Not the case.  They move upwards at a diagonal angle which is unsettling when you're sober and nausea inducing when you're drunk.  Our room was ok.  Nothing to write home about but no problems either.  The windows and slant of the room make it seem much smaller than it probably is.  \n\nCheck in was easy and quick.  Tacos N Tequila restaurant had good guacamole and a bachelor party there bought us Patron shots.  So that was good.  \n\nGambling was ok, again nothing exciting.  \n\nWe went out by the pool one afternoon.  It was so hot and there was no shade.  At a certain point in the afternoon, the glare coming off the pyramids was horrible.  Also, I don't need to look at a larger than life size poster of Carrot Top when I'm trying to relax.  \n\nOverall, it was ok but I don't think I would ever pay for their weekday prices or would be in a rush to stay there again."
31067,4,"I do 97% of my families shopping here. I love the bakery that this location has! Some of their prepared meals are better then others just like any store. The Indian ones are actually quite good for Indian on the go. The meat  and their cheese selection is always awesome. The staff at this store are great, they are always friendly and helpful."
26263,2,"I probably would have rated this higher had I not discovered Little Asia and Rose Tea cafe.  However, since I have, I would say this place is okay only.  The Chinese food is decent and it is probably better suited for big groups than Rose Tea or Little Asia.  However, the food is not as good as Rose Tea or Little Asia either.  The food can run on the bland side.  I only remember really liking their Spinach Soup with Thousand year old eggs.  They are interesting enough to serve dim sum any time you want but I have definitely had better dim sum.  Then again, I might be spoiled by the Bay Area dim sum scene :-D"
7892,0,"I've never had such terrible service.  When I spend more than $100 on dinner for two people, I expect the servers to at least be polite.  Went on a Friday night, but there was no hostess on duty.  After waiting a bit at the hostess stand, we gave up and walked into the dining area where we were pointed to a table.  This was an issue all night with people wandering through the crowded tables looking for somewhere to sit and standing over diners waiting for them to get up.  We placed our drink order (bottles of wine starting at $40), and then we waited.  And waited.  Finally someone walked by and put the bottle on our table - unopened - and kept walking.  10 minutes later a different server came by and asked if we wanted the bottle open (ummmm...yeah!).  While he was opening it, the first guy came by and started fussing at him because he \""was planning on coming back for it.\""  They walked off bickering - and without taking our order.  After 20 minutes, we considered just leaving money on the table for the wine and going someplace else.  It wasn't that the servers were too busy, the ratio of servers to tables looked fine.  And I could them wandering around at the bar not actually doing anything.  Everytime one walked past our table he turned his head and avoided eye contact.  Finally, we were able to wave someone down when he told us that we weren't really his table, but fine, he would take our order.  Scowling the entire time.  We got a calamari appetizer, a ceaser salad, chicken parmesan and chicken marsala.  The food was good.  But by the time we got it, we had finished our bottle of wine and weren't offered anyting else to drink.  Nobody came by to check to see if the food was ok.  So while the food and decor was good, I marked it down for being overpriced and terrible service.  I won't be going back."
45481,3,"My husband and I decided to go here at the last minute on a Friday evening when I didn't feel like cooking.  We made a reservation about an hour in advance and were seated immediately.  The decor is nice - I liked the colors, the textures, and the distressed brick.  It has an upscale gastropub feel.  There are long high top tables in the middle of the restaurant that looked like they held multiple parties of people, but we were seated in a booth.  The booths were very private, which we really liked.\n\nWe got there at the tail end of happy hour, so we ordered our drinks and appetizers immediately.  We had the pork belly taco and the duck fat fries.  Both were excellent, and honestly if I had just ordered two tacos and the fries to myself it would have been the perfect meal.  I'll definitely return for the taco.\n\nFor dinner my husband had slow-cooked beef shoulder and I had the bacon-wrapped pork filet mignon.  My husband's meal was better.  Mine was fine, but the whole dish was just a little too sweet for my liking.  After the smoky, meaty pork belly taco, I was wanting something similar in taste.  I would get something different next time.  We also had the bananas foster beignets for dessert.  They were soooo good!  \n\nAll in all, I will definitely return to the Salty Sow.  It wasn't the best meal I've ever had in Phoenix, but it was still excellent - from ambiance, to service, to food - and I can't wait to come back and sample some more of the menu."
15732,3,"I don't know why this place has low ratings, its good for a franchise restaurant, and way better than Olive Garden on sunset. Decent service and the food is always on point."
41339,2,"We ate there with the family, nice, cozy environment, it was kind of dead for a Sunday. At the entrance of the buffet it smelled like sewer, we were grossed out but wanted to give it a try. We eat sushi 15 times a month... no joke! This place is NOT grade A sushi at all.. you can compare it to Grocery store sushi... it was OK. \nThe variety of the buffet was really good, it would even be better if everything tasted good for that amount of money!"
21955,4,"Located in Planet Hollywood..a bit of a mission to find if you parked in their parking garage. \nA huge line of people waiting to get their sammich on. \n\nTheir limited time only special caught my eye and looked..BOMB!\n\nIt was Chipotle chicken with bacon and avocado. DROOOL. \n\nThey have two cashiers. One to take your order, and to hand you a buzzer, and as you keep going through the line, they have drinks, chips, parfaits, fruits, and desserts to your left to get if you want it. Then they have the main cashier for you to pay. \n\nA good amount of space, seats are kind of close together, but I mean, hey whatever haha. \n\nI got me the sandwich and salt & vinegar chips. Total was about $7 and some change. Pretty good! \n\nSat my ass down, and within 3 minutes, my buzzer was a buzzin' and I went to pick up my sammy. \n\nIt doesn't look big..but it fills you up well! It was soooo delicious. Toasty warm, and so flavorful. \n\nI hear they're making one in DT Disney!? :O :O :O"
38505,3,"I had the chance to eat from the Hey Joe truck today when all the food trucks were up in Scottsdale at the Whole Foods Market on Raintree. \n\nI had the \""Valley Dish\"" which was Pancit noodles, 2 lumpia,  and some rice. The dish was yummy... and it was a treat to have Fillipino food for lunch up in Scottsdale. The dish was $8 bucks. I think it was fair for the portion. \n\nI look forward to eating from the Hey Joe truck again when I can make it down to the Phoenix Market."
8082,4,"Tottie's is a family owned restaurant where customer service prevails. The food is mouth watering to look at and painfully delicious to eat. \n\nPainful? WHA- The problem is how much you'll want to eat.\n\nMy friend and I stopped in for a late afternoon bite. We had just missed the lunch specials (but that's ok! more to take home) and settled into our luxurious booth. The restaurant offers a variety of seating, ranging from tables to booths to the bar. All look equally appealing. (And can readily accommodate groups.)\n\nMichael charmed us with the joy and eagerness he exuded. After ordering Pad Thai and Panang Curry he generously offered us soup leftover from lunch. (And our rubber arms quickly said yes!) \n\nSOUP\nWhy does this have it's own category? The egg drop soup and sweet and sour are *only* served during lunch hours. (11am - 2pm). If you're lucky some might be leftover and Michael might be around to share. You should try those two soups. And here's a trick. Try those two soups mixed together.\n\nHoy My Goodness.\nThe sweet and sour is a powerfully strong soup offering a kick of spice. The egg drop soup is rich (and has mushrooms, which work quite well) and creamy in a different way. Together? You've got to try it. I highly recommend it. \n\nHAPPY HOUR\nRuns Tuesday thru Friday, 5pm - 7pm. Food and drink specials abound. Sushi rolls are discounted and they offer things like Sake Bombers, Mimosas, a Riesling and a red blend for $5. (Some other wines for $4. Budlight for $2.50.) \n\nFOOD\nThe Pad Thai delivers on all levels. If you really want it fire engine hot they will provide additional spices. The Panang Curry kicks butt. Spicy means enough to clear your sinuses but not make you cry. The dinner portions are ginormous. You could readily share a meal...but then there'd be no leftovers!\n\nI'd definitely throw in a Thai Tea if you've never had one. It's almost smoky in taste (yet sweet) and goes down too quickly.\n\nSERVICE\nI don't know how he did it, Michael must have eyes in the back of his head or something, but my Diet Pepsi was never empty. I slurped down three that I can remember. And he even offered to provide one to go!\n\nThis place rocks!\n\np.s. there's another location in northern scottsdale."

23226,3,"One thing my boyfriend and I like to do during the hot days of summer is to relax and read a good book while sipping an iced coffee at a local coffeehouse.  This week we went to Solo Cafe.  We were kind of hungry so we thought maybe we could get a sandwich there.  Unfortunately, they do not have a kitchen and the only food they serve are pastries at this time.  Luckily Solo is in a strip mall with food options.  We left and came back.  I had an Iced Cafe Latte and my boyfriend had a Iced Cafe Mocha.  Both very good drinks.  Also, the barista was very nice and seem really laidback and cool.  Another plus is that they have free wi-fi.  Important for me because I was doing catching up on some work while my boyfriend read his book.  This is definitely a place we will go back to."
4065,1,Chairs are uncomfortable... The only time they act like they understand  or speak English is when your talking about price & times up for massage.  I liked the cucumber scrub & didn't have to wait long.  Not a bad place to go if in the area but I've been to a lot better.
40396,1,I just don't get it.  The pizza is nothing better than average.  Anyone from NY will tell you it takes much more than a thin crust to make an NY pizza.  The service was very good and the Caesar salad was fantastic.  My quest for good pizza in Las Vegas continues.
48454,4,"Skoti was awesome!! He kept his word, was very punctual, and treated a group of 11 of us like we were V.I.P's. I would recommend him/his company to anyone going to Vegas who's trying to enjoy the REAL Vegas experience! Definitely calling him on my next trip!"
47266,4,"This just became my favorite ice cream spot in town. Found in the same plaza as Viva Las Arepas, this is the perfect after meal dessert to satisfy your sweet tooth. The owners were super friendly and are quick to offer you the flavors of the day to sample. The gelato flavors are often creative and innovative. One of my favorites was the baklava, which has since disappeared from the regular lineup. It's a nice little spot if you want to get away from the bustle of the Strip and Downtown."
28086,1,"Really? I was not impressed.  I came here with industry friends as part of the Botero Supper Club before heading out to XS.\n\nThe restaurant decor is trendy and fashionable.  I was optimistic about the food, but it just did not deliver.  This may be because we were ordering off the Supper Club menu, but it just wan't very good.  We dined tapas style with french fries and homemade ketchup, pork belly sliders, kobe beef sliders, and other forgettable dishes.  None of the dishes were bad, but then again none of them were really good either.\n\nI wouldn't do it again.  It was a comped dinner and I still wouldn't do it again.  I can't speak for a full dinning experience here, but the Botero Supper Club is a sad experience and I would discourage someone from doing it."
22592,3,"Finally, a place that advertises Spanish sausage and doesn't hand me a Mexican chorizo. I enjoyed a very nice lunch sitting on the back patio the other day. I ordered the cheese and sausage panini. The service was very friendly and I left much happier than when I arrived."
9963,3,"Again, one of my favorite meals in vegas.  We had to wait about 40 minutes for a table for two on friday night to get a seat, which is to be expected.  We got about 7 tapas for the two of us.  As many others have stated, get the bacon wrapped stuffed dates, they are very good.  I've been here before and I think I liked the food this time around better.  The other thing with tapas places, I've felt that I'm not getting value for my money typically, but this was $62 including tip for two, and 7 plates and 1 dessert, no drinks (just water).  I thought this was pretty good.  As far as service, it was ok.  I am picky about making sure my drinks are refilled consistently.  I waited a while the first time, and then just asked the server to leave a pitcher of water, so I really didn't have to wait the rest of the meal. Overall, I would recommend checking this place out."
15705,4,"I've been a member at Planet Fitness since April and I love it. It's small so you see the same people there everytime you go if you have a consistent schedule, and there are very few meatheads grunting and trying to impress everyone with how much they can lift. The staff is super friendly and always willing to help people out by showing them how to use a specific machine...although I'm not sure why people need a tutorial on how to use an elliptical or treadmill, but that is just me.\n\nI pay $15/month and it is automatically debited from my account mid-month. There is nothing fancy about this gym...just cardio machines with a box that you can plug your headphones into so you can get the sound from whichever TV you select, free weights, and weight machines. No pool, sauna, classes, etc. It's just a gym which is all I need and want.\n\nEven when it's \""crowded\"", there is never a wait for machines or cardio equipment. Weekend mornings are pretty quiet, as are the days near the holidays. I've also noticed it's less crowded when ASU is not in session. All and all, a great place to workout especially since it within walking distance of my apartment."
20358,4,"We were idiots and didn't rent a car at the airport and after calling around this was the closest place in Downtown with the best prices. But then I checked Yelp and got pretty scared but alas our reservation was already booked so what's a girl to do? Well, I went ahead and checked it out for myself and I was very happy with my experience I felt a more recent review needed to be written on here. The small desk sits in the Golden Nugget hotel and it's very easy to miss but just ask someone and they can tell you where it's at. The clerk was so helpful and even helped me avoid the airport return fee by having us sign up for roadside assistance thus saving us $7, hey that's half a cocktail on the Strip right? Anyway, check out was easy and fast. The car we received was clean and the employee who did our inspection was very thorough. Since this was our first time renting a car, ever, the front desk clerk really helped us understand how it all worked and I felt I in good hands. If you can remember to rent a car at the airport it's usually cheaper but this was a great alternative and not much higher in price."
8731,0,"We were out at the lake this weekend boating and towed a jet ski rented from Jet Action back to the dock.  Things happen, but when I called the office to help make arrangements for the couple \""stuck\"" in the middle of the lake, I was treated rudely and told that \""these things don't break down so I don't know what to tell you.\""  No suggestions or assistance was offered. I would NOT rent here.  Unhelpful and very rude."
24571,1,"Disillusioned.\n\nThe food while good, but tried to do too much with the palate.  I had the Monte Cristo and while I applaud the use of brioche to make a turkey sandwich...I really wish they wouldn't have drizzled the syrup all over it.  At that point either make it an open-faced item or keep the drizzle so it can be eating without sticky fingers.\n\nThe ambiance was pretty nice, I did enjoy the decor.  The service was a little overflowing in the repressed attitude department.  We all have bad days or rough patches...but seriously...when your body language clearly establish we're not worth your time it REALLY detracts from the eating experience.  In general, I find it really uneasy when the waiter (or waitress) roll their eyes if the entire party chooses to drink water ... newsflash it's just being healthy and not necessarily cheap...so don't act like \""there goes your tip.\""\n\nI probably wouldn't go back unless it was with a group of friends that were fans of the place.  If I did go back, it would give me a chance to taste something different, but I would rather spend my money elsewhere.\n\nMaybe it'll be better next time."
47220,4,"Stopped in to find a specific herb for my sis.  Whole foods was the only ones that carried fenugreeek and thankfully, we were in that area.  Found someone to help us straight away, as the vitamin and supplement area is extensive, but had to push through a line of people waiting to see Fabio, who was scheduled to make an appearance for his new drink mix. \n\nIt was horrible of me but I giggled my way out of the store, asking my mom if she was sure that she didn't want to stay for Fabio. \n\nWhole foods is a little high priced but consistent and trustworthy."
15115,3,"I really love the beef noodle soup here. The soup base is very tasty with red peppers in it. I had to pick out all of the red peppers because my lips were burning and mouth was on fire from every single bite. \n\nWhat I didn't like was that we didn't even order tea, but they brought it for the table and charged each person for a cup. The sad part was that not everyone even touched their tea cups. What an easy way to make money huh?\n\nOverall, I was impressed with the beef noodle soup. I usually don't eat a lot, but I was able to finish the whole bowl. I feel like the portion was too small because it is really expensive for a bowl of noodles. Oh well, everything is expensive on the strip I feel. \n\nCraving the noodles right now... =("

26256,3,"I read all the reviews after my girlfriends decided to drag me out to see a Band last night. The place was not packed so parking wasn't an issue (we got there around  8:30pm but it was Good Friday after all). \n\nNo meat so we he had the veggie platter with hummus, coconut shrimp with spicy orange dipping sauce, fried calamari with an asian chili type sauce, crab meat stuffed mushrooms. \n\nI have to say the food was excellent! Portions split amongst us were perfect, this is not your typical bar food. In fact, if you've ever been to Bonfire in Monroe while its a lot bigger - the food here at Finz is head and shoulders above them, and I know my food at every level :)  Bonfire I'd pass on sorry. \n\nBathrooms are very clean, the bar itself and tables are as well, and the Waitress we had was a sweetheart! Loved her, very attentive. The prices were perfect! Nothing broke the bank, which is why we were able to get a bunch of appetizers and sample a nice variety of picky foods! Great menu!\n\nSaw kids leaving around 9pm with parents so there are high tables to eat at. I know you can book parties there, they apparently have two tonight per the waitress. I'd absolutely consider it for a party esp. with bands like Smiling Dogs or SugarSmax. \n\nAll in All, if you want a nice night out with friends, able to see and hear a band from anywhere in the bar (by the way they were not so loud that you left with a headache like Skinnyz). Apparently they have an outdoors area that we will definitely be back this summer to try out. LOVED the band, hope to see another tonight, you can't beat free as in no cover charge (please don't change that!) and close to home. \n\nI think we'll try the burgers tonight to see how other items on the menu are but kudos to the chef there. The salads that walked by looked awesome too. \n\n*Note: we wanted the Caprese Skewers but they were out of Mootz :( and I saw someone walk by with a pizza that looked just a littttttle too dark, but still give them four stars, we are fans and will be back. \n\nYou have a winning mix there, don't change anything!"

17611,4,"Well... to sum it all up, I will tell you a short story.  My husband and our families went to the FQ Story Home Tour a short while back.  In one of the beautiful homes on the tour we were bombarded with lots and lots of artwork depicting naked men.  Lots of highly detailed sculpted peen to go around.  The owner of that home very clearly got his stuff from EXPOSED.  I guess that isn't surprising considering the name of this fun and eclectic gallery.\n\nWe stopped in one day simply because we were in the area shopping for vintage.  We weren't looking for anything to buy at all, we just wanted to look.  As soon as we walked in our eyes were met with a kaleidoscope of colors in the form of sculpted glass.  You will find lots and lots of that here.  You will also find lots of naked men things.  They even sell penis shaped stones at the counter you pay at! HA!  I'm immature, I know.  Anyway, there are also some incredible sculptures, including one that gets displayed out front, that are made of common tools.  Very creative and beautiful.  If I had the money, I would buy the phoenix/angel looking one out front.  \n\nThe owner of the store is super friendly and helpful.  He asked why were in there and listened to us explain that we wanted local or recycled or hopefully both.  After walking us around and showing us particular pieces, he let us be.  I found these beautiful glass wall pocket things along one of the walls.  They are small pieces of glass with a little pocket formed on the front.  It's large enough to put a single flower in there.  \n\nI really like this place.  Lots of fun an interesting stuff to look at.  The prices are also surprisingly low, especially considering the arm and a leg that some \""artists\"" feel they are entitled to charge."
26575,1,"At least the atmosphere is fun, because the food stinks!  The only reason I'm giving two stars is the delicious iced green tea.  I ordered a pasta with lemon butter, artichokes, spinach, broccoli, and fresh garlic, but as far as I could tell, the lemon butter was supposed to make up for the lack of vegetables.  Please give me more than six leaves of spinach and five small broccolis for a whole plate of pasta!  Norm P.'s food was even worse.  It was swimming in sauce to the point of being disgusting and he couldn't even finish it.  All in all, come for the drinks but not for the food.  I could make this same meal at home for less than a dollar, and it would taste much better."
6718,3,"Very nice, updated bed and breakfast. Furnishings and architectural details true to contextual history of building. Updated bathroom fixtures, quaint, lovely! I agree with most of the reviews written here. The noise from the pub can still be heard on 3rd floor. (Thankfully,, I had the 3rd floor room.) Street noise from morning rush hour traffic is discernible as well. Big deal if you're a light sleeper. Yes, the wi fi connection is not the greatest at this venue, SSID signal seems to fade in and out. Overall, a pleasant inn."
1438,3,"I really dig the rhythm room! I went to a concert here on Monday night. \n\nit was cute.\nit was quaint.\nit was CLEAN.\ngreat bartenders, love the option to sit or to stand. \n\nthe sound guy was a bit off and im pretty sure my ear is still ringing from the high pitched squeel when the microphones got too close to the speaker or something. but hey, it happens i guess. \n\ni had a blast at this sweet little spot."

16469,0,"I DONT love this bar and grill. The atmosphere is very impersonal. They call parties that are waiting to be seated over a microphone like you are at a car dealership. So once you are seated, you keep getting jolted by the loud \""party of 4!\"" Screams. \nThe service was very slow. We were seated before another couple yet, somehow their food arrived before us and they had steak and we didn't. The food was decent, not bad, definitely not worth waiting for and nothing to rave about. Not worth the price of the food or the wait. There are so many other options in vegas to choose from. \nAlso, as a side note, my aunt has been to the other TLBG location and said what a disappointment this one is compared to the great food and service at one in California."
35702,0,"I read the review that Steven E. wrote only minutes ago and quite frankly I am so embarrassed by the filthy conditions of this eatery. As you know, the Japanese take extreme  pride in cleanliness and neatness. This restaurant  is a disgrace to the Japanese culture and community at large. I have not eaten there nor will I unless they clean up their act! The owner, if he is Japanese, should consider hari kari. I hope he hasn't damaged our reputation too badly! My suggestion is to close down for a couple days and scrub, clean and polish from top to bottom and keep it that way! My apologies  to the loyal patrons for this sacrilege."
25469,3,"so its taste mtl week and i was looking for new places to try. places that had decently good reviews so this one caught my eye.\n\nRSVP is extremely easy with open table and a call back the morning of your reservation to confirm. easy as pie!\n\nbeautiful downstairs dining room with a bar overlooking the kitchen where you can enjoy watching cooks preparing the apps (and drool over some of them) or peak in the kitchen. there's a dining room upstairs too but i have no idea what it looks like.\n\nservice is attentive, waiters are extremely friendly and helpful. it wasn't rushed. after finishing my main, they didn't bring dessert out until i was ready which was like 10-12 minutes later.\n\nas for appetizer, i got the ostrich neck terrine with a foie gras surprise alongside some fresh greens, chopped chestnut, caramelized onions with slices of toasted baguette. it was definitely good with the many notes of flavor. it made me want more of it.\n\nfor main, it was the roasted salmon over a bed of cabbage, dulse gremolata and hareng-cini. the salmon was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and incredibly moist. 30-45 seconds less and it could be considered raw. the hareng-cini was crispy but lacked that something.\n\nand to finish it off, a chocolate caramel fleur de sel tart with confit butternut squash and pumpkin seeds (if i remember correctly). loved the squash and its accompanying sauce. enjoyed the caramel kick to the tart. as for the chocolate part, good but not rich enough.\n\nto accompany my main, i got their suggested wine that paired perfectly with the salmon.\n\nprice wise, with the glass of wine and after factoring in tips, you're looking in the neighborhood of $65. that's for their taste mtl menu. outside of that, expect to pay more.\n\nall in all, it was definitely good food that is perfectly cooked/prepared but it was missing that something. that je ne sais quoi that would definitely make you want to come back. i didn't get that feeling. instead, it was more of a \""i may consider this place if out with a bunch of friends looking for some french cuisine\""\n\nps. by sitting at the bar, i got a good look of the mackerel app with squid ink. it looks and sounds even better than the ostrich app"
2678,1,The prices are great but the wait is CRAZY just for picking up birth control that I called in on Monday it has taken me more than an hour. I finally got called but they can't find my pills I ordered four days ago.. Now I'm still waiting and I'll be surprised if they actually do anything for me. I should have known.. The first time I came here for my initial visit it took two hours with an appointment.. That's only 30 minutes of actually being in the back getting checked up and an hour and a half of wIt time! :( the only person that could finally help me was Adrianna! Thank you!
20664,3,"A couple doors down from Ichiza, this place is a cool little Korean pastry shop to buy pastries, eat a pastry there, chill with a cup of coffee, or talk with friends. There isn't a great abundance of seating, but I've never had trouble finding room. \n\nThey sell fresh pastries, wedding cakes, and also cake confections like tiramisu. \n\nI've had their mochi bread (bun with azuki bean mochi inside; $3), yummy. Their fried mochi is good, too. But the thing to write home about is the Mammoth bread. It's A huge flat pastry with azuki bean and butter cream inside ($15). Feeds me for a week and a half."

Figured Aloha Specialties at The Cal would be too crowded on a Saturday afternoon, so we decided to come here. How things have changed!\n\nWe walked in and were not greeted by the staff like before. Instead, there was a sign that said \""Counter service only. Please place your order with the cashier.\"" We asked the cashier, \""What happened to all the waiters?\"" She said that they \""changed the concept\"" of this Island Sushi a little over a year ago, hence the addition of the word Express. They have counter service only, but full service at the sushi bar. No waiters, no bartenders, which was kind of sad. We ordered our favorite - fried noodles, got a number, sat down at a table and our food was brought out to us 10 minutes later. Utensils, napkins, condiments and water were all self-serve. Although the food was still delicious, I believe the portions were a bit smaller. \n\nAgain, pretty sad. I miss the old atmosphere and how it used to remind me of home.

22768,2,"I dined here on a recent trip to Vegas.\n\nI had the Kobe beef sliders.  They were ok, but not worth the $13 I paid for them.  (Side note:  My friend almost got sick from eating them because they were too rich for her liking.)  I also had their Shichimi fries.  Those were good - nice & spicy.  Also had some Yukon Gold mashers, and those were good too.\n\nThey poured decent cocktails.  \n\nI would probably go here again next time I go to Vegas if I am hungry and in the area."
26756,4,"DAAAYUM!!! The previous reviews of this restaurant were very good and I set out to try it before...but it was closed. I forgot about it for a few weeks and decided to give it another shot this afternoon for lunch. I am so glad that I remembered this place!\n\nI am not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. The place is in the back corner of a little strip shopping center which was otherwise non-descript and I would probably have driven past unless I was specifically looking for something. As I approached I saw a nice size patio with outdoor seating. It was a nice day and I was tempted, but I went inside. The dining area was very spacious containing several tables without being overcrowded. Another thing that stood out was the smell. It smelled really good and it further increased my hunger.\n\nThe table was big, which is a good characteristic for me. I don't know how many places I go and they stick the big dude at the little table. I also thought the menu was cool. Nice thin wooden cover with an expansive listing of sandwiches, entrees, beers and wines. I would love to go back for the wine dinner, but being lunch I just ordered a sandwich. Another nice touch was the silverware. The waitress brought the silverware to the table in a mason jar. It is something different and really makes the place cool. Great atmosphere.\n\nMy friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich - which I don't care for chicken salad, but I did have a taste and it was good. Chicken, apples, nuts - very hardy. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was piled high. Good solid bread, thick meat and an incredible taste.  I had the potato salad side and my friend had the pasta salad. One thing I liked about both salads and the chicken salad also was the focus on flavor and ingredients. These items were not loaded down with mayo like so many other places. Instead, this restaurant let the main ingredients do the talking - the chicken salad made the chicken the focus item, followed by the apple and nuts. No heavy mayonnaise. Same with the potato salad - you tasted the Yukon yellow gold potatoes. The bread & butter pickles as a garnish took me back to my youth. My grandmother in Southern Ohio canned bread & butter pickles annually. Yum.\n\nI had to go for dessert, but I went with something small. I went with the lemon bar - sweet, tart and tasty. I wouldn't go specifically for the lemon bar as I might with something like Oregano's cookie, but this was a good finish to the meal. The sandwiches were both $8.50 (and well worth it), the lemon bar was an economical $2. Another cool & funky aspect of dinner was the smashed bottle serving plate. I like quirky little touches like that which help make the experience unique and memorable.\n\nReally the only thing that might be a fraction of a reduction for me was that it was a little loud and made it challenging to hear the conversation and the soda was a standard 20 oz bottle rather than a fountain drink. Small things and not really distracting from the overall excellent experience. I will definitely be back to this place many times. If you are in or around the area, stop by and make sure to give this place a try!"
44016,0,Terrible! Absolutely terrible! I know good sushi and this was not anywhere close. \n\nI don't usually write reviews but this was so bad I felt compelled to warn everyone. I went to this place because I had a groupon but I honestly wouldn't go back if the food was free.\n\nYou have been warned.
42526,0,"I am SO disappointed in this store.  We went there 2 years ago and bought a Seally Posturpedic.  The bed was great at first, but the mattress has deep indentations now from where we sleep.  We contacted Mattress Firm and they had us come in and fill out paperwork that they then faxed in to their warranty department.  I was told that I should be getting a call back sometime in the next 2-4 weeks.  After 4 weeks, no call back.  I called my local store up and they said the guy I filled the paperwork with had been transferred to another store.  For some reason, I had to track that guy down because they never keep copies of the paperwork so the rest of the people at my local store where I filled the paperwork out at have no idea what had been done with me.  Anyway, I tracked the guy down and he called up the warranty department.  Turns out they never actually got the paperwork.  So I brought my copy of the paperwork back to my local store and had them fax it in...again.  They got a confirmation receipt that the pages were sent and received.  This guy tells me it should only be 3 days before I hear back and had no idea why I had waited a month to check up on it.  (SIGH!)  So 4 days go by and I still don't get a call from the warranty people.  I call up the warranty people myself since I'm tired of dealing with the local store.  They check up and discover that they did in fact get my paperwork, but that something went wrong when it faxed over (guessing it's a problem with my local store's fax machine) and the pages are illegible.  I asked why they didn't tell my local store that it didn't send properly so they could resend it.  Apparently, the warranty department receives faxes but they can't actually tell which store is sending in the fax, so they didn't know which store to contact to get the information resent.  Grrr.  I finally just scanned the paperwork from my home and e-mailed it, then called the warranty to make sure that they got it and that they could actually read it.  They did.  only it was on the weekend, so I have to wait 3 days from Monday before they call me back.  Somebody please shoot me now."
42767,3,"This shop, located in the Bellagio, is smaller then its counterpart located in Aria's.\nThe chocolate fountain is amazing to look at and take pictures of.\n\nThe line is confusing and there are people everyone in this very small shop with very limited seating inside.\n\nI was so excited to be ordering individual desserts for my friend's birthday that I failed to listen to the girl that was describing what I was pointing to. My taste buds heard \""Raspberry Macaroon\"" and the girl actually said \""Raspberry Macaroon with ROSE OIL\"".\n\nNeedless to say I did not like the mini that I purchased for myself but my friend's all enjoyed, with great enthusiasm their desserts."
824,3,"I've been here for shows many times through the years.  The venue is small, but it is cozy and has lots of charm.  I've seen stand up comedy, concerts, and other events here and for pretty much all of them I'd say there isn't a bad seat in the house.  \n\nSince it is small though, it tends to get crowded very quickly  - and in general there is not assigned seating for the shows - so definitely show up early (before doors open) to get the best seats, or to make sure you sit together if you are with a large group.   Parking is not the best, but If you don't mind a small walk parking in the neighborhood behind the theater is your best option."

31991,2,"This is a nice limited service hotel in Middleton, next to a gigantic health club.  It is easy to get to when you get off the highway.  There isn't much you can walk to from here, but i would assume most people have a car that are staying at the Hampton Inn.\n\nThe rooms are comfortably large.  \n\nThe bed i slept in, a true King, was just so-so.  The mattress was a bit too firm and the blanket was pretty cheap.  They need an upgrade there.  The tv was a flat screen, but it was on the smaller side for the size of the room.  I did like that the bathroom i had didn't have a useless bathtub and instead had a walk in shower.  There was also complimentary Wi-Fi that worked well.\n\nThey also have breakfast in the morning.  Standard fare for these hotels.  They had nasty bacon however.  I love bacon and the bacon they had wasn't worth touching.  But the coffee, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs and fruit was fine.\n\nI would stay there again if i had to, but not my first choice in Madison."
41685,0,"The concept was a great one, but the festival and the food trucks were no where close to prepared for the amount of people that showed up. Not sure if it was great marketing or groupon, but there were way too many people there or way too few of food trucks. \n\nIf this event happens again next year I would advise to either double or triple the amount of food trucks or cap the number of attendees. I would also advise of having this at a different venue or get new traffic control management. \n\nThis was our day in a nutshell. Waited 45 minutes to park. This was a little frustrating, but we were so excited it didn't seem that bad. Once we entered the event we noticed right away the lines for the food trucks were very long. We game planned to split up and get in two lines. Little did we know the lines were so slow. At one food truck there was a line to get tickets then go to another line (Epic Hotdogs). \n\nAlmost an hour and a half later we finally get some food. The hotdog was cold and obviously the ingredients had changed a little bit while we were in line. The had ran out of some ingredients and were improvising. So frustrating.\n\nNeedless to say we were able to hit only one more truck each, unfortunately we didn't go to this event to be separated. The next food truck the owner of the truck (gourmet frybreads) was extremely rude and obviously overwhelmed with the situation. We all left hungry and very let down. \n\nI haven't even talked about the cost of everything. I had no problem with the $5 parking and the $10 cover if things were the way I expected. Everything was way too expensive for the experience. The food was way overpriced. $4 for a half a hotdog. $6.50 for a frybread with beans? Really, now the food trucks are gouging us! $7 beer? Well if you wait at the tent for a beer it's $3. The $7 beer seemed like a better deal seeing i didn't have to wait 45 minutes. \n\nI hate to write reviews like this because I am just repeating what others are saying. If you decide to do this event next year I am sure you will make adjustments. It will have to be a lot for us to go back. Great concept but horrible execution."
22246,1,"My first visit to GB was at a happy hour (good value). I saw all the raves about the garlic fries here, so I tried the tapas and the garlic fries. The tapas was ok. The garlic fries were ok, if a bit soggy. Really, ravers about the garlic fries? Hmm. They were ok at best. That's just at the time of eating, never mind the aftermath. I totally love garlic, but these must've somehow had a powerful chemical reaction in me that caused really gross burps all night (the zombies and clowns weren't the only scary things at FrightDome that night!). Then when the garlicky farts started...ay carumba! Talk about gagsville! The next day, my husband called me Garlic Girl!  Maybe it was the combo of garlic fries with all the roasted garlic in the tapas. \n\nI'll give GB another go, especially at happy hour prices but will avoid all things garlicky. Or maybe I'll just go to Kona Grill or Cheesecake Factory instead. \n\nSummary: The service was good, the happy hour value was good. The food was meh."
45164,2,"For me Fat Tuesday was a novelty, and I was excited to try it. This place is located int he forum shop, and it was definitely small and a bit empty, which was good for me. I dont know how the heck people can down a half yard or even a full yard. My hats go off to those beasts! Because I was feeling a little queasy, (my stomach was being an asshole) I decided to just go with the pilsner 22oz for $11. I read that some Fat Tuesdays offer samples. When I asked for samples, the server told me that he usually only gives one sample, but for me he would allow me to have two samples. I did not feel special. Allowing me to get 2 samples is no big whoop. I decided on Mango and Rum. It was pretty good! The mango was very prominent in slushie. I must say, I was pretty full by the time I finished it. I did not feel a buzz at all. So much for the rum, eh? My friend got a peach bellini. Now that one was pretty dang good. Either way, i think Fat Tuesday is a nice place to stop by for a fruity, slushie, alcoholic drink on a nice, warm (or hot) day."
26566,3,"Let me start by saying, I rarely give out 5 stars, so my 4 star review means \""Yay, I am a fan\""... Just feeling a little guilty, that my review may take down the rating of a great salon, but I need to be consistent.  \n\nAfter my Esthetician of 2 years decided to leave the industry, the past 6 months has proven to be a nightmare finding a replacement.  From only one experience, I can't say with certainty, but I may have found her!  I booked my appointment online via android... or so I thought. I called to confirm the day of, and it turns out it didn't go through. D'Lisa was so accommodating that she moved her facial scheduled at that time to get me in, because it was the only time I could go in that week. \n\nNow, we're talking a Brazilian here, so I don't expect to be skipped into the room. laughing during the process, and finishing up with hi-fives, but that's actually what the experience reminded me of.  (Of course minus the skipping and hi-fives).  D'Lisa was great. She was quick but thorough, and it was relatively painless.

23088,1,"My fiancee and I love sushi so we're very exited to see new sushi restaurant in our area. Unfortunately this place brought more disappointment then joy. Food was pretty average, service was slow, all thought restaurant was half empty. My fiancee was drinking Sprite but server refill his glass with water, we had to ask 3 times for more ginger and wasabi, just little things that make you very annoyed and wanting to never go back. I hope that owner of this place will hire better employees or help existing employees work on their customer service skills. I would hate to see such a beautiful restaurant in such a great location to go out of business because of poor service."
42790,1,"This place was not worth the price. The only reason it gets two stars is because the food was decent and the patio area is nice. They also have a groupon which is a plus. We went on a Saturday night at 9pm. We walked in the door and there was no hostess to greet us. We stood around until we finally got someone's attention. \n\nOnce we were seated we got our water glasses filled quickly but did not see a server for 15 minutes for even a drink order. I found this to be odd as the place was not busy at all. Once the server finally came over we ordered drinks and an appetizer. The calamari. The appetizer came out before 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine. The calamari was fried but very soggy. When served the appetizer, we ordered entrees. We were forced to order something every time the server came over, being  that we barely saw the guy. We all ate and we were satisfied with our food. \n\nWe paid the bill and I left a tip based on the service I received. We left the restaurant and the server ran after me (outside of the restaurant) and asked me to leave him a bigger tip. I was appalled. Don't go here. Not even worth the groupon. Service sucks."

13247,4,"Oasis in the midst of a desert. \n\nWe stayed in the Junior Executive suite and we're so glad we did. \n\nThis was my first, and most likely last, trip to Vegas. \n\n New Orleans (Mardi Gras) is kind of crazy but in a good way.Vegas is crazy but not in a good way. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nI have a cherished and beloved friend who decided to wed at Excalibur hotel. It was a medieval themed wedding and a queen and king need a castle. Sigh. \n\nAfter thorough research and countless hours spent on the bed bug registry, I thought The Bellagio would be a good choice. It seemed well priced, clean, and a bit away from the chaos of the strip.\n\nThank God, my traveling companion, who had been to Vegas prior, staunchly decided that we would stay here. I had kind of poo-pooed the idea at first because I thought it'd be very expensive but surprisingly it's not much more expensive than the Bellagio and for all you get it's practically a steal. Alas, he had been to Vegas before, he knew of the unspeakable horrors we would face, the loud obnoxious pool areas blasting various renditions of \""Now That's What I Call Music ...\"" and \""Summer Jams\"" during the day, the trashy, drunken, often morbidly obese, young adults and not so young adults that would be scantily and badly dressed, yet would be convinced that they looked hot, that we would run into at night ... Ugh, it was bad y'all. Real bad. \n\nI know it's called the  Sin City but seriously, isn't sinning supposed to be fun? \nI saw a lot of \""sinning\"" but it all just seemed so tawdry and cheap. Do you know they allow smoking in the casinos and hotels?! My God. My virgin nostrils had all but forgotten that offensive scent. Blech! \n\nAnyway, I digress ... Four Seasons was amazing.\n\nThe staff are more than helpful. As soon as you walk in you're greeted with the smell of yellow roses. The pool area is relatively quiet with light jazzy lounge music playing softly in the back. Sexy! \n\nI got a bikini wax at the spa and I have to say it's been the best one to date. The hotel restaurant, Verandah, has the best breakfast on the strip. Please get one of their delicious smoothies. Your taste buds will thank you.The room we stayed in had large windows that offered a wonderful view of the hills and the pool area. We stayed on the 39th floor (top floor) and I felt like I was on cloud nine.Bed was ultra comfy. Furnishings were classic yet modern and comfortable as well. I loved the scent of the bvlgari products stocked in the bathrooms. Noise or vulgarity of any kind was never an issue here. \n\nLocation was perfect. Excalibur, Aria, MGM, Luxor, Cosmopolitan and a number of other hotels/restaurants are a walk away (20-30 min. Depending on venue). Bellagio and Venetian are a bit of a hike further up, so you'd definitely need a taxi if you wanted to check those places out (and you might as well). We partied at MGM, Excalibur and Aria and come back to civilization in the evening. The hotel is on the strip but the craziest noise you'll hear is coming from Mandalay Bay -- They blast their pool music over into the Four Seasons area a little but nothing too imposing. The two hotels share the same building but of course Four Season is on the top floors :-) \n\n\nIf you get tired of all of the immature madness of the strip (and you should eventually) Four Seasons is a great place to call home and regain your sanity."
34035,4,"I gave this place 5 stars judging from their Avocado Boba Smoothies, which in my opinion is the best in Vegas. A lot of my coworkers suggested that this place has the best boba drinks considering they use real avocados and not the powder stuff that you get at Volcano tea. I always get the avocado boba with no sugar but with splenda. I guess that's my sugar free version of my boba drink...but so YUM! I actually think the prices are reasonable compared to the boba places here in Vegas. For a medium avocado I spent $3 cash. They also have stamp cards where 10 stamps and get the next drink free :)"
20145,3,"A few years ago, I came to outback almost every week.  Their food was amazing and I love their complimentary bread that they give.  But then they started to go down-hill.   The food was cutting it anymore and the service wasn't as great as I remembered it to be.  So, I stopped going to outback for about three years.\n\nBUT now, wow they changed their menu and added/removed a few items as well.  I was impressed!  They no longer have my favorite sinful sydney sundae, but they added milkshakes. Oh man was that AMAZING. I ordered the cappuccino milkshake, it is my new favorite dessert! It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't too powerful with the cappuccino.  It was just perfect. I am craving it as I am typing this review.\n\nThe entree was good, I ordered the half-order of baby back ribs.  It was tender and juicy.  I did not like the fries that much, but I was already full from the two complimentary breads that I ate and an appetizer. \n\nAppetizer, we ordered the steak nachos thing, it was interesting. The nachos or \""chips\"" was really good, but I feel like they didn't add enough steak on it.  \n\nService - he was a great and friendly server.  He seemed busy, but he kept all of us content and no complaints at all.  \n\nI think I am in love with outback again!"

We also started with the beef vegetable soup...took me back to my youth in England. Very authentic. The service and atmosphere was great too!
6790,0,"My wife and I ate here after reading the high reviews and were REALLY disappointed. We visited on a rainy day and they had buckets all over the restaurant to catch water from the leaking roof, and the bathroom was even worse. I've seen cleaner dive bar bathrooms. Serious. Aside from the buckets and bathroom, the food was mediocre at BEST. The sauces tasted like they came out of a can and the egg drop soup was terrible! We won't be back."
12781,0,"Stay away, this place is just a huge time share and they promise you the moon and after hours of what should be considered torture you feel emotionally drained. I wish I would have spit on the guy that stopped me in the street instead of give him the time of day"
17564,1,"I appreciate they have a large variety of vegetarian fares. In addition to normal bean filling; they have spinach, avocado and mushroom as options. The prices are cheap -- even cheaper if you order off the ala carte menu. Sometimes when you go at night, the servers can be hard to catch. The food is OK. I'm not a huge fan of the salsa/chips. I like the spiciness of the salsa but the chips usually seem quite salty. Despite all this, I still go here from time to time because it is quite cheap, dependable and open late."

I guess this is a new deal they started to compete with Bill's Gambling Hall across the street.\n\nThe wait at 2:30 AM was about 10 minutes. We all got the ribeye and eggs special. I noticed that the waiter only asked us how we would like our eggs but not our steak also. That's a red flag. And my sharp poker intuition didn't disappoint me. The ribeye was maybe half an inch thick BEFORE cooking since it was like a quarter inch when it came out. It was cooked well done and tasted like a ribeye I guess... It came with hash browns, eggs, and toast.\n\nPro-tip: This would have probably tasted better after a night of drinking"

The French fries are great and the drink sizes are huge.  A little pricey for a hot dog, fries and a drink but the quality is great, service is good and the place is very clean.  \n\nI recommend checking them out if you are a hot dog or hamburger fan.  Be prepared to wait longer than at a fast food joint because they do make them Fresh."

Mission accomplished. \n\nI checked out a couple of stellar establishments in the rust belt, but I want to review this one first. It was a very fun time, but the bar itself is kind of strange and riddled with questionable characters. I'm fairly certain I had a five minute conversation with someone who had recently been smoking crack... and I'm from Ford Nation so I should know. \n\nPEPPER PROPS to a friendly bar tender who poured cheap drinks happily and kept the shady folks in check. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: Come on, Pittsburgh.

33164,0,"I was sent to Tobler Physical Therapy by my neurologist's PA for rotator cuffs and neck.  I first had to check in with the front desk as they had already gotten my insurance information over the phone from me and called my insurance for my benefits.  When I went up to the front desk, they told me that I had already met my deductible and that my payments would be 18.00 each visit. The first visit went pretty well, Lee evaluated me so that I could be put on a program.  The second visit was different.  The women therapists like to chat a lot.  They seem to be more involved in what each of them had done over the weekend than what was going on with the patient.  Even though a routine had been planned for me, they rarely followed it.  I would stand around in between exercises waiting for them to finish their conversations.  They acted like I should know everything and on what setting I should do every exercise after just the first visit.  They NEVER watched me do my exercises to make sure that I was doing them right.  I would have to tell them that it hurts and I can't do this.  This happened each and every week, 2 times a week.  One day they heard that the owner was coming.  Boy did they get busy then.  Lee decided that I wasn't making much progress and recommended that I allow him to adjust my neck.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I told him that Dr. Fitzpatrick, the first neurologist that evaluated me, told me that I was never to have another adjustment of any kind because of the 5 deteriorated discs in my neck, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7 as it could be very dangerous.  I brought my MRI for Lee to see.  I didn't feel that they took me very seriously, I guess they think they know better than Barrows.  I paid my 18.00 each visit thinking each time that it wasn't even worth that.  I stopped going after 11 visits.  Then I received a phone call from their billing department in Georgia?? telling me that my insurance did not pay as I had NOT met my deductible yet.  What???  They told me that I now owe over 600.00!!  Not for this unprofessional service!  18.00 was too much!  I have since had surgery on my right rotator cuff for torn rotator cuff, bicep tendon torn 90%, torn sub scapula tendon and two others that were torn.  I have every color twine, 2 titanium anchors and 2 plastic anchors in my shoulder.  My left shoulder is just as bad and I am scheduled for surgery on June 28th.  I guess that if they were watching me do my exercises, they have noticed!!!  After my surgery I went to Dynamic Rehab off of Higley Rd by Banner Hospital.  They are absolutely great!!  They are professional and they WATCH me!  They can tell when I am not carrying myself right and where the problem is.  Again they observe and help!  I cannot stress enough the unprofessionalism of Tobler Physical Therapy and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  What a joke!  I told my neurologist Dr. Yeung and he said he wouldn't pay either.  If you want a good physical rehab, DON'T go here, you will be worse when they get done with you than you were when you went in like I was."

Popped truly is revolutionizing the popcorn industry with it's fresh made, dye-free popcorn flavors. And their \""Dragon's Breath\"" nitro-pop is as cool as it gets! I love the sample bowls hanging from the ceiling and the relaxed, inviting vibe the shop has. Forget coffee shops and their noisy grinders!

46629,2,"I'm in agreement with Al M about the amount of food you get for the $.\nThe portions during 'Iraqi week' were almost insulting. The meat on my plate consisted of just 3 teeny (but still tasty) meatballs. The beers, while exotic to some, are available at most SAQs so don't expect something out of Saint-Bock's selection. Some of the patrons were the owner's embarrassingly drunk friends, stumbling out of the back room. I've never seen people under 40 at bar looking like such bummers. I admit it soaks in style, weird decor and music. I really wanted to love this place but I left way too hungry."

This place has ample parking, and really when can you say that about a restaurant?\n\nYou order your food at the counter and take your number to your seat. I got the chicken in a pita. Delicious per usual. Your pita does not look that big until you start eating it. Then it is this monstrous everest of a meal. The chicken is seasoned and little bite to it. The seasoning is fantastic. The yogurt sauce is a nice compliment to the flavorful chicken. \n\nThey offer cucumber water on the house or you can purchase a bottles beverage (alcoholic or not). \n\nThe jewel of this place is their falafel. This is HANDS DOWN, the BEST falafel I have had ever. Not just in Madison, which is a black hole of falafel, but in life. Just eat it.

18797,2,Is a pretty large storage facility with a lot of different size units. The facility is pretty clean. I use it to store files so I have the smaller unit they offer.

Magnan's has been around for 75 year and used to be a men only establishment (not a strip club). My father brought me here years ago to have dinner and watch a hockey game. Back then Magnan's was decorated the way you would expect an old school tavern would be, lots of dark wood, sports memorabilia and big TV's. Five or six years ago the owners started updating the decor and adding new dishes to the menu to attract the new urban professionals who were moving into the neighborhood. in the summer Magnan's has by far the nicest patio / terasse in the area, with both a covered and open aired section.\n\nThe service here is always quick and efficient, you wont find young inexperienced wait staff. everyone who works here are professional waiters and waitresses with years of experience under their belt. I've always received fast service even on the busiest hockey night. This being said the wait staff aren't always the sunniest of people. I suggest you know what you want when you call your waiter over for your order.\n\nThe food is good, nothing special even if they seem to be known for their roast beef. I usually have the hamburger but I've had the roast beef in the past and I can say the roast is good but the vegetables remind me of the boiled veggies my high school served on Tuesday. I guess this is a throw back to it's working class tavern day but for the price they charge I'd like to see a more varied choice of sides. Magnan's is also renowned for their lobster and oyster festivals held late in the summer and during the fall.\n\nIf you find yourself in Pointe-Saint-Charles and want to have a good meal in an old school tavern with more ambiance then you can shake a stick at on hockey nights Magnan's is a good choice, just keep in mind it's a tavern that charges premium prices."

23676,4,This place is heavenly!!! I have dreams about it on a regular basis. The cookies are so fresh and you can choose two different kinds and two different ice cream flavors. TASTY!
4713,2,"Food: \nfood was good, not great. \n\nPrice: \nmore expensive than other restaurants I've been to. \n\nService: \nThe guy who took my order (take out) seemed too serious and uptight, but the woman who gave me my order was friendly. \n\nOverall, would not come back."
49402,0,"I had high hopes for this place when I heard that it was opening. Asian food in the heart of Vegas's newest attraction, the Linq. That sounds like good news to me and good is what I was expecting. Unfortunately, my hopes were shot down soon after watching my friend order food. \n\nThey have a boba place inside as well as a place where you can order dishes like a restaurant and a place where you can order food down a line like Panda Express. Looking at the prices that they had at the boba place, it was a little pricy and I can't expect it to have that much better quality than somewhere off the strip, and so I deem the price a little higher than normal. I understand rent must be expensive, but they won't be making money with higher prices. \n\nThe area where you can order food had a variety of dishes from different Asian cuisines, but this again was a little expensive. I can't imagine it tasting any better than somewhere off the strip at a specific ethnic restaurant, and especially for the price they were charging, $11 for fried rice is a little much. They also have dim sum & dumplings and they list it out what kind they have on the window. The prices are a little expensive for how much they give you, which is the usual 4 at traditional dim sum places. $4.99+ for an order is not worth getting while you are there, you might as well go out somewhere else off the strip for dim sum. \n\nThe area where you can pick out food like at Panda Express was also pricy and it didn't look very good, it seemed as though it was sitting out there for a while. When my friend ordered food from there, she got the duck and they microwaved it... You know, when you're at home at they're leftovers, it's ok to microwave food, but when you order food from outside of your own home, that ain't cool bro. That right there was just shocking for me that a place would even do that. So I don't think the food will look too appetizing unless it came fresh out of the kitchen, just make sure they don't microwave the food before they give it to you.\n\nLast but not least, when my friend's food was finished, they brought the food out to where we were sitting. When the waitress (or whatever category you want to put them in) brought out her food, the tray didn't have utensils and the waitress said she forgot and asked her to get it herself. Umm... I think that's a little bit rude to say, and you have a job where you mostly stand right next to the front anyways, so I don't understand why she couldn't have just gotten them right after. \n\nI don't mind the higher prices of the places inside the Linq, I can at least understand that much, but when you have unappealing food, microwave food, and have bad service, that's a big nono there. Eat before you go to the Linq if you can."
34811,3,Great place to chill out and have a laugh with friends. You can let the kids run riot here as it has play park as well as tennis courts and a great pitch and putt 18 hole golf course set up in it as well so take your own clubs as it's free but you can hire clubs if you don't have your own. On main bus route into town and has selection of bars/restaurants nearbye.
43779,2,"The food is good, but I don't like the religious references in the name or in the decor. I am not a religious person and do not believe in god. I am not keen on being surrounded by Bible quotes when I'm eating lunch. The hipster decor belies the religious backstory, and perhaps that's intentional. I will probably not visit again for this reason. That is my personal choice based upon my beliefs, just as it is the owner's personal choice and right to establish a business based upon his or her religious beliefs. After the recent Hobby Lobby decision by the Supreme Court, I will not frequent any businesses that are owned by religious interests."
36891,0,"I came here based on a friend's referral. The lady who did my nails was EXTREMELY unprofessional. First, she left me in the middle of the procedure to go get a jacket. She came back after five minutes and proceeded to continue without apologizing for her rude interruption. Then she picked up a call and started talking, once again stopped doing my nails. She was so rough with my hands such as: pulled it towards her forcefully, pinched my fingers, cut my cuticles too deep, etc. I brushed these actions off because I'm not the type to demand my money back. So she had a LOT of white nail polish on my fingertips and I asked her to take it off. She did as I told and there was still polish on my fingertips. I asked for her to remove the specks. She then proceeded to speak in Vietnamese (which I understand) to the other manicurist \""She's so picky. There's nothing even there.\"" I sat there. Just BAFFLED. But once again, I brushed it off. My friend said I could get a discount because of connections so I was talking to her about it (she was sitting next to me getting her nails done). I guess the manicurist heard & after she finished my nails she said \""pay me here.\"" and I was like I don't go to the front? & she kept demanding me to pay. Then she said \""tip too?\"" when I didn't give enough.\nHORRIBLE SERVICE. I'm still enraged by the horrific treatment to this day."
331,2,"My husband and I went here on a Friday night and surprising were seated immediately at a sidewalk table even though we did not have a reservation. Girasole was, as advertised, a very charming cafe with many things to recommend it. \n\nThe food was good, but it lost some points with both of us for quality of service and the limited nature of the menu. Our waiter was attentive--until the entrees were served. Then he disappeared. Not only did he disappear but every other server went deaf. They were not so busy that this was necessary. For the size of the restaurant and the number of servers it should not have taken an additional 20 minutes after we had eaten to have plates cleared.  There was a busboy but he was kind of useless. \n\nMy husband had the ravioli and I had polenta, both of which were very nice, and we shared a slice of rum cake that was excellent. My suggestion to anyone going there is to look at the online menu first. What you see there is what they will have, period. If nothing looks good it may be a good night to try another spot."
4483,2,"The place is beatiful, the food was ok, nothing spectacular...  The service was SLOW!!!!!  we all got rather irritated over how long it took to get our food, and we all ordered the same thing, the steak and lobster, we must have waited almost 30 min... \n\nI doubt i will be returning."
44217,4,The SoHo Gourmet food cart is so yummy. The So Chick dumplings are my favorite. The salads compliment the dumplings very well. Love that new rice boxes are being offered this year. I had a sample of the rice today. It was really good. I knew I should gotten out earlier.
40160,4,"Yum you have to try it. Loved the cheesy margarita the sauce was just the perfect amount a bit garlicky very tasty. The cheese was oozing out and delicious the dough was crispy and chewy, just right. The desert kono with nutella is loaded with nutella, I couldn't finish it. The owner was really nice the place was very casual good seating area great music there's a table outside with 2 chairs. U get 1 for 5 or 6$ or one kono with choice of desert or salad with drink for 10$. Try it out it's an awesome Italian concept !"
39123,1,"The vibe is low key, more cafe/coffeehouse than public house. \n\nSpotted with mismatched chairs and tables, pop(ish) art clipped creatively to the walls, you order and pay at the counter and find a seat. Very casual, very college.\n\n (-) Let me just say that I am not a fan of the Ipad POS system. I'm immediately given the option to tip 15%, 20%, 25%, or nothing. Normally in an order-at-the-counter-and-seat-yourself situation where I don't have an actual sever, I'd tip a dollar or so but I ended up tipping 15% before I had even seen my drinks. \n\n(+) Coffee and tea selections are good (Intelligentsia) and they offer about ten sandwiches. The barista was very helpful in suggesting a roast for my very basic coffee drinking boyfriend. Our sandwiches came out before our drinks and I reminded the barista who dropped them off of our orders. He said they'd be right out. \n\n(-) Second mini-rant, this place needs order/table numbers. Walking out of the kitchen and \""auctioning\"" off food is not complimenting the laid-back vibe. It looks inefficient and chaotic and I'm pretty sure people are ending up with the wrong beverages. Unfortunately, we finished our meals before our coffee and tea had even arrived and when I went to request that they be made to go I watched the staff realize the ticket had been thrown out with our food order. \n\n(-/+) The barista was apologetic but sorry should be an action not a statement, especially in service industries and I would have liked to have been refunded for the drinks. After all, we waited over 25 minutes for a coffee and tea. \n\n(+) Oh yeah, and the food was pretty good."
37283,4,Trisha is *awesome*
10999,0,The sandwiches were good. The service was horrible. We placed an order at a location that wasn't this one... The wrong number was given on line. When we went to pick up order here... they made us go to the other restaurant to pick up the order at the other location. What kind of customer service is this??? We are on vacation... we had to get our car out of valet parking and drive to the other place. What was supposed to be a cheap and easy transaction turned into a total hassle.
25414,1,"I love to hate this place.  The location can't be beat, it's more of a hassle for me to drive here because of one way streets than it is to walk the couple of blocks from my apartment.  It has everything a regular big box chain grocery store should have, and then some.  The bread slicer is quite convenient (pro tip: stick a baguette in the bread slicer for super easy buschetta for a crowd).  The selection of fresh fish is great.  I find the produce pricey, but of good quality and variety.\n\nThe not so good part is that I have to agree with Mike S., the staff is generally quite rude.  I try to avoid going through a regular cash if at all possible, and will choose to wait for a self service cash, because I have had so many bag experiences with cashiers and baggers.  Everytime I think it's me, I just have to go to PA on Parc or another big chain grocery, to realize that I only have problems here.  With the price of groceries always on the rise, I want to actually be able to enjoy the food I buy.  That means no manhandling my bread, or throwing produce.   It also means not putting my groceries into a million flimsy plastic bags when I have an armfull of sturdy reusable bags that I'm trying to hand over.  Whenever I try to politely to ask the staff to please be a little more careful, or to use my reusable bags, I'm met with standoffish gruff staff.  I once had a cashier yell at me for accusing the packer of squishing my bread.  I didn't accuse him of squishing my bread, I just asked that they not ram the rest of the groceries into it.\n\nThe other not so good aspect of things is that the store can get really packed.  Monday through Wednesday evenings student discounts are offered, which means there are a lot more packs of roomates going shopping together.  It's also pretty packed on Sunday afternoon due to the proximity to tamtams.  And forget popping in on your way home from work to pick up something for dinner if you work a standard 9 to 5, you'll be there for quite awhile.  \n\nSo I get around all of the above by going early on the weekends, when the store is empty and I have my choice of self serve machines."
15184,4,"I frequent Vegas and usually stays at the Bellagio, needless to say I've tried all the restaurants the hotel has to offer, some multiple times! Noodles is one of my favorite eats at the Bellagio (as well as the entire strip). \n\nThe restaurant itself is very clean and nicely decorated; staff are friendly and food usually comes out pretty fast. Reasonably priced for hotel restaurant standards. Most dishes are about $18+, with decent sized portions.\n\nMost of their appetizers are nothing to write home about with the exception of the Roti Prata (Roti bread with curry sauce), the curry has just the right amount of kick without being too sweet. The Laksa curry noodle is my favorite dish hands down (huge portion too). Perfectly cooked noodles in a rich coconut curry broth. It's a little spicy so I don't recommend this for people who like their food mild. Another recommendation is the sea bass congee. Mildly seasoned and the fish is very fresh, great choice for someone who is looking for something tasty and light. Their BBQ is surprisingly good and authentic, duck and bbq pork are the two popular choices. Though it can be a little too salty at times. Be sure to try their Mango pudding as well as fresh mango served with a side of coconut sesame rice (forgot the actual name of the dish) if you're craving for something sweet. \n\nNice restaurant, friendly service and great food. There's really nothing to not like about Noodles. Only downside is they tend to get pretty busy, if you go during dinner time there's usually a wait."
24402,2,"I've ordered some great gifts online from them, and when I was recently in Madison I had to stop by. They have an amazing selection of cheeses, but I wasn't as blown away as I had hoped. Maybe it was because they were a bit busy, but no one said hello or offered any help until we had been in the store for at least 15 minutes. I guess that just turned me off a little bit.\nHowever, if I lived nearby I can imagine that I would be in here a lot. They have some good looking cheeses in those cabinets, and I would eagerly try every one at least once."

22224,3,"I've been here twice and both times it's been a great experience.  Don't let the name fool you...It's actually an Indian restaurant not Mediterannean.  Great food and great service.  They do not have a liquor license so they allow customers to bring their own wine to drink.  At most Indian restaurants I've been to usually you have to order the naan or rice a la carte.  Here at Kabab Palace if you order a la carte, you also get plain naan and rice with your entree.  I think it's a smart business practice to do that."
47121,1,"I really wanted to like Social, I really did, yet while they have a great space, both the service and food was lacking.  I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my fiance and two other dining companions. My fiance and I had been looking forward to coming here since we noticed that it opened.  From the street it looked like a fun place and the same could be said whenever we walked up to it.  Outside of the restaurant is some patio seating and a ping pong table while the inside has a dominating bar in the middle with seating around the outside.  There is a lot of open space though and so it feels quite large.\n\nAfter looking at the menu I was having a hard time making a decision as to what I wanted for dinner.  This night I was not in a mood for a sandwich which pretty much left me the options of having a salad or a pizza.  They did have an interesting concept for the salad though where you could make your own.  They had a pad of paper and you could pick the toppings that you wanted on the pad and give it to the server.  I ended up passing on that as it seemed too pricey and ultimately went with a large Pierogie Pizza.  Whenever it came out my first though was that the name was misleading as the pizza had cheese, some onions, scallions, some potato pieces that reminded me of home fries, only a bit larger, and pancetta.  Granted I know that in its simplest form a pierogie is potato, dough and topped with onions but I still think they would be better off to call this a loaded baked potato pizza as that resemblance is much stronger.  No matter what it was called, I can't say that I enjoyed it too much though.  The crust was at least done right as it was a little crispy and had a good taste to it.  The sauce was MIA and I honestly couldn't tell if there was any of the garlic oil that was mentioned on the menu on my pizza.  Finally the toppings were good although not exactly what I had been expecting with the caramelized onions being my favorite part.  Beyond the food I have two other things to note about our experience.  The first is that our waitress was slooow.  I understand that she had tables both inside and outside (poor decision by the manager?) but she went missing for long periods at times which made it difficult to order extra drinks.  The second item is that one of our dining companions had a quite large and sharp piece of a walnut shell in her salad.  She bit into it and hurt one of her teeth pretty good on it.  We were not looking for a free meal or anything from it and pointed it out to the waitress who said something like \""Ohh\"".  Awesome, we just wanted you to let the kitchen know so that they could be more careful.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future but certainly not for food.  Both the service and the food disappointed me and while I did not order any of their drinks, they have a nice list and I was eying them up and imagine that I could enjoy one in the environment that Social has."
1142,3,"This place is a lot of fun as a result of the atmosphere and pleasant wait staff!  The menu rocks a combination of vegetarian items, low carb items, and greasy guilty pleasures.\n\nThe only problem is that it may be difficult to locate parking during peak hours, especially when a sporting event is taking place.\n\nDoes anyone know how frequently Mr. Cooper makes appearances in his restaurant?  I'm just curious..."
26900,3,Just a solid neighborhood pub. Good atmosphere. Good English tap list. Didn't eat anything. Impressive selection of scotch. Was full 2pm on mon.
33752,0,"Extremely disappointed! I went in blindly and walked out feeling taken advantage of! The owner reminds me of a sleazy used car salesman. I asked if I could make monthly payment without auto deduction, he said yes, then AFTER taking my first payment he said that it has to be automatically deducted! He failed to tell me about all of the other expenses. There is a graduation every 8 weeks that costs $60 and every kid graduates whether they deserve to or not. The classes are only 30 mins and so full of kids that yours can easily be lost in the mix. Then, he pushes you to sign up for a leadership program that cost $20 more on top of the ridiculous $137 a month! After your child has moved up to next class, then he wants a whopping $613 for the equipment that's required for that class! The whole time he is pushing your child to refer more kids to the class, giving out cards for your kid to pass out to friends and promoting his business! This owner is way more concerned about making more money then teaching your child! Don't make the pricey mistake that I did, you will not be happy, go anywhere but here."

39579,3,"Took a date night in Pittsburgh over the holidays.  Made a reservation for 2 a week in advance, which was a good thing because the place was booked solid.\n\nAfter getting very good cocktails at the bar (sloe gin fizz and glenshaw sour) we were seated at exactly 7p.  Not a big restaurant - it's one big room, high ceilings, with the bar at the center and tables around the edges and had a nice lively feel.  \n\nDraft list was on a chalkboard on the wall, and had some great seasonal and local selections.  Only special was the mussels of the day, which looked good but we're not mussels people.\n\nStarted with pate, which was an ample portion, and the seasonal salad, both hit the spot.  Lamb burger was good-sized and excellent.  Korean Reuben could have used a little more kimchi since it really did go well with the corn beef, but it was an interesting and enjoyable (and large) sandwich.  Couldn't even finish all the french fries served with each sandwich since we wanted dessert.  We went with gingerbread cake which was fresh and delicious but we couldn't help thinking it would have been better after 10 seconds in a microwave.  They brought it with a candle since we were celebrating my husband's birthday.\n\nService was professional and friendly and the server was helpful with beer and food selections.  We were happy with the prices we paid which were very reasonable for the quantity and quality of what we got.  We are partial to gastropubs in general and this was a very good one - would recommend to anyone to try."
7005,3,"I still have to take away a star because it's just still so confusing. There was no entrance-fee wackiness this time, but I was still completely lost. Don't get me wrong, I love this museum. It's amazing. It's the perfect place to go if you -want- to get lost and wander for hours. But if you're going for something specific, sometimes it can be a little tricky to get to it.\n\nI went to see Making Waves (contemporary Japanese prints) specifically. I wasn't sure what gallery they were in, so we just started out by wandering around. Found some amazing contemporary Chinese paintings. After more wandering, we still hadn't found Making Waves, so we ended up asking a series of PAM employees/volunteers.\n\n1st employee: \""Oh, that exhibit is right in this gallery *points at map*\"" \nWe go there... and it's the Chinese paintings. Not Japanese prints.\n\n2nd employee: \""I'm pretty sure it's in this gallery, here *points at another gallery on map*\""\nNada.\n\n3rd employee: \""I'm not sure, maybe it's this way?\""\nNope.\n\n4th employee: \""Wait... do you mean you want the Firefly exhibit?\""\n.....no. \n\nFinally, someone got us to Making Waves, which was in one of the few nooks we hadn't already wandered into by accident. Talk about painful. \n\nAnyway, Making Waves was great. We also checked out the previously mentioned Firefly exhibit, which is a permanent (yes!!!) installation called \""You Who Are Getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies.\"" It's amazing, disorienting, and totally trippy. Check it out."
14821,2,"Oh PCL, where do I start? PCL is a lounge and club wanna be, it's set up like a lounge with the addition of a couple stripper poles (not equipped with strippers), blares music like a club... but beside the stripper poles there is nowhere for me to dance!  The \""dance floor\"" is basically just a big walkway in between the bar and the bathroom.  Like most OT clubs there is a line to get it, I can't fault them for that, and besides on NYE I have never had to pay to get in.   Inside the d\u00e9cor is pretty funky and the service is decent for a busy club, I mean lounge... oh whatever!  The bathroom is set up for the capacity of the people who sit at the tables on the inside perimeter, but it is not sufficient for the amount of people they let in to occupy the \""dance floor\"".   PCL is definitely not my favorite place to go in OT, but it's currently pretty trendy and all our other options keep closing, or are \""remodeling\"", so kudos for keeping a float!"
5715,0,Puke Palace!!!\n\nAdvisory: This location ONLY!\n\nI use to come here on my lunch breaks because it was right next to where I used to work. I would walk here almost once a week...JUST FOR CONVENIENCE! We only got a half hour lunch so I had to go somewhere close and the only other option was Mc Donald's and I'm not a big fan! \n\nSo hmmm where do I begin? Yes its that bad! \n\nOk the 1st time I came here I ordered a bacon cheese burger combo which after tax was like $8.00bucks!!!...OMG it took 20 minutes for me to get my order which meant I had to scarf this nasty sickening burger down in 5 mins because I still had to walk back to work and clock in! \n\nNot to mention on top of it taking forever to cook it was under cooked I saw it was rare pink!!! I was so pissed off and had no time to complain I just ate the thing and left to work. \n\nI tried this place a few more times only because I didn't have time to eat anywhere else. \n\nThe second time I ate here I tried there chicken strips. UMMM they were tasty but had blue dots streaming through them...not sure what that was but hey I'm still living! \n\nAfter trying various items I came to realize the only tasty and safe thing to order was their chili cheese fries which after tax came to almost 6 bucks for a large. \n\nLuckily I do not nearby anymore and will NOT be returning! \n\n*NASTY FOOD \n*OVER PRICED \n*DIRTY AND FILTHY DINE IN \n*DRUGGED OUT EMPLOYEES \n\nPS: The employees are ALL NASTY and DRUGGED OUT!!! \n\nI witnessed an employee with dirty finger nails.

27695,4,"Dropped in for a happy hour visit today and were super glad we did so.  What a cool place!  While it isn't the biggest place you will find, it is exactly the kind if place you would want to hang out with, either by yourself, with a friend, or a bunch of friends.  The atmosphere is hard to beat.  \n\nThe bartender( he might have been the owner/manager) was super attentive and understands what customer service is all about.  One guy asked him to make some shot ( he gave him a slip of paper with ingriedents) that he had had at some other bar.  It was supposed to be triple layered and when it didn't come out quite how the guy wanted it, he Goggled it and tried to replicate it for him.  It still wasn't quite what the guy wanted....I would have told him to just get a shot of tequila and man up!  We were amazed how patient he was and how genuinely intent on making that stupid drink the way the guy wanted it.   \n\nHe definitely took care of us and we will be back.  Looks like there are lots of possibilities, on lots of different days, for a good time here.\n\nNote to first timers:  Entering off of McDowell can be tricky. The McDowell entrance is not left turn friendly. It is located above the Pei Wei and Starbucks. The easiest way to enter seems to be off of 7th Ave.  Turn into the lot right after you pass McDowell.\n\nMovie during our Happy Hour: Escape From New York..love it!  The music in the place is awesome too."

9442,3,"SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL\n\nBefore we packed our Vegas bags, I commented to my husband that while there, I wanted to find a cheap lobster dinner. Some wives probably ask to be taken out to a nice lobster dinner. I wanted a nice dinner too, don't get me wrong, but I knew a cheap lobster dinner could be found and I wanted us to find it.\n\nWe were there less than 48 hours when dinner found us! We had been walking around Downtown Vegas and seen signs on the Fremont Hotel for an $11.99 steak and lobster dinner. I pointed it out with excitement. Unfortunately, we weren't hungry! But....after a couple more hours strolling and dancing, our appetites caught up and it happened to be between the hours the special was being served!\n\nWe had a 30 minute wait and we were not alone. The waiting area was packed! We were finally sat and our server (George) dropped off menus on his way to take another order. He returned not long after with a smile, even though I'd watched him scurry from table to table in the interim. His section was slammed and one booth was pretty impatient about not having received their bill yet. We decided we weren't in a hurry and placed identical orders (lobster and extra rare steak). I added a side dish of garlic green beans to mine.\n\nBread service came. A plate of Promise (buttery spread) packets came with it. A serious mound of fake butter! We ate our share until the dinners arrived.\n\nI don't anything nice to say about the flat piece of steak I received, except that it was very rare and it wasn't bad dipped in butter, but mine was mostly fat. Husband ate all of his and said it was about what he expected. We both agreed the lobster was better than expected. They were tiny tails but they were tender and well-seasoned and the drawn butter coated the bites nicely. My green beans were actually terrible. Rubbery and not much garlic to be found. For the meal we received, the excellent service, and the cost, overall I would say we found a great value here!  ($28.40 total)\n\nA good server can really set the tone for the evening. George's contagious smile kept us smiling all night too."
35711,3,"I went there again today and this time had the Sin City smashburger..... It was just as good as the Spicy Baja burger, the Sin City had bacon, an egg, lettuce, cheese, and crispy onions. It makes me want to go try another item off the menu soon."
8148,2,"The guy working there was nice.\nTheir food is not great at all.\nThere is a full bar, which is nice.\nThere is nothing on draft (all bottles).\nBut they accept credit cards, so that is good."
17433,1,"We were staying in the excalibur (NOT my choice... ugh) and decided to eat breakfast at the buffet out of convenience. Ugh. We waited for 40 minutes to get in and once we got in I waited another 35 minutes for an omelet. there were only like 4 people in front of me... I don't know how it possibly took so long, but the BF was able to eat a complete plate of food while I was waiting. The food wasn't inedible, but it was definitely the worst buffet food I've had in vegas. We decided to wait for them to turn the buffet over to lunch, but once they did there was nothing that looked good enough to eat. It was like they opened frozen dinners and put them into chaffing dishes. Don't waste your money here."
3500,2,"I have been on a Chinese food kick lately, and with not a lot of Chinese food in the area, Qwik Chinese is really my only option.  My coworker is in love with this place and has been raving about it for months so I decided to give it a try.  I have been three times now, and while I like some of the dishes, I have been very disappointed with the rest, especially since I think Gary who runs the place is just such a nice guy and I want to keep coming back.\n\nThe best thing that I have had here by far is the Shrimp Lo Mein, they don't skimp on the shrimp and the noodles have lots of flavor.  I also have enjoyed the Crab Rangoon a couple of times, they are generous with the filling, but I wish they were folded over like a turnover rather than the fancy flower shape, they would be much easier to eat that way!\n\nMy disappointments have come when I venture away from the lo mein.  The sesame chicken was just weird, I had to just throw it away, I was too scared to eat it.  The Mongolian pork was actually pretty tasty, but the ratio of green onions to pork was like 3:1, so I felt like I had been ripped off.  Last time I decided to try the orange beef; the beef was surprisingly tender but it had no flavor, it just tasted like beef, the orange sauce was completely lacking and I was sorely disappointed.\n\nI will probably get food from here again because it is close by and really the only option I have, but I am probably just going to stick to the shrimp lo mein and crab puffs and call it a day."
22202,3,"This place is interesting. It's strictly a take out spot and they open from 5-10pm. Definitely not your average Thai food joint. \n\nOverall the food is great and my personal favorite is the Mango Sticky Rice. They actually give you a bigger portion of sticky rice here than anywhere else I've been. \n\ncleanliness is key here. Seeing as to how they don't actually have tables here so you can eat, I'd be surprised if it was dirty. \n\nThe lady is pretty friendly and straight to the point. It looked like if it was just her and another employee so probably family. \n\nOverall its small, quaint, cheap and fantastic! definitely recommend this for them nights that you want to stay home and watch a movie!"
23390,4,"If you find yourself in need of eyeglasses...this is the place to go.  My prescription requires a very high correction. Visited all the local vendors, Sears, Pearl Vision, Eye Glass world, Sams, Walmart. Someone mentioned Costco to me....they blew all the other vendors out of the water. They have a great selection of frames, many options are included in the price. Didn't try to up-sell to something I couldn't afford.....When you need new fames/lens this is your one stop shop"
5625,2,everyone is super nice here. wait is never too long. \n\ntwo gripes.\n\n1.) had commercials for e-cigarettes on the tv.\n2.) they never seem to send my x-rays or mri scans when they say they will to my doctors...
31785,1,"I just noticed this was so highly rated and wanted to send a little more reality the way of the burrito drive. The only thing it has going for it is the fact it delivers, and would pass for a business meeting or simple catered event. If you are looking to go out to enjoy some Mexican food-you can look pretty much anywhere else and be happier.  \n\nI've tried this place a couple times over a year ago now, but doubt anything has changed. I disagree with the implication that chipotle or qdoba is inferior to this place. They are comparable, but I would rank chipotle significantly higher. So long as you don't think of this place as a mexican restaurant or receive the food for free, you might not be disappointed.\n\nCome here to remind yourself just how good places like El Pastor and Taqueria Guadalajara are."
1252,3,"Big rooms. Clean but have a smell to them. The included 7a-10a buffet breakfast is good (needs sausages,though). Nice to have that refrigerator & microwave,too. Free shuttle to the airport on the half hour was extremely convenient. Tipping at breakfast and with the shuttle (which can take or pick you up at places in less than a 2 mile radius) is appreciated just the same as you would your housekeeper."
19351,2,They probably only get my order right half of the time but they are so friendly and makes up for it and that is why I keep coming back.
17251,2,"I did not like this location AT ALL.   I was overwhelmed on where to park... I couldn't figure out if you park in front or back.  Then I couldn't figure out where the front door was or where you get seated at.  I walked in a complete circle around the place 1 1/2 times.  Then it is dark and crowded.  The service was very hurried and it was not conducive to sitting and enjoying a meal together as there were people waiting for our table (if you are even lucky enough to get a private table).  I much much much prefer the Dobson/Guadalupe location and won't return to this one.\n\nHowever, the food is delicious.  The potato leek soup.  Yummmmm... the bread it is served with is Yummmmm... the pasty was Yummmm (I had the vegetarian potato one with ketchup).  Wish I had saved room for the peanut butter and jelly dessert one as I like it so much."
38640,3,"My husband and I have eaten here multiple times and I've taken several friends here for lunch.  It's been excellent every time and the service is always friendly and informative.  I guess it's not perfect judging from some other reviews, but you just can't please everyone every time.  It's great neighborhood spot."
42193,2,"We have visited this buffet twice now.  One successful visit.  The other not.\n\nOn our first visit, we were surprised to find over 100 people in line.  Well, it was Easter Sunday.  Folks waiting with us said that the line was nothing, it was usually a lot longer.  And wouldn't you know, by the time we got to the front of the line, there were over 200 people in line behind us.  Western Pennsylvanian's do like a good buffet.\n\nThe interior furnishings are already starting to show wear.  The seats of many of the chairs are fairly worn and needs to be replaced.  Service here was fairly attentive considering the huge crowd.  And they keep your mimosas and bloody Mary's glasses full the entire time.  And crab legs for everyone.  Apparently, they were everyone's favorite.  For me, I was all about the peel and eat shrimp.  They were incredibly tasty and I couldn't get enough!  Another win win for me was the salad bar.  Very fresh, good dressings and toppings.  I went back a couple times.  As for the hot dishes, some were meh.  A little favor less, others a little cold.  The ham was great, the prime rib was a little rare for my taste.  But the dessert bar?  OMG, lots of tiny little yummy choices.  I wanted to take one of everything!  \n\nAnd what about our unsuccessful visit?  That was on Mother's Day.  And everyone was taking their Mother to the Grandview Buffet.  They had to be over 300 people in line!  So, we went elsewhere.  If you are going on a holiday, it's probably a good idea to go early!"
10241,0,The reason for this one star review is because there is NO possibility of sleep at this hotel on the weekends and they simply don't care. It is 3:23AM as I write this with front desk informing me it will last till 4:00 AM. \nLike many who come here for conventions - this is deeply disturbing when one must get up early for work - and to pay high Vegas rates for a top property.
5933,2,"If you're looking for greasy Chinese delivery, look no further.  Two pad thais and two egg rolls came to less than $20.  The pad thais were huge and left more than enough for next-day lunch leftovers.  The egg rolls were pretty greasy but hit the spot.  Not the greatest food I've ever eaten, but sometimes a girl just needs some really greasy noodles.\n\nDelivery available through Meals Delivered. and Campus Food.  (Campus Food is cheaper.)"
27084,3,"It all started with a sign written mirrored. I began reading it without paying attention to how it was written. \""If you can read this, you haven't drank enough\"" or something to that effect. I walked inside. Initially, I thought the store only featured olive oils. Oh, it's so much more than that.\n\nNow, I have friends that blend fruits and vodkas, so I ignored that portion. That's when I noticed the cask strength whiskey selections. I purchased two varieties after asking the gentleman behind the counter some questions. 100ml samples are a breeze. If you're a first time customer like me, be sure to factor in the 100 ml glass bottle costs (3.80 each). He gave us additional information about the casks and also pointed out that for traveling purposes, those bottles are clearly stamped 100ml on the bottom in case airport security has questions. Good man to anticipate my needs. \n\nCheers to Scotland and Demijohn."
43068,3,"I had the chance to try this place the other day on UNLV  campus. I ordered the Bloody Bay and it was so yummy!\n\nPrices weren't too bad and service was quick! Definitely, going back to try some of the loaded waffle fries!"
44492,2,"Very quaint spot, Cozy and modern. \nThe food was good, I was disappointed with the portions. Our waiter said it was family style but I'm not sure what size family he meant because for a party of 3 small women, it was barely enough for us.  He was kind but not super attentive. We also had drunk all of our water and without us requesting another bottle, they brought one. Only thing is, we didn't know we were being charged for it without our consent.\nThe brown bagged apple pie with salted caramel ice cream was superb however, as well as the white sangria."
36477,2,If you get lucky to snag on of the 4 or 5 tables out on the balcony overlooking Freemont Street you have scored.  $3.25 for a cocktail.  Great place to rest your weary feet for awhile.

I protested on behalf of the player that she had placed the offered bet BEFORE the dealer turned over, but the pit boss would not deliver the offered bet!\n\nFrom this moment henceforth, I shall never deliver a single dollar unto the MLIFE consortium on account of terrible customer service, taking advantage of inexperienced gamblers, and poor pit boss judgement.\n\nI had been hopeful of the perks of my MLIFE membership, but am now forever forlorn.\n\nG"
12841,1,This is a pretty crappy and old hotel. The room was dusty and had several missing items such as cups and laundry bags.  The bed sheet was dirty and had a huge bloodstain right in the middle of the bed. I had to ask housekeeping to come and replace the bed sheets.
29648,1,"The waitress was great, the food was ok, and the hostess was terrible!  The manager and hostess sat 2 groups ahead of us that came in after us!  The manager gave an excuse that she can't sit too many people at once in one section.  There were only 2 in our party!  No true apology nor did they offer to make up the inconvenience.  I would never go back!!"

46862,4,"The owner is very very nice! We went here late last night all the way from henderson and he gave us a really good deal! They have the best guava ice cream ever! Vanilla macaron with guava ice cream was the bomb! The black bean ice cream was very delicious as well! The nutella banana with the cookies and cream waffle cone was a pretty good combination!. He can personalize any milkshake using any icecream flavor you like! The guava milkshake is so unique, it has that right amount of thickness and creaminess to it! The blackbean milktea was was also good if you like something that isnt too sweet! The green apple smoothie was also delish, sweet and jst right! Try this place, china town got nothing on this place. Id drive here again!"

21971,4,"My first time here was a move to get something in my stomach before heading to a lounge for the night. I opted for this casual quick stop over a heavily priced sit down restaurant elsewhere in the area. I'm glad I did! I have been back since then just to see if my thoughts on this joint were skewed by me just being hungry to the point where a boiled shoe would have been good. Nope, not at all. Don't let the line turn you away, it moves quickly"
44685,3,Total fun. Funner than a competitor that rhymes with sakasan.  \n\nThe line can be daunting.  Luckily I skipped all that with staff glist.  I paid. My girl didn't.  I didn't care I was prepared for that.\n\ni felt like: that ramp up on space mountain right before you drop. with all the lights and effects.  it was pretty cool.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you feel the energy.  It's people PARTYING!!  not just standing around waiting for the hot DJ to perform.\n\nPeople are dancing and drinking and having a blast. I met alot of tourists from other states.  It was cool. \n\nThe LED monitors were incredible. It really added to the experience.  The DJ was on point. I didn't catch his name.\n\nI really like the cirque de soleil flavor. Girls swinging from the ceiling.  Ribbon dancing.  Acrobatics.  it was awesome.  \n\nThe one thing that keeps me from giving them a flawless score is the crowd.  It's a good crowd for the most part but one particular culture dominates the ethnic spectrum. (not white).  And it made it hard to mingle and meet people.  I like a diverse crowd with equal ratios.  Preferable more girls than guys.\n\nI would definitely return.  I had a lot of fun here.
18392,3,"This is the place where my husband and I get drinks, peruse books, and play games.  It may not be funky or trendy, but it is open regularly (even on Sunday when I grade papers).  The people who work there are really nice.  If they don't have a book, they will offer to order it, and they have a pretty darn good game selection for a big bookstore.  I even got Pandemic there!  \n\nI find it enjoyable to see how many teachers I see!"
27525,2,"I came here with a couple of mates, I hadn't really heard too much about the castle so didn't really know too much of the history. It is situated around 3 miles south east of the city centre, which would take about an hour to get to if you walked from the centre or about 15 minutes if you get a bus.\n\nWhen me and a couple of mates came here, we found out that you had to pay to get in, but we weren't prepared to do this as we weren't that interested in seeing what was inside. Although it must be said that it did look pretty impressive from the outside.\n\nIf medieval history is your thing, then you may think it would be worth to have a little look around here, but as I'm not all that into medieval history, and there are more impressive castles around, I really do not feel the appeal of actually paying to come here and look inside in the future."
26987,0,"Completely rude and horrible customer service.\nI felt very uncomfortable and like I was a nuicance to the employees.\nI asked for a piece of cake at the bakery counter and the woman gave me the wrong piece. I was kind and patient and asked for a different piece. When the Jamaican lady, the bakery attendant, handed it to me I was looking at both and she demanded that I \""hurry up and pick one\"". 20 minutes later I am writing this review that I will either A) never shop there again or B) every time I go in there target her for customer service and keep her waiting on me for 10 slow excruciatingly annoying minutes while i compare cake slices. Still haven't decided."
17625,1,"Does anyone ever win their drawing? \n\nWhen walking into Mermaids you are offered some wannabe Mardi Gras beads and a ticket to win money in a drawing. Does anyone win? Probably not, but lets check out the inside. \n\nTo sum it up it is a pretty run down casino. My friend gets drinks without having to play a game, so I guess that is a benefit. God knows what disease he picked up for that perk, if you want to call that a perk at all. \n\nWould I go back, no. Will my friend probably drag me here another half dozen times, yes."
46157,1,"Came back to use my groupon; the service was friendly but I wouldn't say it was speedy by any means.  The cocktail I ordered was sickening sweet and I ended up trading with my fiance for his moscow mule.  The mule wasn't overly sweet but there were muddled cucumbers that got stuck in your teeth every time you took a sip.  I had the brie sandwich that seemed pretty small and uninteresing.  My fiance had a burger and that was really tasty.  The reason I took this place down a star is because we both ended up feeling sick the next day from the food.\n\nBottom line, after trying this place out twice, is that I will only be back for the hh wine special.  This place has just missed the mark on the food."
24069,4,"On days like today- everyone should get outside. After a fun week in Vegas my boyfriend and I took a nice little stroll in park- as expected it we were not the only ones enjoying the day. While it can be a little crowed its always clean and we feel safe. I guess it was a calming place for my boyfriend to ask me to move to Virginia with him (for his job). Of course I said yeas, but I'm going to miss our walk in the parks."
2605,0,"Horrible place.  Went in for my yearly exam and the doc ordered me some trials.  I came back a few wks later when they came in and I put them on and was looking cross eyed.  While I was in there for the appointment, the doc had me try on 3 different sets w/in a matter of 10 mins.  Left there w/ an OK pair but not the right ones.  They said they were going to order the next pair of trials for me as they didn't have them in stock.  Call 2 weeks later to see if they were in as I was told it only takes 7-10 business days, was told I would get a call back, never received one.  Called 2 days later and they said they weren't in yet but it would be w/in the next few days. Call couple of days later, still not in and then tell me there was a mix up on my order so they had to reorder.  I asked for another trial pair as the ones he gave me on my 2nd visit were old now.  I go pick them up and they give me two contacts that are for my right eye!  seriously people, how hard is it? I think I am going to get Lasik after this crap experience w/ them!  I do not recommend them!"
19807,4,"Great discounted price! They have a wide selection of Ray-Bans. I wished they had more D&G's though and a separate section for men. Sheryl was very patient with me. She knew the style I wanted, the moment I described to her the look I was going for. Got my new glasses in 1.5 hours."

Park around the corner.\n\n--Too bad for the awful service here! Maybe they need to switch to placing your order at the counter with a cashier and get rid of the food servers."
49311,2,"Food was mostly quite good, as expected at this price point.  Steaks and veal were tremendous, although brussel sprouts were overcooked. Service was very attentive. Ambiance was not so good: dark, no tablecloths, low but not romantic lighting, windowless and drab  -- all made the place feel unwelcoming."
18790,0,"I know that sometimes, the ratings on these kind of sites are low and people exaggerate. But Arcadia Del Sol fully deserves its one star rating. \n1. The water is always off. ALWAYS. It is either fully turned off or the hot water is off. It happens several times a month. They never actually fix the problem, they just band-aid it up and wait for it to happen again. For all of the money that Allison-Shelton makes off of this place, they don't put very much back into it.\n2. Which brings me to my second point. They just put a TON of money into painting to attract new residents instead of taking care of their current residents and fixing the existing problems (such as the water, a/c, etc.)\n3. They are SHADY!!!! I lived in an apartment where the a/c did not work (they finally admitted it after about a year of me complaining and they told me it was all in my head basically). They said the whole column of apartments did not work, and that they were not moving anyone into any of them. We switched apartments and literally a month later they moved someone into our apartment.\n4. They advertise a lot of features that are pretty much non-existent. They advertise 2 pools (always green and uncleaned), a gym (that was taken out years ago), a courtyard (that is covered in dog poop), and a lobby room for events (that they are currently using as storage).\n5. Everything around here is SO old and falling apart. The countertops are some old material from the 70s that if you get a drop of ANYTHING with color on it, it will be permanently stained (that's not an exaggeration). My faucets leak, my carpets are stained, the closet doors don't function (ie they sit there, they dont really open), etc.\n6. Lastly, the marijuana. They say they serve the drug users in the community with papers for fines and asking them to stop, etc. and the residents deny they use marijuana.... why not just evict them? Because the apartment complex only cares about the money.\n\nThis apartment complex has so much potential but unfortunately, the management is awful and I am so thrilled to be moving at the end of my lease."

6982,1,"Went here for lunch on a not-super-busy Thursday. After an exchange with the very confused waitress about nutmeg (my friend has allergies), I ordered an egg salad sandwich. When I got it, there was literally only a tablespoon of egg salad on the bread. It was mostly a lettuce sandwich. I would've said something to the waitress, but she had given us our check with our food and never came back to see how we were doing. Poor service, poor food."
34926,3,"Ah, Pollock. The memories. Most people who've stayed here did so as freshers although the uni does rent out the nicer blocks to tourists or people attending conferences at the on-site conference centre, St. Leonard's Hall.\n\nThe tourists only ever get put in Chancellor's Court or John Burnett House, as the others are pretty skanky breezeblock cells housed in ugly 1960s wannabe tower blocks, and also because these two are the most expensive. When the rahs go home for summer and aren't cluttering up the quad with their stupid huge hairdos and jack wills tracksuit bottoms, this place is pretty good. There are a few grassy areas for lounging on during the rare suny days, there's an on-site pub and there's also a little corner shop which is fairly well-stocked. \n\nJust don't eat in the JMCC canteen. They like to dress it up and call it a restaurant, but it will always be a canteen. And not a very good one at that."
21995,3,"The Skinny: \nAwesome sandwich joint open late with a self-proclaimed \""world famous\"" tagline that lives up to their hype!\n\nEnvironment:\nThis place was in one of the casinos so the environment is... well it's Vegas, what else do you want? They have some tables for seating, and since most people come and go fast, it isn't that hard to find seating.\n\nService:\nMostly service is consisted of the cashiers and the sandwich makers. There isn't much to say about the customer service for the tabling because that doesn't really matter here.\n\nFood:\nAmazing sandwich! I got the hot turkey sandwich because I wanted to try out the cranberry sauce and stuffing since one of my favorite sandwiches is the Bobbie at Capriotti's of Culver City. Man... the sandwich at Earl surpassed my past experiences with that kind of sandwich elsewhere! It was very balanced and did not sog up the bread, but it kept it moist at just the right amount. The balance kept the flavor in without an over dryness of bread. My friends got other hot sandwiches and it seemed everyone liked their sandwiches. Some came by again the next day!\n\nOverall: 4/5\nGood place for sandwiches, you should definitely try this place for a small bite when in Vegas."

33104,2,"The Tap House is a great place to grab a beer with friends. It has a good vibe, the servers are friendly, there are pool tables, a juke box and Kareoke. \n\nThe food at the Tap House is average. It is mostly typical bar fare. Much of the menu is fried and it tastes like fried food you can get anywhere. The rest of the menu offerings leave much to be desired.\n\nSupposedly, they have specials that are pretty good, including the Monte Cristo. People I went with usually went crazy over it."

11034,3,"Really can't complain. We booked this place frantically because there weren't any rooms available anywhere else during EDC weekend. \n\nThe people at the front desk are really attentive and helpful. The rooms are decent sized. It has a decent pool. They have an open bar during their happy hour which is nice. No premium liquors of course. The restaurant inside serves a complimentary custom order breakfast for guests with their room key. \n\nIf you're in dire need of a room in Vegas, this isn't a bad place to stay. Its not too far from the strip and there were plenty of parking spaces available. Its also very conveniently across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel if you need to gamble late night."
17839,3,"Sierra Gold is one of the best neighborhood bars.  They give me the VIP treatment every time we visit; a couple of the girls even remember my name.  Their food selection is fantastic.  When Steve, I think he's the bar manager, is there things do tend to run much more smoothly.  If you are a player, they really do take great care of you.\n\nLove the calamari & thin crust pizzas.  They offer the pizza @ 50% off for happy hour from 5-7.  Generous portion of nachos that is difficult to finish.  Good bloody marys - they have their own mix.  You would be surprised at how difficult it is to find good bloody marys around here.\n\nI always have much more fun at SG than I expected.  Good food, good service, & I frequently get lucky @ video poker here."

It's made with a delightful custard batter that can put a smile on anyone's face. To be frank, all of their food is great. The service is stellar too!! You see a lot of the same people. During the week, they have a great breakfast special. There is no reason to come eat here!!"
3976,4,"Now, I am very hesitant to give a dentist 5 stars.  I mean if I was rating dentists as a whole, I would give them negative stars.  I have gone to a *lot* of dentists in my day and would never have considered giving one above 3 stars.  Then, I met Dr. Wyatt.  \n\nFirst, his helpers are super helpful and friendly.  They are nice and sometimes when they ask a question, they actually take the tools out of your mouth for you to answer!\n\nSecond, Dr. Wyatt himself follows suit and is nice.  Even when you have issues he's nice about it.  He doesn't lecture or raise his voice or even seem angry that you don't do something, like oh floss all the time...  He truly seems like he wants you to have a happy, healthy smile, not like he is frustrated with your behavior.\n\nLastly, his office is called \""Reel Dental\"" and they have a movie theme.  Though somewhat cheesy, it's nice to have movies on in the waiting room and such.  Rumor has it that when you go in for long dental work, which I never have, you can watch a movie while it's done!  Anything to take your mind of the fact you're in a dentist chair is great.\n\nOh, and for the ladies, he's quite easy on the eyes to look at while being worked on!"

I suspect the bulk of them were cleverly submitted by Cosmo's PR firm.  \n\nThe rooms run entirely through the television set, from lighting to temperature, yet the remote batteries were spent.

We finally resorted to moving bulbs around so the loo wouldn't be in utter darkness. \n\nI give this hotel one star not for any of the above but for the audacity to charge our room $68.00 for the mini-bar, which we didn't use. Audacity for their flippant attitude about an accounting error they claim is common. We were told that just opening the fridge, which we used for our own goods, triggers a charge.  We think it's a sick and twisted profit center. Checking in was a pain and checking out even more difficult."
4630,4,"I honestly never thought it was possible for a gas station to get 5/5 stars. I really didn't, but this place is great. \n\nThe staff here is super friendly...every time you walk in you're greeted with a \""hello\"" or some other salutation. In addition to everyone just being nice, the store is oddly clean, INCLUDING THE BATHROOM! I have never been into a cleaner gas station bathroom...EVER! I always stop into this gas station on my way home from Henderson to Los Angeles, and I will continue to do so.\n\nIf you are driving down St. Rose and need to fill up, grab a drink, or just \""walk the dog\"", this is definitely the place to stop!"
41106,4,"I've only had the Pad Thai so far, but it was excellent. They apparently have a Thai chef, so most the dishes have a Southeast Asian flair--which I love.\n\nI've heard that the Korean burritos are also excellent--fresh ingredients, tasty sauce.\n\nThe owner is wonderful and very eager to please the customers."
35188,0,"Worst service ever!  Came in at 9:20pm and as soon as we walked in the manager told us take out only!  I asked why when it clearly states on the door they don't close until 10:00.  He told me it's because he wanted to get out early.  WHAT THE FUCK?!?  I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.  So rude.  He even chuckled as he said it.  Going to call the owner tomorrow, but honestly if he hired someone like this to manage his restaurant I'd be surprised if he even cared."
19087,2,"The service was fast and friendly.  The restaurant was clean.  I had the Italian sandwich; I can't remember it's menu name, but it was the one with Italian meats, seasonings, and oil and vinegar.  I wish I would've loved it, but to me, it was just OK.  Perhaps it was because I got it to go and had to wait 20 minutes before digging in?  The price was reasonable at about $5 for the small sandwich.  The location is not near to where I work or live, so it won't become my go-to deli, but I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another try in the future."
23518,3,"We go here once every few months.  The beer is great and they have a good selection.  The decor seems to struggle to find itself, but if the food is really good, who cares what it looks like.  They have added table service, which was not so great, but the beer was good, so......  Always get the cod fish and chips.  It all seems to cost more than it should, but I don't mind if I am supporting a local business.  The only thing I will remember is to face away from the kitchen space, because you can see everything they are doing in there, it's a bit unnerving and I don't care for having to ask for a key to the restroom."
17653,4,The most amazing experience EVER! I decided to take my boyfriend on a helicopter ride over the Vegas strip at night for his 30th birthday. A limo picked us up at our hotel and then we were the last people to ride for the night. The limo ride and helicopter ride over the Vegas strip at night was the best experience ever!
2775,0,"I went this morning with my nana for breakfast. We were seated promptly. I noticed right away the walls were dirty and there was hair on the table top. The waitress was slow to take our order. They weren't busy. She took our order and a server brought out our food. They forgot our requested butter and catchup as well as cream for coffee. The waitress never stopped back at the table to check on us but stopped at the table next to us to ask them how they were. I got the spinach, mushroom and bacon omelet. The hash-browns were yummy, but the omelet tasted like it was cooked in old grease and I only ate 2 bites of it. I was dismayed to see they only serve one piece of toast with breakfast. It was dry and hardly buttered. Every restaurant I have ever been to serves 2 pieces of toast. Nana ordered the Beggars Omelet and loved it. However, both she and I felt our food was warm Like it had sat around for a while. We spoke with the manager before we left and voiced our concerns. Maybe it was a bad day & a bad waitress, but all in all, I will never go back here for food. This was at the Greenfield & Broadway location."
25904,1,"Best breakfast place in the area, hands down. Nothing fancy, but they do standard breakfast stuff properly and as expected. There's a bit of a line Saturday and Sunday morning, but it moves quickly.\n\nThey also do a decent lunch, I recommend the Georgia Salad.\n\nUPDATE: I'm less fond of this place -- they screwed up my eggs benny the last couple times to the point of uneatable. I don't go here anymore."
3274,1,"This establishment is walking distance from my home, my husband and I are also very committed to supporting the local economy, and therefore we wanted to purchase our bike from a bike shop as opposed to a chain store- even though her bikes cost on average $75-100 more for the same brand (Sports Authority at TMP has the same brand of Electra bikes for less, for example).\n\nThe owner Crystal was very kind and helpful in the research process, and let us ride the different bikes out back. The beach cruisers hurt my knees and so she directed us to a \""Giant\"" brand bike where the pedals were a little farther back. I was still unsure and she recommended I try riding it longer to see. So I purchased the bike and a basket, and took it home and rode it around a little bit. The basket clinks against the bike rod (it doesn't fit correctly with the shape of the bike), and the bike still hurts my knees so we went back two days later to see about a trade-in or return, and she told us all sales were final. \n\nI expressed to her that it is bad business to have an \""all sales final\"" without putting up signage, and also without even telling the customer at the time of purchase. I find this to be manipulative and dishonest. I did notice that the receipt she gave me after purchase did say \""all sales final\"" on the top, however I did not get this until AFTER the purchase. \n\nSo now I am stuck with a bike that hurts my knees, cost $375, plus a $35 basket that does not fit. In the future unfortunately, because of this unsavory experience, I will be purchasing all future bikes from mega retailers."
27978,4,I am there at least twice a year and I go there everytime and the staff are really friendly thats what we need these!! KEEP IT UP!!!!!
24357,1,"Before I get into my review, I just want to preface that this rating is for happy hour.\n\nHappy hour is from 4-7p all day errrday, which is pretty convenient.\n\nI ordered the smoked salmon, fish tacos, ahi poke, crab bisque soup, chick lollipop, and the crab cake.  I had the sangria and cantaloupe martini to drink.\n\nThe food was just ok.  I didn't fall in love with any of the dishes we had, and thought that it was still too pricey for what it was.  I can't imagine paying full price for any of those dishes.\n\nThe lollipop chicken was dry, sauce was ok, mango salad it came with was good.\nAhi poke and smoked salmon dishes were ok, but I didn't like the chips they came with.  Plantain chips would've been a better choice to serve with.  I thought the fish tacos lacked seasoning, flavor, sauce;  all I tasted was the flour tortilla.  Crab cake had wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much sweet chili sauce.  It over powered the crab cake, which was too salty anyway.  Lastly, the crab bisque!  Disgusting.  I tried this cause it seemed to be a favorite dish on yelp reviews.  It was really difficult for me to eat because they went wayyyyy to heavy on the cream.  I really felt like puking after.  I would not recommend this dish.  The drinks were ok.  Sangria wasn't really a sangria.  No fruit, just cheap red wine mixed with fruit juice and water I suppose.  Cantaloupe martini was good, but way to sweet.  I think they should've held back on some of the melon liqueur.  Probably would've tasted better if they used real cantaloupe juice.\n\nService was friendly, but slightly inattentive.  No big deal cause he had the whole bar to take care of, plus the tables.  Didn't bring us the bread in the beginning, but did offer it half way through the meal.  I told him i'd like some, but he never brought it.  Asked for it after our meal was done, cause I wanted to taste the apple butter.  Had to flag someone else down for our check.\n\nOverall, I will probably not come back because I didn't care for the food we had.  I tried to sample as much as I could from the HH and appetizer list.  Based on what I had and the price, there are other restaurants in Vegas I'd rather spend my money on.  That's it."
14591,1,"I can't possibly understand how this has gotten such high reviews. The food was extremely mediocre. Lots of items were bland. I wasn't impressed by the dishes at all. Very typical dishes for a crappy buffet (i.e. pancakes, eggs benedict, etc.)  I was there for brunch and lunch. The only thing I enjoyed was the prosciutto, but even that was not quality. \nAnd, the worst part is that NOTHING I ate was hot. I don't understand how I place like the Wynn, as pricey as it is, can't figure out how to keep their buffet food warm. (I've been to buffets that have been able to figure this out, and they're a lot cheaper)"
3134,0,Unbelievably uninspiring breakfast. Chilaquiles was cold so I got the biscuits and gravy. Dry biscuits and gravy under seasoned and lacking flavor. I have never posted a review on yelp but this meal was so bad I felt I had to. Nothing original on the breakfast menu..will not return.
47068,0,Employees are unhelpful and very rude. Took me 2 minutes in this location to realize that I need to stay with Verizon. I would\nNot reccomend this location to anyone!!!!!!
11569,3,"First off, do not go to the address listed for these reviews.  I am guessing that folks just started posting here, and never stopped.  The correct location is actually at the 1700 block.  This place , the 1500 block, is where the wholesale market for restaurants and grocery stores is.  Pretty obvious, unless you are not from the area, in which case you will be wondering \""Where the $%$# is Wholey's ?\"" if you go to 1501 Penn Ave.\n\nBought the jumbo crab legs here yesterday.  At 25 bucks a pound for the jumbos, definitely not cheap, but celebrating a new job and at the same time starting a two week Cisco class.\n\nAnyways...  I love crab.  I remember first buying the snow crab in 1985, when you could buy large snow crab legs that rivalled the size of todays king crab legs for $2.79 a pound.  Kind of like you used to be able to get skirt steak for a buck a pound before people discovered how delicious skirt steak is.\n\nThe regular king crab was $18.00 per lb.  The jumbo are $25.00 per lb.  I said what the heck, and got three pounds of the jumbos.  Which came out to six legs.  \n\nFirst big plus, they are very \""clean\"".  Don't have big chunks of ice crusted on them, which forces you to pay $25.00 a pound for water.\n\nSecond, at that price, I have zero problem having the person at the counter dig down in the display to get exactly what I want.  And while other folks may have had bad experiences, I have never had a surly counter person, they never have any problem getting what I want.  But like I said, for the price these things cost, they better not have a problem with digging out the ones I want.\n\nAnd last, they were very good looking.  No \""odd' coloration or look.  \n\nWhen I got these things home, I only steamed two of them.  Which was a very healthy sized meal.  And they were the sweetest and best tasting I had ever had.  Just ate them with butter.\n\nToday, I am just going to thaw and heat one of them, then chop up the meat and have it over iceberg lettuce with FRESH MADE Ranch dressing.  I love getting Hidden valley Ranch, mixing it with just a pint of sour cream, and dressing iceberg and king crab meat with it.  One of my favorite, and most likelt easiest, meals.\n\nAnd!!!  Wholey's is a full serve grocery store.  They have a full meat department, veggies, not as big as a Giant Eagle or a Wal-Mart, but definitely better than either place.  \n\nSo DON'T think of Wholey's as just a place for seafood.  You can get your whole party stocked from here.\n\nNow, the bad things.  They only have five (5!?!?!) cash registers.  Also, they sell sushi, but it is so popular, unless you want to stand there for half an hour, don't get the sushi unless you happen to walk in, and no one is standing in line.  In which case, get the sushi.  It is pretty good, suprsingly so."
2406,2,"I've only been to this Ra once or twice, but I think the price is overestimated here.  Maybe people are having too much Sake.  The service is decent, ambiance is very faux Japanese-American deal.  Sushi is pretty good and if you go during happy hour it's a steal.  Sake and Kirin is like 3 or 4 bucks and you can get a thing of Sake for $1.  They have a nice patio sitting area to people watch. Great place if you want to catch a friend for lunch or do dinner and a movie."
18740,0,"I suggest paying very close attention to the prices. I went there 8/14/2011 and ordered a stromboli and small drink, when they rang it up he rang up $1 something twice and then $8.50 for the stromboli bringing the total on the register to $12 and some change. When I pointed out that the menu board said that the stromboli is only $7.50 he huffed and said \""fine I'll just make it smaller\"" at that point I turned and wallked out.\n\nBeing only a block from ASU student dorms I wouldn't be surprised if preoccupied students aren't being cheated on a regular basis there."
18962,4,My favorite neighborhood grocery store! Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.\n\nI also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for. \n\nMuch more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.
31975,1,"After reading all of these reviews, I was really excited for my Thai Noodles experience.  \nWe ordered takeout, I got pad thai and the boy got curry.  We also got tofu eggrolls and spring rolls.\nThe standout item was the eggrolls...\nThe pad thai was nothing special, I have definately had better in Madison and the curry was nothing to write home about either... It was very watery and lacking any flavor... there was no standout spice or curry flavor and the pad thai was very sticky and seemed over cooked."
17322,3,"wonderful sammiches~\n\nburned my tongue but at least I wasnt hungry anymore\n\nwhat did I eat? I dont really remember...all I know is that there was chicken and cheese and red bell peppers.\n\nseats were a bit to strange to sit in, and I like the fact how it was actually pretty quiet, away from the hustle bustle of Vegas. Luckily there was no line.\n\nSo Service was nice, with smiles and pretty quick with the food"
41654,1,When you first walk in it looks like you're about to have a great experience. However I was highly disappointed. First of all they UNSANITIZED tools on me. I was charged for a glitter that I didn't even want AND my gel nail polish chipped the next morning!!! I was not happy to pay $60 for a gel mani and a regular pedicure that didn't even last 24 hours. The one positive thing I can say is that they were extremely friendly.
17893,3,We found this resteraunt thank you to all of you yelpers!! My BF took me for my Bday and we loved it! The food was sooooo good and we were given a cozy little romantic booth. We also gave them a bday cake that they placed candles on and the singer came out with the waitress and sang to me over his microphone. Sounds embarressing but thankfully because of the way the cozy little booth was it was all good. The bathroom was nice and clean. The prices were really good and like I said the food tasted amazing. My only issue was the music was VERY loud so if your looking for a place to just sit and chat. This won't be the right venue for you!
224,3,"Very nice hotel. First time staying here. Stayed for three nights. Room was on the 9th floor.\n\nHotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was huge! I could have fit 40 or so people in my room if I had to.\n\nCons:\n- Older CRT-based, analog style TVs in the room. C'mon! Where is the large flat panel HD screens with HD programming?\n- TV service is satellite based. Lots of interference and loss of signal during my stay due to thunderstorms. Need Verizon FIOS here.\n- In order to unlock the door to the room - you have to grasp the door handle and pull the door toward you while the card for the door lock is inserted and wait for the light on the lock to turn green\n- Room was very stuffy when I arrived. It took about 6 hours for the room to cool off. Once it cooled off though - it was fine.\n\nPros\n- Beds were comfy - still not as firm as I would prefer - but better than some of the places I've stayed recently.\n- Pillows were substantial. I hate it when you get pillows that flatten out to the thinness of a pizza box the moment your head hits the pillow.\n- Hotel staff are friendly and looking to make your stay as nice as possible\n- The two dragons guarding the entrance to the hotel - very cool looking!\n- Club Lounge is nice touch - got some appetizers to eat and a few cold beverages to take back to my room and store in the fridge for later.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- If you are staying here - please note the hotel does not have a convenience store - they have a very limited number of items for sale down by the front desk. If you are in need of toiletries, beverages, snacks and other items - there is a 7-Eleven down the street - and a CVS and a Rite Aid an additional block or so further - BUT - be forewarned - none of these three options stays open very late. \n\n7-Eleven (601 Penn Avenue)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/7-eleven-pittsburgh-4\n\nRite Aid (519 Penn Avenue)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/rite-aid-pittsburgh-17\n\nIf it's after 10:00 pm - all of these places will be closed. You will have to walk a bit farther to find the next 7-Eleven and a Clarks that stays open later - but your choices/selections will be severely limited product-wise.\n\n7-Eleven (643 Liberty Avenue)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/7-eleven-pittsburgh-5\n\n- There are lots of restaurants on 6th near the hotel. While I have not tried them all - the ones I enjoyed the most were: Six Penn, Indian Spices, and The Bridge (actually in the hotel).\n\nSix Penn\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/six-penn-kitchen-pittsburgh\n\nIndian Spices\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/indian-spices-pittsburgh\n\nThe Bridge\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bridge-bar-pittsburgh\n\n- There is a Starbucks just down the street too for those that need to get their caffeine buzz on!\n\nStarbucks\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-coffee-pittsburgh-4"
47864,0,"Nice looking place but it's servers are very consistent with FORGETTING our orders. I can understand if they forgot to put one order in, but multiple times? After ordering dessert, I felt uneasy and regurgitated what I have eaten.. It must have been the baked salmon. I'm never coming back here again. If I could give this place a negative star, I would."
46799,3,"Overall pretty decent.  While the pricing is good, the portioning is commensurate with that pricing.  Overall it was pretty good, but since the portions were a little on the small side, you were left wanting.  The ribeye looked like a the same size as you would get with steak and eggs, and the file was maybe 5 or 6 oz.  The bar looks worthwhile and they happy hour specials looked to be of good value."
20140,0,"After coming here every once in a while, we were horribly disappointed in the poor service, due to lack of employees. Slow service, very long wait for anything, from sake to food. Tiny, skinny rolls were an embarassment. After waiting 40 minutes, we finally received something, the yakisoba was cold, the chicken was heavily overcooked to being so dry, it felt like cardboard. We sent the dish back, at the point the appetite is dead and you just want to pay and go. Never again, what has happened to the place?"
3659,3,"I live nearby and really like this place. They make their bagels fresh every morning and they make their own cream cheese. I like my everything bagel with the nova cream cheese. Yummy!  They get busy on the weekends very early and once they're out of something, they're out. They always have a lot of everything but I've been there later in the morning on a Saturday and they were out of a certain kind of bagel.  Sooooo good!!!"
48334,4,Cloud 9 is the best hookah spot. Great DJs. Great staff. Great crowd over all. Yeah they might not serve alcohol  but they do have a xbox one that you can play with while smoking the best flavors in town!
33574,0,"So, I feel like a complete idiot for getting sucked in by Winder Farms a second time. Too many extra fees, you have to babysit the delivery man and accounting for credits due, overpriced milk, bread and produce that never lasts until the expiration date, and of course the small print in the contract that requires 40 deliveries before cancellation or a $50+ cancellation fee. It doesn't seem like a big deal until you realize what a waste of money it all is and find yourself skipping every delivery. You are better off buying your milk and bread at Trader Joes or Fresh & Easy and your produce at the farmers' market."
42435,4,"I just bought a house and needed my doors re-locked.  Called around 9:30 and Toby was there by 1:00pm.  He was courteous, professional and knowledgeable.  Would definitely recommend him to anyone needing a great locksmith.\nThanks!"
8785,2,"Pretty good hot dogs. I've been here a few times and the boston dog has a bit of a sweet and savory taste to it. The mac n cheese in the mac n cheese dog is very bland tasing though, I ended up scooping it off of my hot dog. The prices are pretty high too. The bread is definitely the best thing here.\nThey've also been closed at random times when they should've been open too... Out of the ten times I've tried to go here in the last month or so they were only open three times for some reason..."
36625,0,"Bought a set of medium priced ear protection, used them 5 times \nHad the original packing, and store receipt dated the end of August. 2013\nThe set has an amplifier and it stopped working.

So because they sold some piece of crap and realized that they were....now that one is coming back with all packaging and receipt.... good luck to you and try to find the company made in China by yourself.\nThat is the last time I will be shopping in Lock n' Load"
25370,1,"Came to montreal hearing that bagels, smoked meats and poutine are all the rage here.  Ordered the salmon lox bagel and a half dozen onion bagels.\n\nTo be honest, I couldnt see what all the hype was about.  Yes i can tell the difference between the montreal bagel and a regular new york bagel but it doesnt warrant all the hype.  The only difference is that montreal bagels are chewier and taste more like pretzels.\n\nNot overly impressed.  Personally not worth the walk in -10 degree weather."
22195,0,"This is one of the worst Burlesque shows (if that's what you call it!)  my friends and I have ever seen. \n\nIt doesn't fit in the Burlesque theme at all, the choreography coach needs to get these ladies on the same page, the music and screen play is way too much, dancers are very cheesy and short.  \n\nThe comedian in the middle of the show said one funny joke!  The crowd said it all there was no laughter for the comedian and very little clapping for the dancers.  One guy actually left the show and another fell asleep!!!!\n\nThe ladies are not very attractive unless you are into super skinny, no boobs kind of dancers.  They pulled a gentleman on stage towards the end and were dancing for him but, they didn't even touch him it was super cheezy and don't let the reviews of the champange glass fool you!  \n\nWe also ordered a soda and a juice, of course to add our own liqour and the wanted $12 for the drinks.\n\nThis show wasn't even worth the half price that we paid for it!!! Let anyone you know going to Vegas NOT to waste their money on this show or their time."
47217,0,Wonton soup is terrible. I don't know what I expected for mall food but yuck. Broth tasted gamey and the wontons themself just looked bad. Couldn't even bring myself to try one.
35442,1,"Golf course is my favorite in the east valley. They have a great deal call \""9 and Dine\"" 9 holes of golf and dinner at the restaurant.  Wednesday is prime rib night- I highly recommend!  I play here 2-3 times a month and would have given it a 5 stars but the starter today was the most unprofessional person I met!  Our tee time was at 3:26 and he was not around so we headed to the White course at 3:35.  When we were about to putt the starter drives up and yells at us saying we got in front of a single coming off the Blue course.  Ridiculous that after waiting for 10 mins without no starter, a starter then drives all the way to the green to yell at us for not checking in.  People like this really ruins your golf experience and makes a troon golf course look bad!"
20935,2,Service was good. Clam chowders are delicious but oysters were a let down. They were different sizes and flavors. I also wouldn't order the crab legs.  They were pretty average. There is a dish (called roasted crab with sauce?) that is very good.  I would recommend that and the chowders.
47815,2,"My first trip warrants a return.  I'll be bringing lunch for coworkers next time.\n\nI picked up the brisket sandwich entree.  The meat was tender, on a good bun, and complemented well by the spicy sauce (a tasty \""Wisconsin spicy\"" vinegar sauce).  \n\nThe baked beans were savory, and surprisingly spicy.  The beans were excellent (still a bit firm), and there was plenty of pork in the mix.\n\nI opted for the mayo-based coleslaw, which was decent.\n\nPlan on getting takeout, as seating is limited to twelve stools (three tables for two along the windows, two counters with three stools each along the walls)."

14271,3,"The \""petite\"" lobster corn dogs didn't live up to the hype, but I wasn't disappointed with Vino Lounge at Tapino.  They were just as described and while I can't whole-heartedly recommend them, they were quite the novelty and I'm happy I tried them.  Petite was an accurate description as well, and this might as well go for the other tapas on the 5-5-5 menu.  Presentation is paramount here, with the corndogs displayed upright on a fancy wooden tray and the chocolate debauchery dessert laid out across a large plate with precision.\n\nLet's face it, their happy hour menu is a highlight here for sure and its availability on weekends is a major plus.  The cabana style patio beckons you with a South Beach Miami flavor, that is, if a King Kong IKEA showroom swallowed Ocean Drive.  Yep.  Those same white slipcover couches decorate the patio, which isn't a bad move considering the wine accidents to be had here.\n\nOur server handled our large party very well, but early on the hostess/servers wouldn't let us move tables or seats together when there was clearly room and the ability to do so.  \n\nLike others have said, it's not a place to go if you're really hungry, but it's great if you're fine noshing on ambitious and creative appetizers such as duck confit tostadas or beef carpaccio with garlic aioli and fried capers.  The pomme frites were soggier than they should have been but the seasoning was right on. \n\nThe wine here was terrific.  I quaffed on a French syrah and sipped my friend's sauvignon blanc, and both were delicious selections for the measly $5.  The chocolate debauchery dessert is a must if you have the room to do it. Overall, Tapino is really a great wine bar and worth the drive to Scottsdale.  I am looking forward to the next visit."
10360,4,Best Pizza I've had so far in my 29 years of existence! lol.. it has moved over to MGM grand for those that don't know
10655,0,Terribly long wait. It's like they didn't know that anyone was coming to Las Vegas today. They seemed to have more employees than people waiting in line as they were doing a shift change that took about 1 hour.  Someone else commented that it was like the Post Office and they were exactly right.  They just don't give a damn.  Rent somewhere else no matter how much it costs!
9492,0,what a bunch of losers went in too sell some silver .999 and they did not want it and i also had a 2010 green bay packers team signed Superbowl football with all paperwork and they said they don't buy sports memorabilia   its call gold and silver?  and dint want silver wtf  i have seen on there fake show them buying these types of items   and the tool at the pawn counter  acted like it was such a bother to look at my items  what i joke   sold my silver and football at a real pawn shop for  $4500
30865,1,"Based on the reviews we wanted to check it out. Being from Brooklyn and knowing what great pizza really is,  I wanted to see for myself.\nIt's a counter order place which is fine for just a casual slice before a movie but not any ambience for dinner. Had couple of different slices, one Sicilian and one regular.  Nothing special on either front.  Not bad but not the texture and experience people were raving about.\nNot going out of my way to go back unless maybe before a movie."
7030,1,I like Miracle Mile Better... We had 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks 28.00 ... Who charges 2.18 for a drink... They were cheap on the BBO...
31945,1,"Service was okay. Eh, the pizza is well... a little grim. Ordered the pepperoni and sausage pizza. The meat tasted weird. Sauce was okay. I spent $38 for a lousy pizza and a few drinks. \n\nNothing special about this place. No reason to return. \n\nI've had better."
45459,3,Maybe it was because we were starving but I highly doubt it. This place is quite empty but the food was really good! It is served family style. I HIGHLY recommend the garlic noodles and the Stir Fry Chicken with Eggplant and Basil. I am dreaming of that plate currently. Best I've had hands down! Chicken Fried Rice was good -- not too greasy and flavorful.
8004,1,My husband and I ate here with his parents Saturday.  We arrived at 5:45 for a 6:00 dinner reservation.  The restaurant was half empty when we placed our order.  It took 55 minutes and two requests to our waitress to get our first course.  It took another 30 for our main.  I complained to the waitress and the general manager.  Both were unapologetic stating there was nothing they could do as it was the first night of restaurant week.  Restaurant week means a trimmed down menu and I assume is meant to attract new customers.  There are too many other great restaurants in the area to give Cowboy Ciao a second chance with such an unapologetic attitude.
44182,3,"I was able to walk in SUPER last minute before my vacation for the holidays and got both my pedicure and full set.  All employees were extremely friendly, quality of my nails turned out beautiful, and the salon was very clean!  Love, love, LOVE the style of the office and felt comfortable knowing there was security monitoring the parking lot late at night.  I would definitely recommend Naughty Nails to any of my friends or family members. =)\n\n~Mae"
40434,3,"Went back two more times and tried their Chicken Katsu Bento, Hawaiian Shrimp and Kal Bee Bento. \n\nI think my favorites are Chicken Katsu and Kalbee so far. The portion of food you get for the price definitely won't leave you hungry. I actually had to eat my bento in phases so I can finish everything.\n\nI love the fact that the whole family are working there from ordering to making your food. A really nice and friendly place to relax and enjoy affordable good Korean food.\n\nCan't wait for them to extend their hours and add more Korean dished on their menu."
20474,4,"I would like to share my experience at Discount Tires on W Azure, got the best customer service from the time I pulled up up in my car from the time I left. It took them 30 minutes to get me back on the road, and I got a \""GREAT DEAL\"" on my tires, feel like I am in a new car, I will recommend this location, great customer service, Thanks Rob your the best."
48718,3,"We have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this  new restaurant.  We went on the second night it was open and we were very pleased!  Service, chips and salsa, food, and drinks were very good!  They have done a wonderful job with the remodel of the interior.  Nice to have another choice in  this area to enjoy - a nice complement to our other excellent Mexican restaurants!"
38872,3,"Just had coffee (espresso). I have been there about 6 times now. Friendly, helpful staff. Their expresso is much better that most. I don't order by name as some places do similar drinks differently. I order by description. My drink is 2 shots of expresso in a tall cup not the short one. With one inch of foam. Call it what you want. I call it two shots of expresso in a tall cup with an inch of foam. If the espresso is good you don't need the foam. Theirs is good enough to drink with out the foam. I have found only 4 places that I can drink without the foam. \n\nGive them a try if you are downtown. They will treat you right and you will get the drink you ordered. \n\nENJOY"
12046,2,"I would first like to say, this place did not match the \""hip/grunge\"" neighborhood that it is a part of, it is far more commercial in style and design.  \nNOW, that being said, if you like good food, a nice inviting place, and beer, GO HERE!\nI had the Renee's burger.  It one of a few burgers that are named after the owner's daughters.  It was quite good.  The meat is LOVELY, well seasoned, you could tell.\nI had the Framboise beer.  Its a favorite of mine, and often hard to fine on-tap.  Its a French raspberry beer.  If you aren't a regular beer drinker, its a great one to try."
11228,3,Love the wings at this place they are cooked in the pizza oven . Super crispy .love their breakfast specials For lunch get the get the taco basket !! Service is always good . Food portions are great . Friendly wait staff and bartenders
46266,3,"Very happy that they opened this location. Very good deal for AYCE $7.99..but if you can't do the buffet, you can order the 2-item combo for $4.99! For rice or pancit w/ 2 items..you can even do a \""split\"" and do half-rice/half-pancit. My only advice is if you plan to eat here, don't come too close to closing time as the food choices might not be as plentiful. Seating can be an issue as others have noted, but can't really blame them if everyone wants to grub on good filipino food~~FILIPINOS love a good deal!\nOverall, this is definitely a great place to get some filipino grub."
9750,0,"first off, i would like to say I really like my PCP, Susan Schuder. she seems to really care and i trust her. the praise stops there. i went in to see her yesterday for some pain, swelling and grinding in my wrist. she gave me a brace, sent me for xrays and said she would send a referral letter to Steinberg diagnostics right away bc i need an MRI. She told me to call the following morning to make an appt for my MRI. I was on the phone twice with Steinberg and twice with SMA between 7 and 10 am bc the referral letter still hadn't gone through and I was unable to make an appt without knowing what kind of MRI i needed. when I explained to the guy that answered at SMA at 10 am that my Dr. hadn't sent the referral  and I wanted to check on the status of it, he snottily told me Susan Schuder was not a doctor, she is an APN, and then proceeded to tell me it can take 5-7 days for a referral to go through. that's fine, but first of all, i don't care about her title, stick to the point, and second of all, she was the one that told me to call the following morning to make my appt! it didn't just make this s**t up, and I don't appreciate being talked to like i'm an idiot."
11463,4,"We were in for a treat.Piero was there and he did the honors!!!The friend who invited\nme has known Piero ever since he came to LasVegas. I had veal scalipini, tossed salad.,and potates lyonnise(Sp). Ugo had Orange roughy, schrimp scampi, Caesars salad. We split a plate of fried ocra, complements of Don Pierio.It makes a great\nappetizer. Our food was exceptional and done to a turn. Signore Piero made the rounds and presented himself to each table. As of this writing, Piero is the ambience. \nChloe needs to invest in some chianti bottles, waiters with old school white /black\nuniforms, and a mustache pete stuck in the corner with  a red checkered bib( hung\nfrom his collar) to keep Piero's dyno  veal parmesan from stainin' duh corbat.\nI don't remember the pricing. Prices were printed on the menu. So how bad\ncan they be? I'm going back regardless of pricing.  I will say finding a SPECTACULAR Italian ristorante like this,sandwiched between a \""craft\"" store and Art's Bail Bonds,\nis the kind of juxtaposition I can live with. Molto beni."
43524,0,The tacos are terrible. The shells are stale and the lack of filling that is put into the tacos makes them more of just a stale shell taco.  Customer service is a nightmare!
43833,1,"Skip & go to Wicked Spoon or Studio B Buffet. If you're into desserts then by all means, go to Bacchanal BUT if you want good, tasty & hot food - then don't go here. I was disappointed. Food was lukewarm & mind you, I got it from the tray that was just refilled. Crab legs were dumped in hot water but that didn't do it for me. Imagine cold crab legs dumped quickly in hot water... what do you get? Lukewarm crab outside with cold crabmeat."
23722,0,This location is awful. They changed names and nothing actually changed besides that. Food isn't very good. Dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions. So many better places to choose from. Won't be going back.
21264,3,"Went here while visiting my family in Feb...this place is great. They are a bar with bar food, but they do gluten free and Vegan if you want it. The wait staff is super friendly and will even swap pictures of their puppies with you. The place is dog friendly, like bowls of water on the outdoor patio and even dog treats."
49588,0,I was so excited to go to this place especially for their 40 cent wing night. What a let down!
29135,4,"I've been to Postino Central about five times in the last two months.  The atmosphere is a cute little restaurant with large tables for groups and outdoor seating as well. I have gone with small groups of 3-4 and larger groups of 9+, and we are seated within a reasonable amount of time. The outdoor seating can get a bit warm in hotter months, though.  The parking is complimentary (complimentary + tip, actually), so make sure you have some cash on hand, or the Light Rail is just about a block away or less. \n\nThe wine selection is nice, although I haven't seen a Chianti on the menu. They also carry hard-to-find beers, such as my favorite, Duval and Raspberry Framboise.  The bruschetta is delicious, and there are interesting choices, such as white bean/tomato/basil and fig/apple/cheese, quite tasty!\n\nUpdate: Since I wrote this, about 4-5 trips later, again, wow, I'm so impressed with this place. In October, a friend came to visit and we had a party of 15 on a Saturday night. I made reservations, but they had the table ready to go by 6:55 pm and didn't mind that just three of us sat down while waiting for the others. The servers were quite attentive, and I've never had to wait. I recently brought my mom last week, and she described the food as \""delicious,\"" and today took part in the 3-5pm $5 happy hour, delish!  Another perk - it's so chill. I noticed many people wearing jeans or shorts at Postino today, yet some people dress up.\n\nThe only thing that can be annoying - if you can't find parking or if the valets are done for the day, be careful about where you park in the street. I've had friends who got tickets."
33880,4,My hubby n I dined in tonight. Got a pizza. It was delicious! The prices are good & the staff is friendly. Extra points for this location being so convenient to where live!
49146,3,"I stopped in today for lunch. The staff were nice, service was fast. The food would be what I'd consider a restaurant style bbq. The ribs tasted like they were smoked and dry rubbed, pretty good even though im more a fan of a more vinegary and fatty rib. The cornbread was ok. The hot sauce was a little over powering, not from heat..it just didn't leave any room for the flavor of the meat. Overall good experience but the place was empty...so if you want a bbq place in the South Side..you should probably stop in so they keep their lunch hours."
36136,1,"Went to our first show last night. Let me begin by saying the talent was incredible, we did not stop laughing the entire time. Food and drinks on the other hand? The WORST. I ordered the premium Moscow Mule and it was incredibly weak and barely carbonated. It tasted as if it was watered down. My friend ordered a raspberry mojito and same story. The mint and raspberries weren't muddled and there was more soda water than necessary, making the drink flavorless. 3 in our group ordered makers mark on the rocks... Those were fine, although it's pretty difficult to screw that drink up. In addition to a cocktail I ordered a water and filtered/tap water is unavailable. You are forced to pay $4 for still Voss- no charge for ice tho HAHA what a joke... Moving on to the food: my dad ordered the gumbo, it was okay but nothing special. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and the lettuce was soggy. The chicken was cold in the center and warm toward the edges... Yuck. My friend had mozzarella sticks and we didn't expect them to be handmade but if they had actually been cooked through- not still cold in the middle-it would have been nice. Another friend had the sliders... Soggy bun, pretty disgusting. We don't expect 5 Star fine dining at an establishment such as this but at least get your timing right when throwing frozen mozzarella sticks in the oven. Bottom line: eat dinner somewhere else and bring a flask... Bar rescue didn't do much but improve aesthetics and still not much of an atmosphere at that. Thank goodness decent comedians actually perform or this place would be out of business."
1007,2,"I had Saturday brunch here this week and was terribly disappointed.  In the past its Radio Maria has been nothing but fantastic, but all they had for the lunch menu was a set of sandwiches.  Really nothing exciting at all.  Make sure you check to see what they're serving that particular day before you go for lunch."
36549,3,"This is definitely a unique vegas spot, something everyone should try at least once. Took my brother and my girlfriend here on our last vegas trip and was able to handle about 2 hours inside the cold. Girls- dress warm, not cute. You will freeze if you come in a black dress. Guys- drink some beforehand. The drinks are good and strong, but you don't feel them as much because you're freezing your ass off. Fun place with a great staff"
12339,4,If you want more of an upscale feel of a casino then look no further! Make sure you bring plenty cash because the winnings over here are a lot less likely. I mean it's vegas and once you find your favorite place to gamble stick to it. It's one of those to each is own kind of situations but I rather not gamble here. Never had much luck but have friends who have!
24996,1,Food is just ok. I'm not asking for culinary genius but something that isn't dry and hard to eat. However iron city was half off so all was not lost. Waiters would take food around to every table asking who it belonged to. This happened all night long.
13956,1,"This review is for the New Years Eve Prix Fixe dinner. For 150, you expect the meal to be special or at least memorable, this was neither. There were only four courses, two of which were barely warm.  The crabcake was very fresh, but lacked the big chunks of crab that you should see at a nice seafood restaurant. It would have been better if it was hot. The truffled kabocha pumpkin gnocci was the only dish that impressed me. Again, not hot enough. For the entree, I expected to see lobster or crab as one of the options, after all it was New Years Eve in Vegas! Not so, I ended up eating chicken coq au vin, which was moist but I wanted something more gourmet than chicken. Beef was an option but I don't eat it. The dessert would have been good but it contained peanut butter, which I despise. A lot of people have peanut allergies, so I can't believe this was the only option they had. And they never even announced that it had peanut butter, they should have noted it on the menu. My gf did the wine pairing, she did not like most of the wines. I would never come here for a holiday prix fixe ever again. The service was friendly, but a little slow considering the place wasn't exactly packed. They took forever to bring the bill and process it."
5867,1,"Grandview Saloon is only Grand for their view.  We sat in the upstairs dining room over looking the city.  I was surprised this was not an open air space, specially since we were dining in August.  Minus 1.\n\nSince we had a large enough group, we ordered 3 appetizers, calamari, bruschetta, and another fried dish.  The calamari was good, but nothing I haven't had at many places before.\n\nI was not in the mood for a meat dish, so I ordered a pasta dish.  I inquired about how heavy the sauce was (it sounded like a white wine sauce and I wanted to make sure it wasn't a cream sauce).  The server assured me it wasn't too heavy.  I was presented with a late of pasta for a family of four, with some vegetables mixed in, doused with a mound of creamy white sauce.  Much to my disappointment, I could only  eat a small portion, and since we were going out after dinner I couldn't take anything to go.\n\nI visit Pittsburgh a few times per year, this is one place I will not be asking to return to."
17523,2,"I went here twice for the time I have been in Las Vegas.  The first time, it was pretty good, Service was nice and fast, the food came out at a good pace, everything tasted pretty good.  The second however, I was not a fan at all.  There was one other table that was seated so I assumed things would come out at a steady time.  Boy was I wrong.  On my second visit everything was the complete opposite, and I wanted a nice bowl of ramen.  Please do not get it here, it is actually the instant ramen stuff, which made me so sad.  I feel like i should go in one more time to see how it is, but after the last visit I dont plan to anytime soon."
18309,1,"Amazing decor! And with BJ and good music playing, why is this club so lame? I literally walked in and out. The Palms hotel needs to think about the fact that they have 4 very well-equipped nightclubs capable of each  being the LIFE of the town but it's missing that umph, that pizzazz, that je na sai qua (terrible spelling).  Their clubs seriously have the best and most original concepts thus far; the Palms has the ability to bring them back to life. \n\nWith their all-access pass, they must understand that people move in and out of their clubs in order to see all of them BUT each club individually needs to be able to compel a customer to stay, to lure them in, to pleasurably entrap them. And clearly, even naked women is NOT the answer. I wanted to dance the night I came and very few people were dancing in this small club (which I happened to believe was going to be big before I actually saw it). \n\nSo, this club has the goods but the goods needs some magical sprinkle dust. The club has barily clad women, original concepts, gaming options, good music, cool beverages, amazing decor (though a small venue), they have all of that down. What are they missing? What do Vegas addicts crave? What do nightclub fiends desire? What does even the average hotel patron want? NEW! They want New. I would not suggest starting all over because the mold is there. But you have to re-NEW the place and thus re-market as well. You have to bring both new and old faces in. Try different ideas out first and see how customers respond. Get bunnies...and maybe even chippendales that dance...possibly even dance with the patrons (in appropriate ways of course).  Get even better music. Good food, perhaps? Ask employees to come to the club at night and dance and mingle energetically. Anything different. Bring the ENERGY back!"
41909,1,"Not authentic mexican food as advertise, disappointed.\nBurn beef, hard to bite commercial flour tortilla, nothing to be excited about, maybe the only mexican is the owner, sad."
16569,3,"I've been here a few times for brunch and I've found it's kind of hard to go wrong. There is never a wait, you can pick if you want to sit inside or out, and there is usually a pretty fun crowd at all the tables. \n\nI've tried the breakfast burrito which is my favorite, it's hearty without being too gooey or stuffed. It's definitely a big meal, so expect to walk away full and ready for a nap. I've also tried the Doctor's Ordered eggs dish (which surprisingly flavorful for something that is considered healthy) and the Huevos Rancheros (which is good but too heavy for me). \n\nA few tips about this place: \n* Get a side of the potatoes, even if it doesn't come with your meal. They are SO good! \n* As always, I like to start my brunch off with an appetizer of a pancake (because I'm a fatkid) but theirs is not listed on the menu...just ask for it if you want one or an entire order. \n* This is going to sound weird, but they have great toast. The bread they use is thick cut and delicious...plus they have good jam options at the table. \n* The service is kind of hit or miss. I've had great waiters (he made me a tinfoil rose) and totally crappy ones (took our order, had someone else deliver the food, and then didn't come to check on us at all...as in we had to get up and go ask other servers for help), just giving you a heads up."
31890,3,"Located inside Monte Carlo next to Dragon Noodles. They have a Sunday Red Sauce Dinner with 3 course dinner-salad, entree, dessert. It comes with free breadsticks and marinara sauce. The waiter was good on refills. Nice place to eat there for dinner."
16139,3,"Went here after a day of drinking and gambling on our last night in Vegas.  There were three of us and we each had the loco moco and the Filipino breakfast which consisted of tocino. garlic rice and three eggs.  I was full, but it tasted so good that I kept on eating.  Wished they served the oxtail soup before 11pm cause I was too drunk and full to come back later."
8882,1,"Hipster central. An old Victorian home converted into a cool laid back bar. Drinks were decent, just typical normal bar drinks. Parking is rough and it's a packed house especially on a Saturday night. It has the capability to accommodate a larger group but you might have to wait around a while.  Server forgot the order and took over an hour to get a club sandwich-nothing special. If you don't mind the chain smokers and the hardly working misters and go with a group this place can be a winner for you. I'd rather hang at more low key places & not at a college hangout spot."
25585,4,This small cafe has the best sandwiches and cookies in town! All the waiters are very helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is cheerful.
8378,1,"As for the equipment- I don't think it's bad, it has everything you need to have a good workout. The reason why I only give it two stars is because for all the classes they offer the instructors always shows up 5 mins late. Yesterday I was there for a 5:45 class, the manager walked in at 6:05 and said there is no instructor? She than began to give the class even though she did not know what she was doing, but that doesn't matter I give her an A+ for trying. She proceeded to do a 20 minute workout and told us she had to leave (which I do not blame her) and said the substitute would be here in a few mins to finish the class. I left the class and did another workout and guess what..I watched the classroom and the teacher never showed up. I hope lifetime opens up soon around here."
30214,4,"You will want to move here if you love macaroons, and if it were not for Aux Petit, I most definitely would.  They have a lot of different flavors, but the chocolate sesame and pistachio are my favorites.  The cookies are rich yet light, and not excessively sweet.  The ratio of cookie to filling is just perfect.  Stop in and grab a case (or two) of 20 or you will want to kick yourself afterwards."
9939,4,"I found this restaurant on OpenTable.com and then looked at the Yelp reviews to verify. I made a late reservation after seeing Zumanity at NYNY.   We took a short cab ride over, and our driver verified we had made a great choice for dinner. \n\nThe outside seating was pretty bare because it was cold, but once we stepped inside it was packed. I was glad I had made a reservation becuase we were seated right away. We ordered the red sangria.....excellent. A little on the sweet side, but very good. The service was very fast, and they brought out each tapa as soon as it was done, so our food was hot.\n\nWe ordered: manchego mac n cheese, patatas bravas, chicken skewers, and mini sirloin burgers. Everything was great, and the patatas bravas were really spicy . I have had them at other tapas restaurants, but these were the best. The mac and cheese was also excellent. Everything we had, we would order again. The menu is very reasonable. I look forward to going back again next time I'm in Vegas. We had a wonderful meal and I highly recomment it."
23039,3,"I had a bad couple experiences coming here because I always came at night while bar hopping.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I recently came here for dinner and I loved it.  Since we live in the area, we found a 40% off coupon in the mail and decided to use it.  I guess they were trying to use the coupon to lure in locals because the coupon came with a few shots from management too.  Although the food and service were really great, I don't think I would pay full price to come here again.  It's definitely a step above an Applebees or TGIFridays but it's not good enough to pay $15 for a burger.  I may have to come back for the all you can eat ribs night."
49949,1,"Getting out of the Upper Deck after a Hockey game will be your first nightmare if your seats are there. Only two escalators lead down and out and the wait can be up to 20 minutes for the thousands of cheapskates. If you survive that wait then good luck exiting the shopping center parking lot. It looks like Black Friday shopping day out there. The wait to get out might have taken an hour, but luckily I entered a nearby bar and drank away the long line of brake lights. Inside the arena is a pretty good view from the Upper Deck, but didn't bother trying any food. Get VIP or figure out some way to avoid the mass crowds and it would be a better experience."
46367,0,"Where do I start? I recently moved into the neighborhood  and was extremely excited when I noticed this place. I love a quick healthy option and this seemed perfect. Well, far from it. One evening I decided to try it out, checked their hours on the website to be sure they were open it was 8:30p and their site stated they closed at 9:00p. Awesome. When I got there 10 minutes later I walked in to the chairs being stacked up and food being put away. I kindly asked if they were still open to which the 6 employees standing around responded in unison looking around at each other, \""uuuuhhhhhh, uuuummmmm....kinda.\""  So I'm standing at the door like an idiot waiting for someone to say \""of course, we're open until 9:00p, how can I help you?!\"" But no, I had to make the first move to say  \""well, sorry to bother you I guess I'll try this some other time\"" .  They said bye, GIGGLED, and continued closing up shop early. \n\nMy second attempt was unfortunately forced upon me this afternoon. I'm a medical sales rep and cater several lunches per week and had a request for gluten free meals. Grabba Green came to mind so I placed a phone order. After providing my CC info I made a split second decision to ask for all sauces on the side. The employee became quickly and noticeably exasperated, literally sighing and speaking a million miles a minute telling me she now had to hurry and go tell the cooks that sauce was on the side, to which I APOLOGIZED, just before she hung up on me. I showed up, practically bagged my own food, and left.\n\nIf service was better I could see myself using them a couple times a week to cater these lunches (which typically range from 15-50 people and at about $10/meal that would be a nice bit of business for one order). I don't care how great/healthy their food is, the service is horrible and their employees are incredibly rude. If I were the owners I would be livid at the way these kids are representing my business."
17480,2,"I'm going to bump up a star for them because since my initial visit (over 2 years ago) my opinion has shifted slightly.  With the addition of other bars on this part of Fremont, The Griffin has become, for me, a good starting point when I'm trying to get cheaper (relative to the other bars) drinks that are made strong.  Maybe the \""cool kids\"" have flocked to new bars because the scene in here isn't so cool-drab as it was before.  I like the fire places and whenever the back room is open, the music is diverse.  They've played 80's in the back before and if they played that every night I'd give them 4 stars."
11119,3,"Last week, on the way from the Airport to the Convention Center, me and my buddies decided it was time for some breakfast.   Fortunately, we came across this IHOP.   The place was pretty empty, I believe there were only two other parties there besides us.   The service was fast and friendly.   Our hostess / waitress (Shee was her name) was awesome.   The food was average for an IHOP.   You know what you will get.   As a bonus, this IHOP is close to the Pinball Hall of Fame.   \nThis is a good place for breakfast.   \nWill I be back?   Yeah, maybe."
24577,4,"French cooking at its best! Vogue Bistro provides a wonderful atmosphere for a couple or a group. I've done both. A great selection of cocktails martinis compliments a menu that leaves nothing to be desired.\n\nPersonally I like everything I've ever ordered here especially the meatloaf, steaks, and any of the chef specials. You won't be disappointed no matter what you get."
18583,0,"Rather unimpressed. We got our fish tank and our first several waves of fish from here. The cookie cutter advice we received here led to the death of our fish over and over again. We finally went to a mom and pop aquarium shop where we got good advice and healthy fish, now they're thriving. \n\nAs far as service nearly every time we went in we had to go hunt someone down to help us. I mean you'd think someone would keep an eye out near the aquariums for folks who need help, I can't just grab my own fish from the tank....."
821,0,"I'm on a quest to find a phoenix and dragon similar to my favorite Chinese place in Indy. This is the closet I've come, much to my disappointment. This restaurant keeps getting into my apartment building, despite the security doors. Today they just stuck them in the elevator. Which I thought was pretty neat compared to their normal door spamiming. Then I went down to the first floor and realized they also just scattered them all over the floor.\n\nIn my phoenix and dragon I had five \""jumbo\"" shrimps. Which are really just average sized shrimp. The only thing I can think of is that they consider the mini shrimp some Chinese places have as normal. I guess compared to those the shrimp is jumbo. The \""spicy chicken\"" is just general tso's. I got medium spice which was barely spicy at all. Most of my dish ended up being peas, carrots, and onions in a weird \""spicy\"" sauce that wasn't very good.\n\nI also got the rangoons. Some one else mentioned in this that they don't really have much crab. Which is an understatement. There's maybe a flick of crab in each. They're still fairly good, just not crab.\n\nI suppose the worst part was delivery time. The confirmation email doesn't come with a estimated delivery. Whatever, my boyfriend and I expect 40 minutes like normal. 40 minute mark rolls around and we haven't gotten a call. Since our buzzer system isn't set up we were worried that they didn't see the note to call and were buzzing us. The person who answers says it's in the car and close. 20 minutes later we're still waiting. My boyfriend calls back and goes to give his info. The lady says, \""Oh, you just called. It's almost there,\"" and that was it. Uhm. Ok. A little less than 10 minutes later and it arrives. The driver apologized and It was still hot. So there's that.\n\ntl;dr small portions, not jumbo shrimp, not spicy, not very good, long wait, unfriendly staff on the phones, friendly drivers, and they litter my apartment building a lot."
22017,2,"I might be finicky when it comes to Filipino food, but there is one thing that I cannot resist but getting from time to time. I love my Ube and Pan De Ube is one of those items I yearn for. While some of the other items tend to be too sweet for me, I do like the Pan De Sal. A simple breakfast of this bread, fried eggs, and sausage makes me reminisce about my time in the Philippines. \n\nI agree with other Yelpers who say that the items do not tend to last long. Overall, I would recommend to buy enough to eat that day. This is difficult because most of the breads come in a generous amount."
24582,4,"I knew I wasn't trippin' when I saw a skinny, dancing banana at the house party I went to last night, A. because I was sober (boooo), and 2. because it was Halloween. But today, right in the middle of a post Halloween funk/Sunday blues combo, I started to wonder if maybe I was slipped something last night, when Mr. Incredible who was there too, greeted me at Pink Spot. To protect his identity I won't say who it was, but the tomato, egg, bacon, avocado sandwich with chipotle mayo, sprouts and American cheese on wheat bagel he made me, truly hit the spot, and the mocha was just what I needed to lift me out of my forlorn state. It's a good thing they have free wi-fi here, because that's why I'm yelping. I'm going to go ahead and throw a solid five stars at these guys because they genuinely accomplished something that trumps, taste, price or ambiance; they served up a generous helping of good humor. And it wouldn't hurt to up their star count a little after that dreadful Megan D imposed her two stars. Who does she think she is anyway, trolling around Phoenix handing out miserable reviews? Wait... go back to that happy place Dugaldo. Happy place. Pink Spot."
45070,4,"There is a long wait but it is well worth it. I ordered the jalape\u00f1o poppers, pork burger, and the truffle Parmesan fries. Everything was absolutely amazing. Definitely some if the best food I've ever had. Finish everything off with an Oreo Shake!"
24116,2,"Like Monica, I never had the chance, prior to moving to LV, of trying Brooklyn Bagels, and I have to say that I was a bit disappointed.  I've been to this location many times because it's so close to where I live.  And I agree that the employees are always very cheery (even early in the morning) and eager to help.  My problem is that the bagels I've purchased have been very hit or miss.  Sometimes they're fantastic, crisp on the outside and pillowy on the inside...other times, they're hard (stale-like) and really dry and crumbly on the inside.  It's hard to rate this place higher than 3 stars when half the time I can only eat half the bagel before my jaw gets tired of chewing and chewing the rawhide-like bagel \""crusts\"".  It doesn't mean I won't still go here once in a while, but it's always a crapshoot (sooo apropos in Vegas ;)).\n\nOne big plus: the coffee is always fantastic.  Much better than the starbucks next door."
15745,2,"I used to like Famous Dave's a lot more than I do now, but it's still an alright place. I think I am done ordering the burger here, because it is not very good. Their BBQ has been pretty decent though and their service is usually up to par, which makes a difference.\n\nIt's not a place that I am overly excited to keep coming back to, but I am sure I will be back someday to see if they can impress me yet."
43089,1,"Sunday brunch, is just average, nothing special. As for the selection I felt it lacked in variety...basic breakfast foods and flatbread pizzas. (Upstream set the bar high for brunch) the food wasn't cold but  could've been hotter. Previous reviews said the beer was watered down, it must be a theme w/their alcohol selections b/c the Bloody Mary was watered down as we'll, I'm not sure if it's the mix they used...have definitely had better.  The atmosphere is cool and it was packed, but just don't see what all the hype is about."
18967,0,"This place always has very long lines, even at the self checkout stations. On top of that several of the checkout stations are always closed. I can understand being too cheap to keep the checkout lines adequately staffed, but closing self checkout lines while customers are spending several minutes in line just seems malicious."
15359,3,"I had alway's heard about this place on the Food Network but for some reason I never knew there was one in Las Vegas.  I only found it because my fiancee and I were going to watch Beatles Love at the Mirage and that's when I saw it.  \n\nWe were seated right away and after a lengthy look at the menu my fiancee decided on the chicken soup with noodles and I finally decided on getting the Woody Allen.  The waiter warned me that it was a very big sandwich and just wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into. \n\nThe soup was brought out and in the bowl was some noodles and the chicken soup in a little pitcher.  They pour the soup onto the noodles in front of you.  She loved the soup but I thought it was kind of bland.\n\nThe sandwich finally arrived and OMG this thing is freaking huge.  If you love corned beef and pastrami you will love this sandwich.  One thing's for sure, they give you plenty of meat.  Spread on some of their homemade mustard and take an occasional bite of their homemade pickles and everything just seems to meld with each other.  \n\nI only ate half the sandwich and I took the rest home.  The waiter was nice enough to give me a little container to take some of the homemade mustard home so I packed the meat, mustard and a few pickles and used my own bread at home to make another sandwich and it was just as good.\n\nDefinitely have to go back there the next time I'm in Vegas again.  Their desserts looked really good too."
18322,4,"My aunt decided to treat me to Tao Beach for my 21st Birthday. It was basically my first 'lounge' experience and I couldn't feel more privileged enough that it started on a luxurious note. We went in on a boiling August day and weren't asked for a fee upon entering which relieved me a little, apparently it was only because my aunt reserved a couple of cabanas for the both of us. They're expensiveee! For us to get a chance to spend the day there, we were charged with a minimum food purchase of $100. \n\nTheir chicken skewers were the bomb. served in small portion, we chucked it down pretty fast. After that, I was given my first drink - a strawberry mojito and I must say, it was prettttyyyy good! We were provided with a pretty biiig bottle of ice just in case the alcohol gets too strong, we'd just douse it in. Music was great, not as loud as a club and the place encouraged a vibrant social atmosphere. great for a little girltalk and bonding time. Chill, classy and soo high-end. Will definitely go back once I can afford it."
46472,1,"*I am not a vegetarian. \nMy usual Thai restaurant was closed so we've decided to try another place out.\n\nOrdered chicken pad thai and a pineapple fried rice.\n\nNoodle for pad thai was undercooked, it was too chewy and some part was hard. \nThey did not ask us for the level of spiciness, just gave us a very sweet pad thai. It was too sweet for me, because I usually have spicy pad thai.\nOther than that it was okay.\n\nFor the pineapple fried rice, it just tasted like catchup. \nSome might like it, but not for me. I am used to other restaurants' pineapple fried rice which does not taste like catchup at all.\nFor me it was horrible. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is outdated. Looks like a local family owned restaurant.  Nothing below or above that. Which I do not mind anyway.\n\nOverall, I would describe the food as...food I get to eat when I go over friend's house. Not extremely good and not awfully bad, but just little different taste than what I usually have. Different style.\n\nDefinitely a homemade food taste. If you get what I mean."
24572,4,"A new slice of gastronomic heaven has opened in the northwest valley. Vogue Bistro and Bar, located in Marley Park at 15411 W. Waddell Rd. in Surprise is pleased to bring Cordon Bleu Culinary School trained Chef Aurore de Beauduy, most recently the former Chef at the Silverleaf Country Club located in DC Ranch in Scottsdale, to create contemporary American cuisine with a French bistro influence.  Now you can fulfill those gourmet desires Tuesday through Saturday,11:00 AM - Midnight or at Sunday Brunch from 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM. They are closed Mondays. \n The ambiance is contemporary upscale with a crisp clean black and white d\u00e9cor. Located in the Bashas Shopping center on the far west end of the center, it's not at all what you would expect for a neighborhood bistro in Surprise. They have brought class to the area, with style and service you would expect in the finest cities of the world. But then many of the residents in Surprise and Sun City are world travelers who will return frequently for the more sophisticated dining experience near home. \n Our server, a delightful young lady, recommended a bottle of wine, Barro Rose Pinot Grigio from Italy (www.bacchannalwines.com) glass $9/ bottle $32 from the extensive wine list. Most of their wines are imported. We were pleased with her suggestion and the opportunity to taste two of her recommendations.  \n Vogue owner Roman Yasinsky suggested Frito Misto $4 the tempura-fried calamari, seasonal vegetables, ginger bits, with a light aioli dip. He brought us an extra spicy dip to try as well. The presentation is delightful with swirled crisps piled high. Both dips and the calamari were very nice.  \nAdditional \""Starters\"" on the menu include Bruschetta $3 with Chef Aurore's daily topping selection; Escargot $7 a delicate escargot sauteed in herb infused garlic butter and baked in a puff pastry; Smoked Salmon $9 luxurious house-smoked salmon, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, pickled caperberries, red onion, artisan toast points. The smoked salmon is also available whole, for take out orders; Olives $7 house-marinated premium Mediterranean olives; Artisan Cuts $9 country-style p\u00e2te, assorted artisan sausages, salami and cured meats, olives, toasted almonds, Dijon mustard and warm handcrafted bread; Skewer $7 a daily selection of skewer grilled savory meats or seafood served with local seasonal greens and shaved Parmesan; Cheese $7 fine artisan cheeses from the world's best producers. \n Next chef sent us a delicious Burotta Cheese Caprese $8. The creamy cheese from Italy is a special appetizer/salad not on the menu, and a unique twist on the traditional Caprese. Fresh basil and tomato accented with an Italian balsamic and this heavenly cheese that melts in your mouth instantly, lighter and sweeter than a traditional mozzarella. It was very much a pleasant surprise to experience something new and so delicious. \n The Vogue Salad $8 with frisee, arugula, gorgonzola blue cheese, dried cranberries, pecans, pumpkin seeds and bits of applewood-smoked bacon tossed in warm sherry vinaigrette can be a meal in itself when topped with steak $4, chicken $4 or fish $4. The flavors of each unique ingredient combine to a flavor explosion so wonderful and satisfying.  \nIn addition to the wonderful list of basics on the menu everyday, Chef Aurore prepares specials and I was luck enough to experience her Duck seared breast confit paired with red cabbage in a fig emulsion $28. Tender and flavorful, the duck had a fig emulsion sauce that complemented the red cabbage perfectly. It was accompanied by a butternut squash souffl\u00e9 that was more like a dessert with its naturally sweet light as air texture. \n My dining companion enjoyed a Chilean Sea Bass $17 with endive and burotta cheese, basil and vinaigrette. Extremely light with a mild flavor, the bass is a good choice for warm summer dinners.   \n Other entrees on the menu include Steak Frites $15, all natural, prime grade Black Angus onglet steak prepared \""medium rare\"" with brandied peppercorn sauce and served with Vogue Fries; Roasted Chicken $15, half chicken slowly roasted to perfection in herb-garlic jus, and served with Yukon Gold potatoes and roasted carrots; Fish $15, daily seasonal fish served with roasted sweet potatoes, local greens and warm citrus. She'll also be doing daily specials like osso buco, daurade, foie gras, cassoulet and duck confit. \n Under the category of \""Accessories\"" you will find some unusual but exciting offerings. Vogue Fries $3 are incredible according to several sources. Crisp and delicious, they are a perfect accompaniment to any sandwich or entrees and are served with a savory dipping sauce. I can't wait to return to try the Sweet Potato Fries $3 described as luscious and healthy on the menu, but \""orgasmic\"" by a fellow diner. Vanilla Butternut Squash $3 is local organic butternut squash with vanilla beans, and Georgia pecans caramelized in maple syrup. too long again azphm .com for more... I have more pics too!"
25187,1,"One star for getting in \""VIP\"" .... aka being a moderately attractive girl in a skirt in vegas\n\nAnother star for the poles in the middle of the room mounted on a platform. Lets be real, there is no way in hell I'd get up there, but it was a refreshing departure from the professional biddie sluts to see that all the masses were allowed up there ... aka great entertainment.\n\nAs for the rest of the club .... typical. Las Vegas-y. Smoke machines. Deafening house music. Packed. Sweaty.\n\nOh, and my personal favorite ... the promise by the promoters  of 'free drinks for girls all night,' ....no. False claim. \n\nThe SIX DOLLAR glass of cranberry juice I ordered (a smart girl's gotta bring her own flask!). Not to be outdone, and in an effort to further torture the sober, a bottle of water was $10. Woof."
46622,2,"I like this place,  but the bathrooms are disgusting. There is never toilet paper, they were out of soap last time and  they had no paper towels to dry hands. Other than that, the little cafe is pretty decent and the drinks are cheap.  Good times can be had."
12320,1,"This place visually is nice, as far as the attitude of staff and service don't expect too much unless you are the money mogul type. This place is ran by old school people that still lives in the 1930's. They try to pass off as if they are hardcore bad asses or something, especially on the craps tables.\n\nI am sorry to say but this place is stuck up, but hey, i guess it is to be expected that's life."
14454,1,"This place is ahhright, in my opinion. It's koo if you are with a group of friends who enjoy downing margaritas, than the margarita boat is the way to go. My girls and I headed here at the start of our night, mind you we showed up tipsy (it's vegas, I refuse to act my age! =) ) anywho, we got a margarita boat, downed it, ended up becoming part of the drunken idiots on the balcony for a quick second and then rolled out......individual drinks aren't worth it, you are better off sitting at a penny machine and getting the free cocktails lol. But most def koo on the boat."
1293,2,"Papago is a great place. Staff is accommodating and friendly. The location and scenery are great. One key problem, lack of posting for the appropriate tee off locations.\nPlease mark by colors at each tee off. Provide better signage for those of us who are new to this course. Please consider making these suggested changes. I would have given this course a higher rating of the signage was appropriate."
2479,3,"This is a great library. It's in a good location, the WIFI is free and there's a good selection of items. They recently started stocking television shows, which is awesome! They have both old and new shows on DVD and the best part is, they're free! I really love the hold system. If there's something I want at another library, I can just place a hold and within a few days, it's shipped to me and I can pick it up. \n\nThe staff is pretty great at this location. Everyone i've encountered has been helpful and nice. All the librarians who do storytime are great! The shelvers manage to keep the shelves in decent order and the check out desk is quick with my holds!"
11803,2,"You get what you pay for kids. My friends and I booked a room here for CHEAP (for 5 days we only spent $300) and we weren't expecting much. They don't have free internet, the casino has a crap ventilation system so even though I was smoking (it goes well with my alcohol) even I was sick of always reeking like an ashtray. The smoking floors stink like it as well and none of the windows open for fresh air, which is disappointing. \n\nThe food options are limited, it's at the north end of the strip away from everything, and the garbage on the street reminds you that the surrounding neighborhood isn't that great. \n\nOur first night some drunken idiots next door came back to their room and made one hell of a racket. The hotel handled them quickly and we didn't really have any problem with them after that. I will say that I felt like one of the more uppity individuals on our floor. There were several drunken fights between couples and one even had their kid in the room (all class baby) that we had to contend with. \n\nFor what we paid I didn't expect much, however, the next time I visit I'll spend more to be in the middle of the strip and away from the toothless wonders I was surround by here."
7220,4,"This place is fantastic!  Every time I go I try something different.  The family who owns, cooks and serves at Da Vang are very attentive, give great advice on what to try and really work hard to make your experience a good one!  Love, Love Love!"
3672,0,"It was 11:30am and my wife was out with the girls for lunch and I was craving a nice greasy McDonald's hamburger and fries. This McDonalds was on my way home from a meeting and was the perfect place to fulfill my gastric cravings.\nAt the drive through I ordered a quarter pounder with cheese meal. I live about 5 minutes from the McDonalds and my mouth was watering all the way home. Got home and unpacked my goody bag. I took one bite of the hamburger expecting my cravings to be answered. Well...the bun was HARD, the burger DRY and the fries were like dry straw! At least the diet coke was as advertised! \nI landed up throwing it all in the trash and eating a leftover salad from the fridge. \nThe quality control at that McDonald's is horrible and I will never go back there again and would tell others to do the same for take out. Eat in, you can always go back to the counter and get a freshly made replacement."
26549,4,"We were vacationers looking for a quick, but good Mexican meal after a hike. This place did not disappoint. We ordered the Parrillada for two, with extra guac and chips. Everything was delicious. The chicken was good, and all other meats on the dish (beef, chorizo, carnitas) were excellent. If anything, we ordered too much food, but gladly ate nearly all of it. The medium and spicy salsas had both flavor and heat. The wait staff is helpful and friendly. Not sure how this place ranks among locals, but for visitors not used to authentic Mexican fare, who are looking for a quick and reasonably priced meal, this is the place."
3114,2,"An improvement over my last mexican meal here in Arizona, but just pretty average.  The chicken burrito was ALL chicken inside, not spiced or seasoned, just cooked chicken.  A bit dry as well.  The green chile sauce over the top was outstanding and the moist tortilla made up for the insides sort of sucking wind.  Tacos were a weird deep fried flour tortilla.  Not so good.  The tostada shell was soggy.\n\nGood service and nice decor, but just OK food."
45731,4,Love this place! I'm obsessed with burritos and these by far are amazing. They have many different options and they will make pretty much anything you want. The employees are very friendly and it seems to be a family-owned business. They offer many different options/sauces that you can't get at the chains. I've been several times and recommend trying this place out!
32862,0,"I've probably had more bad meals in Vegas than anywhere else in the world. Let's face it the food quality overall in Vegas sucks.\n\nThis place is just another example of an over hyped, underwhelming Vegas eatery.\n\nI could only eat about 1/4 of my plate (not because of the portion (it was tiny), but because it was disgusting) and I was not alone. I was sitting at the counter and plate after plate of barely touched meals were heading straight to the trash bin.\n\nIf you've got the drunk breakfast munchies, take my advice and head over to the Denny's. You'll save yourself about 50% and will be less disappointed.\n\nSimply disgusting."
32658,1,"I haven't been back to a Chili's in a long time and when we were given a gift card after moving to Pittsburgh we decided to use it. Their service was really nice, but their food was lacking. My husband and I shared their fajitas for 2 and were given the wrong kind of protein, we asked for pork, chicken, and beef. We were given shrimp instead of chicken so they replaced it with the chicken. The waitress let us have the shrimp, but decided to not eat them since they seemed a little under cooked. Also when our sides to the fajitas were served we noted that the beans were cold, and had to flag down the waitress to heat them up. \n\nI will say that their pork was really good as well as their beef, their guacamole was tasty but could use more lime. \n\nThe ambiance was nice and the place was clean. But overall despite the friendly service, we were not very impressed with their food."
3897,3,"We went there on a Thursday night past 8 o'clock so we were seated quickly. The food was great, and so was the service was pretty good too. I would have given the place five stars, but halfway through dinner, an alarm went off and didn't get shut off for around five minutes. Also, one of the waiters (not ours) was trying to show off with some wine glasses and ended up dropping several due to a miscalculation. Practice makes perfect though. I didn't mind that so much but the alarm was a bit unnerving. I'm sure that wouldn't happen again though. I'll definitely go back."
27030,3,"This beautifull, old fashioned Hotel with great rooms is situated in a quiet road. But very near to the center, by feet only some minutes. The reception was very friendly. The room is clean, the bathroom gigantic with tub and shower. The bed feels fine.\nAfter two nights: the room is good, the bed a little to hard. The breakfast not good: old joghurt, burnt toast, grapes \""with fur\"" on them. Perhaps because there is some refurbisching done. \nAll together: okay, but perfectly situated"
18310,3,"I love Dean and Deluca...they always have the best sandwiches and salads!  When I arrived in town for Thanksgiving, it was the first place I visited.\n\nI love that you can visit and get a whole meal to go, eat lunch there, or go for a dessert and coffee.  It truly is all things for all people.\n\nI only wish we had one in Houston!"
37882,2,"Let me start off by saying that the drinks were fantastic. Very creative and fun. However, the service was not great. I was there on a Saturday night (granted, it was after Fight Night and it was pretty busy). The bartenders told us to take a seat if we could find one and wait for a waitress, so we did. The waitress took the orders of the ladies sitting next to us who sat down at the same time, but did not take our order for another 20 minutes. Also, the DJ that night was pretty terrible. Overall, the drinks were worth the trip, but the rest needs a lot of work."
41230,4,"I went here last week with my best friend because I had a terrible neck ache that was plaguing me for days. Glamorous day spas have nice facilities, but they never seem to have very good massages. I'm glad I came here because they relieved my neck and shoulder spasms.\n\nI went around noon and it was very quiet and relaxing. The massage therapist focused on my knot areas and I left in much better shape than I did when I arrived. I highly recommend this place!"
8060,3,"We came here for my birthday while visiting Scottsdale. We hadn't been to this restaurant chain before, so we weren't sure what to expect.\n\nInterestingly, they start you off for a walk through the kitchen. There's even a booth in the kitchen (by reservation for you foodies out there!) if you want to watch them cook. \n\nMy husband is Italian, and he enjoyed the meal, so it must be good. We had an appetizer platter with mozzarella sticks, calamari and stuffed mushrooms, and a special gnocchi with pancetta (I'm pescatarian so I had to pick around a bit). The food is delicious and served family style. We had enough food for lunch the next day!"
19894,2,"I was on vacation and forgot my medication, so I came here on a random Tuesday to get a prescription filled. There was only one pharmacist working, so a simple prescription took about an hour (the medication is already pre-packaged). It was a bit frustrating to wait so long for something so simple.\n\nOther than that, it's an average Walgreens but there are peddlers outside, and the clientele inside can be a bit odd. It's nice that this location is open 24 hours."
39164,3,This place is great! A burrito shack & circle k gas in one stop! Where else can you stop and get gas for yourself and your car in one stop? Fill up your car and try the breakfast burrito supreme...you & your car will be gas-ed for the whole day.
16097,2,"Trendy ass crowd where 30-year olds, hipsters, and bachelor parties are thrown. That said, great selection of beer. There are two locations, but I heard the #1 is the better of the two. Not much seating, so get there early to post up. Change of pace than campus bars."
23913,3,"My boyfriend has taken me here twice and I really loved the food both times. It didn't take long after we ordered for our food to be done. The strawberry limeade is a DELICIOUS drink but I didn't really love the miso soup, wouldn't order it again. The dish I ordered was the beef and broccoli...AMAZING both times. First I ordered it with fried rice which was okay, the second time I ordered it with regular brown rice and this was better. I just felt like I could enjoy the perfect flavor of the beef and broccoli more when the rice \""had a little less going on\"". \n\nWe will definitely go back to Ling & Louie's for the food (and the limeade) but I really can't say much about the service here. The hostess was friendly both times but the wait staff wasn't great to us either time...not rude but nothing to rave about either. Also it was a little awkward for me to have most of the staff in my direct line of sight standing in the kitchen area either A) eating, B) fooling around with coworkers, or C) standing around doing nothing...both times we were there. \n\nThe food is awesome though, so we'll be back!"
36286,0,"Haven't gone here in a long time and I have to say things haven't changed. \n\nI decided to see if it had gotten any better, I am referring to the service. it doesn't matter who you get they are all equally terrible and rude. This will be my very last visit here since nothing will ever change. \n\nI ordered a Thai Chai tea with milk (cold version). The lady delivers my drink and I tasted it and it was pure sugar you couldn't taste anything else but sugar! On prior occasions this was not the case! I asked her to take it back and add more milk less Thai tea. So she brings it back but no change at all even after adding more milk. So after taking one sip I told her I could not drink it and she actually had the $&@;! to tell me not to order it again that it would always be like that. She was lecturing me like a child and for the sake of not making a usual scene like I would if I was alone. This time I was quiet and didn't talk back. \n\nSo it's safe to say if you like crappy service and being lectured just go here!"
32774,4,"I LOVE THE ABC STORE. \n\nI am used to loving the ABC Store in Hawai'i and this one in Vegas on the Strip is no exception!\n\nI love, love, love all the grocery selection. I was able to quickly get a gluten free lunch or breakfast here for cheap. And, oh yeah, stock up on Hawai'i-made stuff, too!\n\nTons of Hello Kitty Vegas souvenirs! If you are looking to get something awesome, DO YOUR SHOPPING HERE. Don't go anywhere else for a few groceries and stuff to bring home."
26154,0,"I had an oil change ($69.00) and paid extra for the works wash. When i picked up my car, it didn't look like it had been vacuumed. They sent me back to the vacuum area, and while I waited a guy was trying to tape up the vacuum hose with clear packing tape. I was tired of waiting so I asked for a manager. Oscar came over and proceeded to tell me that they couldn't pick up dog hair and that if i had wanted a detail, i should of paid for a detail. The woman who vacuumed the other side of my car was somehow able to clean it. Oscar was the rudest, most obnoxious person I had run into. And he was the manager. Shocking!!!"
7557,4,"My daughter and I had food delivered yesterday. O my goodness everything we ordered came hot and freshly prepared. My favorite was the Crab Puffs and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. My daughter loved her Fried Shrimp and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The portions were big enough that we shared with my 2 boys when they got home. I had the Combination Dinner, it was a lot of food. My daughter had Chicken, Rice, and Shrimp. Will definitely be ordering front them again. Also they were very friendly. Even answered questions we had about a different dish."
45111,3,"As for delivery pizza, this is as good as it gets in AZ.  Forget all those big pizza chains.  You can't get the flavor from them like you can from Barro's.  I absolutely love the tomato sauce on their pizzas and the crust is doughy but not too soft nor too crispy.  \n\nAs for their salads and their salad bar in the restaurant portion, it leaves a lot to be desired.  Iceberg lettuce?  Seriously?  At least throw me a bone and throw in some spinach or lettuce with a little color to it.  The toppings for the salad are not the best either.  If you stick to delivery with Barro's, you can't go wrong."
4886,0,"Waited 40 minutes in line at the cage on a Sunday morning. There wasn't even a lot of people in line, just really slow processing. There was a gambling addiction brochure on the counter that said \""the fun stops here\"" - oh you bet the fun stopped after waiting that long!"
24652,3,"I like this place a lot, however I think it needs a little work.  I love that they have better quality items and more avalibility than Buffalo Exchange, but the artsy design on the inside is cool but kinda half assed.  Overall I really like the concept and am a huge advocate of small business, so I would reccommend it to a friend."
34866,2,"Busy atmosphere and can be a bit of a wait. Food is decent enough and the price O.K.. \nI did find the most memorable thing about Big in Japan, was the service."
43605,1,"World of Beer? Should be world of poor service. Went there at 4pm on a Friday, sat at the bar and waited and waited. Finally after literally 15 minutes trying to flag one of FOUR bartenders , we left. There are plenty of places to go..So sad because I had just been there a few nights before and had great service and tried a new beer. It wasn't really that busy, I dont understand it.\n\nWe will give it one more try..."
35679,2,"I see Cafe Anfora is getting a bit of grief for their bathroom....!! It's a cafe, not a toilet - the toilet is a minor detail.\n\nANYWAY, the cafe itself isn't too bad! It serves cakes etc, when I asked if they had anything for lunch they said there was a wee problem in the kitchen, they were lovely about it so I wasn't too bothered. Ok my scone was a bit chewy, but it was edible. My coffee was nice and warm, just how I like it, but I noticed some people turning their back because it was too cold. Uhoh.\n\nIt's not bad, but it's not amazing either, and the toilets make it different!"
7045,4,"Next time I'm in Phoenix this is my first stop! I ordered the Lo Los with a side of green beans and corn bread. WOW, I love that southern cooking! The sweet tea was amazing and at how many places can you order Kool-Aid on tap!"
14164,4,"Wow.  I can't say enough about this place.  The prices for good food on the strip are relatively steep, but the prices here were downright reasonable.  And the food was great.  The wait staff bent over backwards for me, and quite frankly, I ate most of my meals here over 5 days.  How could I do that?  The menu is HUGE, man!  I would strongly recommend this restaurant."
19216,2,"I visited St Francis for lunch with a couple girlfriends. Kinda pricey for lunch, but we knew what to expect and wanting to try it out. Luckily, a couple of us with smaller appetites were able to split our Pig Dip sandwich without any fuss from the staff or 'split' charge you sometimes see at more upscale places. They even served it on separate plates and gave us each our own basket of fries. \n\nThe sandwich was quite yummy and we enjoyed a couple brews, as well. We sat outside on a beautiful day and their patio is quite cozy and nice. I'll probably be back. :)"
4694,0,"Wow, dude was stoned or something.  I was looking for a bike and asked \""how would X compare to X?\""  Answer: \""It's black, it's legit, too legit to quit.\""  I'm not joking.  So maybe this is the greatest shop in the city but I didn't stick around to find out.  It was a very uncomfortable experience."
27468,3,"The very definition of the phrase \""sensible shoes\"", Barnet's sells a wide range of exceptionally practical brogues, sandals and slip ons in a wide range of colours such as brown, grey, beige and shoe colour. Aesthetics are shunned in favour of comfort, practicality and waterproofness, and the footwear on offer here looks exactly like what an elderly Scandinavian who likes hill walks and coach tours would love.\n\nGiven that's the main demographic on The Royal Mile, they're onto a winner."
42313,2,"I hate to be such a Debbie downer with my 3 star ratings!  This was my first experience at a revolving sushi bar, which was super fun!  I would highly recommend sitting right next to the conveyor belt if you go in a group because that was the best part of my experience and I was in complete shock how cheap our bill was when we were done\n\nThe sushi was, mehh.  There was only 1 roll that we pulled that I thought was great, but everything else was just ok (and we tried ALOT)...Lots of imitation crab which is probably how they keep the prices so low.  I'd go again, I suppose, if someone else wanted to but only after recommending another place first.  All in all if you were looking for a review to convince you to go, you should go because it was fun and as you can see other people really like this place based on the reviews below."
25138,1,First time I came here I ordered beef patties.  They didn't have any cooked so I bought them frozen. It was a bit of inconvenience but it was still good! \nToday I came once again no cooked beef patties and no frozen patties!! WTH!! Guess I'll find a new Caribbean restaurant.
23529,3,"I have been frequenting Hef's since their opening night. I almost always find myself satisfied. The place is rarely crowded during the day. The staff is very laid back and generally friendly. One thing I have noticed is they must have a subscription to like ESPN6 because there always seems to be some offbeat sporting event on their TV's. \n\nI have always enjoyed my food there. Yes, always. They have a good burger, excellent turkey club... yeah it's not a complicated menu but they get it right. There's not much to the salad if you get it as a side so I'd probably opt for the fries or pay extra for the mixed veggies. I haven't had the wings in a while but those were pretty good too.\n\nUnfortunately, as of January 2010 they no longer do lunch hours. I told you it was never crowded in there so I guess that's what happens. That kind of sucks.\n\nMy one gripe? They're charging in the 8 to 9 dollar range for many of their sandwiches. I have no problem with the price because it's quality. But for God's sake, their house ketchup tastes terrible. If I'm paying top dollar for a good sandwich, can I get a decent ketchup for the burger or fries? It's like having Marilyn Monroe as a model and dressing her in parachute pants. C'mon Hef's, you've gotta do better than that."
45906,2,"Well, with all the hype I had to go to Hakkasan. Unless you are down to drop a couple grand, this is not gonna be such a sweet experience. I went when Calvin Harris was performing. First, Harris is extremely overrated. I've been to plenty shows, and I can confidently say Calvin Harris is not even in my top 10. Second, the venue itself is classy, but it's kind of a maze and the dance floor is freaking tiny. Surprisingly, the drinks were not that expensive for Vegas. I should have listen to my pals and gone to XS. Oh, well. I needed to experience it myself. Definitely not going back, though. The lasers are badass, however. One of the best equipment I've seen."
20769,2,"I like a good dive bar. A place where you can sit, get a drink for cheap enough and not be bothered. So, when Nathan S. and AMber W. brought me here, I thought it was cool. While I'm not likely to rush into any mosh pits, I can get into a little punk music given the right environment and Rogue West is the right environment. \n\nWe took our seats and the bartender came for a drink order. He started by asking to see my ID. I thought: Hell yes, I'm gonna love this place. Until, the \""punk\"" said, \""Wow! You're older than I am.\"" \n\nSo, for that... you lose one star."
11963,1,"Eh! This place looks promising after looking at reviews and the menu, but don't be fooled it's not great!  \n\nWe started by ordering the fries sampler with zucchini, Mac n cheese and pepper jack shots (just fried cheese). This was delicious!' Then we ordered burgers and shakes and beer. The burgers didn't come out as ordered and at the end we were charged for everything we ordered that wasn't on the burger. The burgers took a while. The shake and beer we ordered with our appetizers didn't come out until halfway through the burgers! We also had to remind her twice about them!!  \n\nThe burgers weren't very good. The pepper bacon was sweet... Shouldn't be! The burger meat was mealy. I would only go back for the shake (Nutella with Godiva chocolate liqueur) and the pepper jack cheese shots. Don't go in with high expectations!"
15417,1,"This is our traditional birthday celebration go-to place for great food and wonderful service...but lunch this Saturday was awful! Food took forever, as well as our appetizer of 4 oysters (how long does it take to shuck an oyster? Evidently 30 minutes) The manager did pay for the appetizer but our entrees then took another 25 minutes....\nUsually they offer free dessert for a birthday, and this waiter couldn't get us out fast enough. He also never refilled our drinks.\nGoing to Brio's next time!"
46676,4,This is a great pizza place. Perfect brick oven taste at a good price. The pies run you for about 12 bucks. If you've ever been to Grimaldi's before this place has a similar taste. Best pizza restaurant I've been to in Arizona yet.
44694,3,"I've been waiting for this new place to open since spotting its construction phase.  Finally had a chance to check it out last night on a first Friday since it's the only time I go to downtown LV.\n\nI was kinda intimidated at first since I'm not really used to seeing people in downtown all dressed up fancy and $hit. I felt under dressed but hey it's downtown.  Who dresses up to go here? \n\nI was really impressed though with the decor of this place, from the \""postered\"" up wall, chairs, chandelier and so on. And damn,  people here are good looking.  Never been in a place where my neck went sore from turning heads from these stylish attractive ladies and no homo but the guys here are good looking too, haha. My friend Morgan was the Dj that night too, spinning all the great underground hiphop with beats that got everyone vibe''n and getting down on the dance floor.  \n\nOne thing I didn't like though was the drinks here were expensive, something you'd expect from the strip and not downtown LV. Ordered my first organic beer (Samuel Smith) apricots which deducted $13 bucks from my already light wallet that night.  Gotta admit, best beer I've ever tasted though.\n\nI'll definitely come back here again though and dressed up all stylish next time.  Overall, I recommend this to everyone who hasn't been here yet."
37597,4,"This place rocks!!   To be able to kick my feet up, drink my wine, have a blanket handy, and watch a movie was a great experience.  I only tried the dessert so maybe next time I'll try some of the pizzas."
45370,4,Great service. Thank you for the great job this team does. Professional and just great
44526,4,"As a resident of South Scottsdale, this is a true gem.  The food is fresh and crazy good.  They are creative and farm to table I believe is truly what they are.  The cocktail program is spot on if you want to enjoy true craft spirits.  The service is 5 star and you never get disappointed."
45351,2,The picture comparing the burrito to an arm is a lie! My burrito wasn't half the size of my girlfriends arm! :(\n\nAnyways... below mediocre burrito but their taco's are comparable to taco el gordo.\n\nThe place is located on tropicana & pecos in a pretty big plaza. The interior of the place is super clean and spacious. Along with a well stocked sauce bar.\n\nWalking in I was a bit confused on where to order but soon realized it was laid out like tacos el gordo. Order what you want at a specific window. And the ordering process for a burrito is similar to that of chipotle. Have an empty tortilla and fill it up with your own personal preferences. \n\nIn the end I ordered the asada burrito & pork taco. Burrito was pretty lack luster since I couldn't even taste any of what I was eating. Taco on the other hand was suppppppperrrr juicy. UNFFFF. \n\nPro tip: You can get free elote if you vote for them on best of vegas :o
36895,1,"Trendy atmosphere, friendly yet slow staff, good sandwich but not mind-blowing. Maybe I expected too much."
13454,4,This is a very nice place to find any clothing you can never think of from any brand install the pricing is very depend on what you want to buy. \nYour tourist and you come to town to the right place for you to find the best deal from all the different stores. \nvery recommended
8840,3,"While cruising down University killing some time, my friend noticed The Chuck Box, and stated that we had to go there.  Other than the obvious mentioning of hamburgers, we had no idea what to expect, but based on the fact that it was a little wooden shack that was spouting smoke, we assumed it HAD to be good, and right up our alley.\n\nLater that night after a Fall League baseball game, we decided that it was the perfect time to try The Chuck Box.  The parking is a little sparse, but there was space for me, so no complaints there.  The exterior is about as dive-y as I would have guessed, to no complaints there either.  Upon entering, the interior is total dive, wooden walls, tables, benches and stools.  No velvet ropes here, but a bigass chain to separate those in line with the rest of the customers.\n\nI ordered a Big Juan, and savored the pleasant aroma of a slab of beef going onto the grill right before my eyes.  It was cooked perfectly to order, and I took my time at the condiment area to load it up with what I like.  But not too much to eliminate the flavor of the beef, which was cooked just right, still a little juicy, but nice and warm, with good natural flavor.\n\nMy only knock on it is the cash-only policy.  There is an ATM there, but typically I don't carry cash on me, but since I was being all touristy, I was prepared.  But that just meant I had to pay for my ill-prepared friend who was being too cheap to get decked with ATM surcharges.\n\nOtherwise, The Chuck Box was a fantastic find, and well worth the experience, and was a fine burger overall."
37203,0,There is nothing positive at all. Unkind staffs and damp popcorn. the worst popcorn that I've tasted.
11775,4,Sapporo is my favorite place to eat in all of Arizona. I love the teppanyaki grill.  We go for Happy Hour quite a bit and the staff is always so nice and the food is AMAZING! I have suggested it to family and friends and they all rave about the food and experience they have. I love the calamari and the scallops and shrimp. They also have the best drinks. I will be going back consistently!
34685,2,Fries are great but everything else is terrible.  I would eat here more often if they improved their burgers even just a little bit.
30125,1,"We visted this place several years ago and throughly enjoyed it. I would have rated it 3.5-4 stars back then.  Oh how the mighty have fallen. On our recent trip we had dinner here and it was bad!  Alot of the food was old and cold. The king crab legs tasted like salt licks and a large number of other dishes were too scary looking to try. The prime rib and desert section was Aria's only saving grace. The gelato was housed in a revolving freezer that sort of reminded my of a Ice Cream Pistol LOL.  Avoid eating here as this is no longer a good buffet.  There is an all you can drink option for beer and wine for $12.99.  I suppose if you drink enough the food might taste better LMAO\n\nThe lobster shown in photos is availble on Fridays and I think Saturday, the price is considerably higher and you are limited to 1/2 lobster tail per person."
46493,0,"Place is sad! Place has little to no hope! The brats that run it are rude! The kids that sell food are not trained! They were closed for how many years? They had how many other water parks in the country? Who designed this place a class of kindergarteners? The lay out is stupid! The lazy river is tiny ! I have seen apartment complexes with bigger kids areas ! The life  guards ? All I have to say is I hope they never have to save anyone in my family! The movies in the wave pool! My tv is bigger and has better picture too! I am a season pass holder! 2 years now! It has not gotten better it's gotten worse! The place is hot like hell the water is freezing and they have nothing for kids other then the 3 little slides that are super crowded because the bucket area which the employees have named \""Misery Island\"" is too rough and crazy for little kids! Place is off my list haven't been back in 5 weeks! Cowabunga bay........ They were late but they got it right for the kids! Anyway I can get a refund wet n wild? LoL yeah right a joke should have stayed closed"
48483,4,First time there and seriously impressed. The server did not stop moving once. She was the bartender and server and the place was fairly busy. Great atmosphere and the food was delicious. I'm still full but already thinking about what I'll have the next time I'm there.
4476,2,"We never, ever have good service here.  About a year ago, we waited at the hostess stand for so long that we decided to leave.  When we got to our car and put it in reverse, all of a sudden, a waitress comes knocking on my window!  It scared the living daylights out of me and made me almost feel sorry for her.  I guess times really ARE hard when a waitress comes outside and figuratively begs for her lost tip.\n\nAnyway, I was dismayed when that same waitress ended up at our table last night.  It was obvious why we waited so long to be seated during the previous visit.... she was slooooooow and seemed completely oblivious to my agitation.  There were only two tables in the whole restaurant, so a glass of water shouldn't take 15 minutes to deliver.  Ugh.  \n\nThe three stars are for the STEAK TIPS.  Oh my, they are good.  Whether you get them as a breakfast platter or a dinner platter is irrelevant.  The sides don't matter at all either way.  I haven't actually had more tender, flavorful, and consistently good steak tips anywhere else.  I don't say that lightly either - I'm a carnivorous sort of lady.\n\nSo come here if you've got all night to waste, because it's probably gonna take that long to get your order.  But if you order the steak tips, it'll be worth the wait!"
30068,4,"I was actually kinda dreading getting to 299 reviews because that meant I would have to man up and write this review... one I've been holding for four months. Well, the time has come and I can't hold it off any longer. It's time to put Sage in the books and celebrate another hundred.\n\nIf you haven't figured it out yet, Sage was one for the ages. Or is it one for the Sages? Ha!\n\nIt's interesting what you remember four months after eating at a restaurant. The little things are gone and what remains are the things you probably won't ever forget. At Sage, it was the impeccable service. It was my awesome veal cheek entree. It was the oh so tacky (and historically inaccurate) way of lighting the sugar cube for our Absinthe. And most notably, it was the ab-so-loot-ly ah-may-zing foie gras brulee appetizer. I haven't taken the time to rank them, but that delicious, delicious blend of gamey creaminess is in the top three starters of all time. It was just that good. Honestly, every bit of that meal made it a fantastic way for my wife and I to celebrate our eighth anniversary.\n\nThat's it. That's all I waited four months to say. Now go eat."
115,0,"My guess is that \""Ruth K.\"" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a \""business\"" only prepares food (chicken/tuna salad, hummus) once a week?  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge?  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!\n\nBTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.\n\nAdded note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there."
19150,0,"Believe the reviews. Think I'm finally done with this place. I usually just get brown rice & teriyaki chicken, so I'm typically spared by the fact that they're always out of everything. I always attributed it to the fact that they get a heavy lunch rush, and just don't handle it well.\n\nToday, i got there at 11:30 after working a very early morning, expecting piping hot pans of (relatively) fresh-looking food. To my amazement, it was the worst i've ever seen it here; every pan had barely 2 or 3 scoops of food, and it was all picked over with barely any meat in anything, with sauce burnt to the bottom of the pan. It immediately became apparent that they had just reheated last night's leftovers, and hadn't finished making new food for the day.\n\nAbsolutely appalling. Not that I should have high hope for a freaking Panda Express... but good grief guys."
5157,3,"I found Snick's first on Yelp looking through a list of dives near Theatre 7, and through word of mouth (a friend who had been there before).  Snick's, being just two spaces down from Theatre 7 was the ideal candidate for drinks after an event held in the lot this past First Friday/Pollygrind kick-off party event.\n\nThe bartender (the shorter, gray haired fella) was incredibly friendly, and cracked jokes all night with everybody he talked to it seemed.  The drinks, even the more quality beers, were relatively cheap.  I'm told that on Saturday nights there is an evening happy hour that is awesome, but we didn't make it out there the following day.\n\nThe jukebox is great!  The selection is good, but it really shines with the search feature.  I've searched many a juke in my day, and this one turned out some of the most obscure tunes I could think of."
41152,1,"A overall disappointment! I always enjoy going to a place where they give out free peanuts, but normally the fun is throwing the shells all over. Here they give you the peanuts, and no real place to put the shells. Apparently, the floor is not expectable here. Also, the \""build your own burger\"" theme is not original at all! In fact go to McDonald's and ask them to add or take off any topping to any burger and they will.....way to go you \""built your own burger.\"" I just saying that this can be done ANYWHERE.\n\nThen I ordered the bacon burger with grilled onions. I ended up with no bacon and for some reason mushrooms. Once I advised them of the problem they were kind enough to give me some bacon that looked like it was cooked yesterday. The bacon was cold, old, dry, and all broken up. At that point I felt like they might as well just have given me bacon bits from a jar. \n\nIf I or anyone else is going to pay $11 for a drink, burger, and no fires, they should at least get the order right."
45422,3,Genuine waitstaff...\nGood greasy burger and fries...\nGreat funky feeling!
7749,0,"Went to see if they had any liquid for my ecig and whoever was there was watching tv with someone on a couch and acted like I was bothering him by coming in and didn't have any knowledge about the products I was looking at. I asked what they were and if he knew if any of them were good and he just shrugged and said \""I dunno, I don't use that stuff.\"" I understand if you don't personally use every item in your store, but you should at least be a little more knowledgable about the things you carry and maybe try and act a little more friendly in the future. I don't need sunshine and rainbows, but at least don't look annoyed that I just interrupted what you were doing.\n\nSuffice to say, I won't be returning here."
45648,3,"One of maybe 3 theaters in Vegas which isn't located inside of a casino!  The AMC has a very modern feel complete with stadium seating (which I guess is pretty standard).  I haven't visited the concession stands, but they have 3 available on really busy nights.\n\nPrices are consistent with the other casino theaters and they have a $5 movie day for those in the gaming industry (Wednesday maybe?).  I wish the restrooms were a little more up to date with the rest of the building, but other than that, no complaints.  The location is definitely a major plus!"
27512,1,This is a cool place to have a drink and munch on some decent pizza and killer prosciutto. The waitress was just dreadful however and please please please get rid of those friggin chairs that fall back when you sit on them. That alone made me never want to return. The place is pretty cool to walk around and explore however. \nI give it 3 stars for the food but 2 for service.
26734,4,Service at Audi Henderson is awesome. I have never felt so comfortable with anyone. Brett is an awesome guy and he is so helpful. I seriously would keep my Audi because of this guy and will continue to buy Audi just so I can take my car to him. LoL. Awesome guy.
36940,3,"What more can be rewarding after a 5 hour hike at Red Rock, I'll tell you what....a good ass breakfast!  My first time here and by the looks of the food on the table and how crowded it was being a wednesday afternoon, I knew it was gonna be good.\n\nMy friend was on her whack diet (she ain't even fat), so she just ordered tuna salad and biscuit with gravy.  I ordered the mexican omelette and red velvet pancakes, which I never there was such a thing.  The mexican omelette had marinated carnitas, sliced jalapenos, pico gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with sour cream.  It was pretty good but the red velvet pancake was the main dish I enjoyed the most.  I have never been a big fan of anything red velvet and this is the first.  She gave me a bite of her biscuit and gravy but I thought she was done with it and I killed it.  Haha she was like really, I look down for one second and you eat it all without sharing, ooops.\n\nVery affordable too with friendly servers who attend to you right away and checks up occasionally, despite the place being busy.  I will definitely be coming here for breakfast again. My ex and her tuna salad, what a waste of visit to baby cakes for her."
5579,4,"Amazing jewelry store. We've bought and had fixed/serviced our watches, rings etc They are wonderful. Unfortunately Danielle, the lady who usually answers the phone, has poor phone manners. I won't give T Bird less stars though. She just needs to check her tone of voice!"
9006,3,"Vitos \n\nShitty lil strip mall...good pizza. \n\nI had been driving around for a new place to check out, since it feels like forever since I reviewed anywhere. I miss ma Yelp. \n\nplace #1 closed for the day \nplace #2 appeared to be closed down \n\nDesperate and hungry i found Vitos via Yelp and was ahh what ev... \n\nI ordered the thick crust and listened to other yelpers talk shit about coworkers, chatted with a guy from Surprise and waited. \n\nThe pizza was good, sauce was a bit salty but I liked it. The crust was thick chewy on the inside and crispy on the bottom. It was good. \n\nAfter 2 slices and one more bit of the corner of one more slice, I packed the rest to go. The neighbor kid was walking by as I drove up so he was in for a good snack as I gave him the left overs. \n\nWould I go back? Maybe if I were in the area or suggesting it to someone but it is not better then Barros to me. Sorry."
47832,2,"I came with the ladies to sit around and relax until a few others were ready to join us for the next leg of our epic day.\n\nI ordered the pistachio latte as a blended drink as it was a rather hot day. It was decent, tasted like having a decent pistachio ice cream. The size was about a 16oz cup and since I got almond milk it was almost $6 for a beverage and I'm not sure if it was good enough to warrant that. \n\nI wanted some sort of sweet but the selection was sparse to honey toast, one kind of cake in the display and a few french macarons so I passed. \n\nThe place is pretty cute though and it's open late in a area where there isn't many late night spots. I'll probably try other items off the menu and re evaluate how I feel about this place. First impressions was just A-OK."
13105,0,"First off, I've cancelled my reservation with them out of frustration from their lies. I booked a room through their website because of their \""Best Rate Guarantee\"" promise. Having gone through all the hoops they make you jump through to beat the competitor pricing by 20%, I've found that their promise is a load of crap. Despite me sending the requested evidence, apparently the time stamp on the bottom of the page when you print from a website is not a legitimate time stamp because \""it shows when you printed it, not when the deal was active\"" on the competitor site. This is so BS!!! How else am I supposed to show a time stamp??!!!! How else can I print out a deal from a website unless that deal was currently active!???\n\nWorst customer experience ever!!"
21080,1,Went here for breakfast...The service was pretty slow.  Not sure if it was the half filled tables or they were just making sure they overcooked the poached egg and made sure to burn my girlfriends French toast.  The orange juice was pretty good as was the sausage and bacon.  Other than being burnt the French toast was ok.  I would probably find another place for breakfast unless you are drunk which in this town may be a strong possibility at 9am.
31054,2,"The drinks are good, and service is spot on when the place isn't super crowded. The music can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's awesome, and sometimes not. All in all an okay place."
1694,0,"Now I had a very bad experience with this groomer. Now the shop owner was sweet at first but in my opinion must have become jaded over her long standing years as pet groomer because when I heard my dog cry out from the back room and asked if it was her lori's answer was \""that falls under the category of oh well that's to bad it has to be done\"" I couldn't believe she said that to me but I kept silent I just knew my dog wasn't one to cry like that anyhow I'm going to make a very long story short and let y'all know that the result of that was my poor baby nails being clipped on one paw way to short so short that they were bleeding however I didn't know until I got home and rinsed her off to make sure she was hair free and the powder she had stopped the bleeding with came off. I'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared. I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either. Sorry for dragging you through the mud Lori but in your own words \""that falls under the category of that to bad it has to be done\"""
14170,1,"We came here for a quick bit.  I was not impressed at all.  The food was fancy American fare, but was only ok.  The drinks were off.  The menu was big, maybe there are just too many items for them to be good at something. It was an ok dinner, but I just don't think why I would come back.  It was not cheap also."
35572,2,"I came here the other night because I was craving Banh Mi and I really hate the Banh Mi at Lee's Sandwich. I read somewhat good reviews abotu Mr. Sandwich's Banh Mi so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe sandwiches were definitely better than Lee's, but I have had better. Unfortunately, it was in California that I had better so I'm still on the hunt.\n\nI am, however, intrigued by the other items they have at Mr. Sandwich, so I will be back to try those. Until I find a better Banh Mi spot, I will be coming here to get them."
735,3,"We found this place off of Yelp and after reviewing the reviews my husband and I decided to try it out. We went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the food and atmosphere was awesome. I do not recommend to take small children. The atmosphere was very romantic with dim lighting and they had someone to play live music on the accordion.\n\nI ordered the house special which was the Whiskey Shrimp and Chicken. This dish was so good, it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the Bake Zitti which was great as well. For both of our meals plus wine and a few beers we paid an average of 60+ bucks. \n\nWe will definitely go back again with friends and family."
25453,2,"I think I expected just a little bit too much here. In terms of French authenticity, this restaurant has met my expectations. Unfortunately the portions I got lacked considering the price.\n\nThe octopus and lentil salad was good, however I wanted more octopus and less lentils. Good thing my friends liked lentils so they finished that instead. The bone marrow was probably one of my favs.\n\nThe hanger steak was good, but the tartare steak was a disappointment; it just tasted like just any other steak.\n\nService was also a hit and miss. It took about 10 minutes for someone to finally come over (and that's after we waved someone over...I know, disrespectful on my end) to take our order.\n\nAgain, considering the price we paid, I probably won't go back. I think 3 stars is a bit too generous, only because I do like French cuisines and I can't complain about the environment overall."
9800,0,"took my mustang for diagnostic and oil change, everything they told me was false, car came back with 5 defective brake lights, car now runs worse than before, car was disgusting when it came back. you guys suck! dont go here if you love your car, their mechanics are shi*t! worst customer service!!\n\nupdate* ford were wrong about my diagnosis that i paid $130 for!\n\nall i needed was an o2 sensor that should have been warrantied by law as the car is less than 7 years old and has less than 70,000 miles. guess ill be looking further into this"
33444,4,"On a long walk with the wife and we ducked in here.  SUPER friendly waiter named Brian.  Excellent service,  great breakfast (Top sirloin and eggs w/ sourdough and potatoes) for $7.95.  Coffee was good too.  I even asked to speak to the manager so I could let him know how happy we were with the food and especially the service.  He was very gracious and saw him give our waiter a \""thatta boy\"".  Not one negative."
5664,1,"Get wut u pay for under 70\nRemonte for tv didnt work, water in the bath was running when we got room, wouldnt turn off ran all night, also a spider in the sink..... The only thing that will make me not come back it when we walked in the room it smelled like old cooking oil...... Made me not want to order any wings... Stayed here for one night before stay at resort"
28998,3,"3.5 stars rounded to 4. Biggest gripe is the looooong lines, especially during their Xmas BOGO promo. Had to wait an hour, and barely made the 4pm cutoff to get in on the promo (they had told us if we didn't get to the register before 4pm, it would be full dinner price per person!)\n\nOnce in, the selection was out of control. Everything and anything you can imagine, plus free beer and wine. Quality of food was very good as well.\n\nI'd suggest going to lunch for $12 or so (with the players card) as dinner is a bit pricey. I think they take reservations as long as there's not a promo going on."
37259,0,Worst service ever and over priced!! I didn't feel welcomed and they were mean. Don't go here!
44093,3,"Good first visit to this food truck that shows up every once in awhile at the corner of 3rd and Tryon.  I've tried to go before but my early lunchtime stomach clock always seemed to be a bit too early for Papi Queso.  This time though both clocks were in synch!\n\nI got the Pig Mac which is a grilled mac and cheese sandwich topped with pulled pork and bourbon onions.  The sandwich was perfectly toasted and crunchy on the outside and had a reasonable amount of filling on the inside that was melty, ooey and gooey the way a grilled cheese should be.  My only request would be more of the vinegary pork and bourbon onions to add more acid and cut through some of the richness of the mac n cheese.\n\nAll in all, this was a good sandwich served by friendly folks and I would not hesitate to stop by the next time our clocks align!"
34584,4,"This was a fun event in a gorgeous location. You have to get there early because they run out of many of the beers fast! As long as the weather's nice, I won't miss this event!"
19315,1,"When I adopted my dog, I was referred to this vet and my first few visits were great (4 years ago). Lately I've had some poor experiences that I will share.\n\n1) About a year or two ago, I brought my dog in for her yearly vaccinations. They gave her the shot(s) in the examining room and I pointed out that there was liquid on the vet's leg afterward and she wasn't sure if it was from the shot that leaked or what, so went ahead and gave my dog another shot. Swing and a miss? C'mon!\n\n2) I wanted to get a refill on my dog's heartworm medicine so I called in the order. A few days later I went to pick it up and there were 2 other patients being helped and the front desk girl seemed overwhelmed with them and the phone ringing. It took 12 minutes (I timed it) until she finally acknowledged me AFTER I signed in. A few more minutes passed and she rang me up for the medicine. It cost more this time around because they no longer carried the previous medicine I have been ordering and over the phone, I was not informed. I looked at the box and the medicine was for up to 25lbs. My dog is 38lbs and their records show this! I mentioned this and the error was corrected.\n\n3) Most recently, I scheduled an appointment for my dog's yearly vaccinations. Over the phone I asked if they needed a fecal sample and even though it was due according to their records, the person on the phone said, \""Eh, it's up to you.\""  The day before my appointment, my dog tears her dew claw, so I made a note to mention this upon arrival. I bring in a fecal sample, hand it to the front desk and mention the dew claw. I get taken back to the exam room. The vet tech, walks in, does her thing and asks if I brought a fecal sample which I replied, \""yes\"", then I told her about the claw. After answering other questions regarding diet, behavior, etc. she leaves and calls the doctor in. The doctor comes in, asks if I brought in a fecal sample and then asks THE SAME QUESTIONS the vet tech asked me as if they didn't share notes with each other! Then I am told that they don't have one of the vaccinations in stock, but could run and get it at another location if I wanted to wait. I made an appointment ahead of time and they knew well in advance what shots I needed, yet they couldn't \""run and get it\"" before I arrived? Wow! The vet then takes my dog in the back to give the other vaccinations and examine the claw closer. Upon returning, the vet says the claw will heal itself and I can apply a band aid to it if I want to. I finish up my appointment and leave WITHOUT the vet wrapping the open wound, nor providing antibiotics. 15 minutes after I leave, I get a call from the vet saying they never ran the fecal test and wanted to know if I still wanted it done. I bagged up poop and brought it to you...No, I just did that for the hell of it! Moron!\n\nA week later, after wrapping the claw myself, I examine the wound, and it is not any better. I call up a family friend who also works at an animal hospital and schedule an appointment with them. Over the phone, this new location was shocked to hear that no medicine nor bandage was provided. I go in for my visit with this new place and they couldn't have been any better. Yes, my dog needed medicine, had the wound cleaned, inspected, and wrapped.\n\n\nNeedless to say, after this past year or two, I will no longer be taking my dog to VCA. They have become sloppy and unprofessional and in need to clean house."
46154,1,"Yes, only 2 stars ... why? I was craving Firehouse Subs. I had been to the Rainbow location before - and well, not just for the cool soda machine, but my sandwich was excellent - service was excellent. OK ... so, back to this BRAND NEW Durango location: sandwich - very good. staff - very good and accommodating with our special request. HOWEVER, this store is DIRTY! Maybe it was the end of the night, maybe a little of the dirt and crumbs were because of that, but there was a lot that was old. Also, on the table that holds the napkins and silverware - there was a bucket with wet towels, soaking in a cleaning solution - just sitting out in a service area.\n\nFirehouse Subs is also known for their selection of hot sauces. They had a huge selection, including their signature sauce. Every bottle I opened to try had a crusty, dried up ring around the pour area. In otherwords, they never wipe down these bottles. Discusting.\n\nLastly, I had not noticed the mural on the wall until I read the previous review. This is VERY disturbing! I wish I had taken a picture of it. It is a yellow Clark County Fire Truck - a fireman holding a hose, and - wait for it ... water coming out at full force at a fox. The poor fox's body was bent in half from the force of the water! I am sure it was meant to be fun, however (and this is coming from someone who does not get easily offended), this was straight up cruelty.\n\nWould I go back to Firehouse, sure .... would I go back to this one - no."
33015,0,"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. This is the second time I have left there so unhappy. The first time my Fiance and i went in and got mani's and pedi's. they were rude to both of us and acted like they hated every second of us being there. I THOUGHT it was probably just a fluke and I gave them another shot this afternoon. ... and I wish I hadn't. I only had limited time so i picked my pink color and asked for just a regular manicure. THe girl then proceded to tell me that that the pink wouldn't look good on me. I should just do a french manicure with pink tips.I said no I just want them to be all pink. She said \""It no look good, to much pink for you\"" I thought she was joking bc who the hell says that??!! ... but she wasn't. She then told me well its only going to last 2 days with this color. So i said 'Oh is it a bad brand should i pick another brand'? and she said 'no you can do gel manicure'. I again said nope JUST the REGULAR manicure, and she shook her and and said ok but it is going to chip because your nails are so OILY..... WHAT??? AGAIN who says that ... in all my years getting manicures I have never had issues with my nails being to oily for a manicure. This literally went on for like 5 min and I should have just left. The manicure she gave me was TERRIBLE and she was so sloppy with the clipping ( she wacked them off, and the edges were like razor sharp) filing( so uneven, I had to tell her to fix spots)  and the paint job was uneven and lumpy. I literally felt like crying she was just SUCH a b*%&*h and so bad at her job. In all my years I have never NOT tipped and I did not giver her a dime more than the $12 it cost me to have this done to my nails. I just couldn't tip her. It was that bad. \n\nI WILL NEVER EVER GO HERE AGAIn... there are waaaaay to many other places to give your business too in the area."
46832,0,"Upgrade to one star based on the fact that we did eventually get resolution to our issue.  And now the details...\nWe made the mistake of not looking up this store on Yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center (The Dump).  We found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.  We had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.  Next, how to get this set into our kitchen.  We had two options: 1. have it delivered for a fee or 2. pick it up.  Well, I had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set, so I wanted to do that.  What's that you say?  I have to go way out to the Avenues to pick it up?  Hogwash!  We opted to pay delivery and not have to don our Kevlar vests to make the pickup.  (OK, I favor the East Valley- sue me).  \nThat is where things went sideways.  \nThe \""warehouse\"" folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery, which concerned me as that was the one thing I was promised as the time was a range.  No call within a couple hours of delivery so I called the store, who got me the warehouse number.  When I called, I was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.  I confirmed the address and they had the wrong name AND address.  They were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the WV.  They rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 5:00PM when we had a morning delivery scheduled.  \nUpon assembly, they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.  There were two issues: 1. one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 1/2\"" shorter than the rest.  The second issue was in relation to a bench that came with the set.  It had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it, leaving a depression that was pretty severe.  We gave it 24 hours to even out, but it didn't.  We then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the bench so she can make sure ACME (the manufacturer) would do a replacement.  Instead, we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.  The customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.  He ordered new legs for the chair and another bench.  The legs came into the store, and I picked those up but there would be a wait for the bench.  Again, they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.  When I called the warehouse to confirm again, I was told that they ALWAYS call.  I begged to differ but again, she was skeptical.  By the time we got the replacement bench delivered, nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.  Notably, the new bench cushions looked a little different than the other (it was much less loosely covered).\n\nOverall, the store experience was decent (at least I was told what they thought that I wanted to hear), the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on Yelp."
37320,0,"And the worst service ever award goes to...... Fuego !!! We walked into an empty restaurant on a hot summer afternoon when there was nobody in the restaurant. We had a group of about 10 people, and let me remind you again, the restaurant was empty. We were greeted by two servers who had a look of absolute disgust that a large party was at their doorstep. Without us even saying a word, one lady told is there was no way we could all sit together. Good afternoon to you too, lady. We went upstairs to be out of their way and there were a few four top tables right next to each other. We took it upond ourselves to push them all 1 foot so that we could sit together. We didn't rearrange the dining area. When she took our orders, she told us that she could not do separate checks. I begged her to split up the bill into groups of 4 (how we were arranged at the four top tables), and she begrudgingly said that was okay. It took over an hour for her to get our orders and for us to get our meals. We were at the restaurant for 2 and a half hours. Meanwhile, a group of 5 people had walked in 30 minutes after us, were pleasantly greeted, and seated next to our table. She took their orders, served them meals, and nicely split their checks for each person (but there was no way she could do that for the 10 of us). They came and left within an hour. \n\nThat was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Phoenix is a Mecca of good restaurants and there are plenty of other delicious places nearby that treat their customers kindly.  I'm surprised Fuego is still in business. I will never go back."

20584,4,"This is a great place!  We had the gyros, which were excellent and the #7 plate, which is shrimp kabob with rice.  The #7 was off the charts.\n\nAll the meat was fresh and the seasonings were perfect.  \n\nDon't let the looks of the place fool you, it certainly is a hole in the wall, but it is worth going in. \n\nLal, the owner/cashier was great and wanted to make sure we had a great meal.\n\nI'm definitely going here whenever I can."
46646,1,"Overrated.  Went here for dinner on 10/30/13.\n\nI had a few things, including the mushroom tart - tart was cold, but mushrooms were warm.  When food is not served at the right temperature, then I'm over it.\n\nThe garlic cream cheese stuffed peppers sounded better on paper than they did on the plate.  The cream cheese completely separates from the pepper when you cut into it.  No bueno!\n\nThe best part of my meal is the garlic bread and sweet butter.  That was good!\n\nRestaurant is dark and very large.  Self-parking in the back.  I was put off by the large number of kitchen workers taking their break outside of the restaurant that backs into the parking.  I also didn't like seeing the numerous servers inside the restaurant all chatting with one another waiting for something to do."
30666,3,"It's got a beautiful view, but well-enclosed (in the summertime, mosquitoes are a problem at Marche Bacchus in the same shopping center).  The french chef offers unique perspectives on other cooking styles.  Burgers, fish dishes and salads all have interesting twists.  I've been here for dinner and it's a very nice place for a family outing.  Service is efficient and friendly.  I'd feel very comfortable having a group of 6-10 here.  Lunch is also a good time here.  It's more mellow, and I've used it many times for business lunches.  The tables are large enough for papers and not so close together than you can hear the other tables' conversation.  \n\nIt's not a 5-star restaurant, but it's never a disappointment.  4-stars all the way."
43529,1,"Atmosphere is fun and menu looks great but there are more negatives than positives about this place... If you want good tex mex there are many better options. No free chips and salsa and no mix and match on the tacos. Service is very slow and we were not informed about any of the specials. Staff didn't seem knowledgeable about food or seem to really care. The manager walked by many times and never stopped to ask us how we were even though a dish came out late and then wrong in addition to that. Save your time and money on this place if you want good service, the food may be worth a try but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
27449,3,"This is a fantastic little (and it IS little) restaurant. It's French, so of course the wine will be good. \n\nWe had escargots (12 of them!) & the anti-pasta plate for starters. Followed by the beef bourguignon and trout, then a cheese plate for dessert. All very civilized and delicious.\n\nI highly recommend this place. Give it a try should you happen to be in the area, or make a special trip - I think it's worth it."
22149,4,"I've seen a lot of Cirque du Soleil shows, and I think after O, this is my second favorite.  Of course, the main draw to this show is the music of the Beatles.  Most of the tracks are taken directly from the Beatles' albums and played as a backdrop to a Cirque du Soleil show that was less Cirque, and more of a visualization of the Beatles' style, cultural impact, and art.  There are roughly four performers who serve as caricatures of the Beatles, and it was evident that several sequences mirrored the lives of the Fab Four.\n\nA lot of the acts did more to tell a story rather than showcase a skill, which I thought kept the show together as one coherent piece.  And although I'm not big fan, some of the interpretive dance sequences were truly memorable.  The 360 degree stage was also interesting, and while it seemed during some scenes a little too big for what was going on on stage, most of the audience a central view of the action.  The wide movie theater style screens behind the back rows added visualization effects and depth.\n\nOn the way out, I noticed several people exiting the theater still singing Beatles tunes.  But whether you're familiar with the Beatles' or not, you're sure to leave entertained."

29121,4,Great new location. I am excited they moved closer to us. Always the best sandwiches in Surprise.
46786,0,Terrible! They promote $5 mimosa yet they ran out of champagne. They also serve beers and drinks in all sorts of varying glasses and cups. The service sucks and the food is terrible. I may even be sick tonight after eating a chicken sandwich. The place was also totally empty for Sunday football. We ordered food and it all came out at random times and the kitchen kept screwing up our order. We couldn't be more happy to finally get out of the place and move to another sports bar in town square.
13797,1,"Came here for breakfast on the final leg of our Buffet of Buffets marathon. \n\nWow. If I had paid for this place, I would have been pissed. Service was excellent. I adored our server. She asked if we wanted a to-go cup of coffee. No one has ever offered that!\n\nThe juice was clearly from concentrate. The Mexican and Salad sections were closed. What? No Mexican breakfast? Those are the best dishes! \n\nMiddle Eastern included bagels and lox. This was probably my favorite section. I forced fed myself lox with capers to get my money's worth. I liked the mozzarella and tomato salad, but it was something I could find at a supermarket deli. \n\nDessert section looked like it was filled with mini packaged pastries. I selected a chocolate croissant, but it was flaky and dry, so I skipped it. \n\nOn to the American section. There were 2 types of benedicts. They looked good, but I think they became overcooked from the heat lamp. The country style potatoes were good and surprisingly still crispy. I did however, find these potatoes repeated 2 more times. It also seemed like these were the seasoned potatoes you find in the freezer aisle. \n\nThere was an omelet station, that I skipped. And I think a crepe station in the Dessert section. \n\nStopped in the Asian section to get a squirt of sriracha. \n\nI stopped off for a cheese blintz, but never ate it. It was pretty burnt and didn't have much filling. The section also included French toast and pancakes?\n\nThere was a nice oatmeal/cream of wheat section. Then, a fresh fruit section where you could construct your own parfait. 2 yogurt flavors, shredded coconut and granola? 2 smoothie options. They were really plain. I think one was banana, the other, strawberry. \n\nThe final section included spinach and cheese egg scramble, but I didn't see any cheese or spinach. There were potato pancakes. And a turkey hash which had fingerling potatoes (yum) and roasted peppers. I took the time to dig out the pepper and fingerlings. This was one of the only things that didn't seem pre-made. And it was pretty good.  \n\nI looked through the photos for lunch and dinner and they all look like a completely different restaurant! I don't know, guess they dropped the ball for breakfast. Kind of a shame for people like me who love breakfast."

8533,3,This is my second time here. I like the way they team up on my car if they have extra hands available and get it done fast. And they do a good job. I just got my car painted so I don't want the high pressure hoses used on it. They gladly accommodate by using the regular hose. They offered to bundle and save me money when I asked for a detail on the inside.

13165,3,I stayed here on an off-night and it was only around 40 bucks. Loved the room we had with the view and the hot tub. Both the exterior and interior of this hotel/casino are really cool looking. Criss Angel's show is here and it's a fun one to watch. No real complaints.
22983,4,"Excellent service and fantastic food in a great setting. The staff were knowledgeable about the cheeses, wines, food and their respective pairings.

He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was Friday and happy hour, so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us, until it came time to pay the bill, then he was really nice(tip time! Overall the food is good there, but Bo did not make it a pleasant experience. Smile Bo, it will get you far in life!"
27696,1,"The best thing about this \""bar\"" was the band and the chick bartenders that were nice and made a great cosmo. The worst thing was the actual bar itself. It's so small, and there's not much seating. I guess it's a cool idea. Upstairs, dark, small. Lol, but I thought the bouncer or whatever he was-door guy seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe cuz he was stuck outside on the stairs all night. The people there were mostly rude. We did manage to kind of create a dance floor where there wasn't one and then it got fun. But again, not a lot of room to dance. We went on a Sunday night. So perhaps a Friday or Saturday would have a different vibe and crowd. Overall kind of fun for a casual drink or maybe a good place to have a couple drinks before you go out somewhere else. ; )"
3779,3,"Dear Venezia's,\n\nI hate to default to standard letter format for this review but this is the best way that I can keep it from devolving into a total creepstore gush.\n\nI love you because when you deliver, it gets to my house hot. I love that you have been here for me during finals. Without you, I would have lived off of Clif Bars and Vitamin Water alone. You provided me with the necessary carbs to go on thinking for another 12 hours. Sometimes, you even gave me fruits and veggies. I appreciate that, \n\nI didn't give 5 stars because sometimes (just sometimes!) your pizza is uber greasy...but I know it's not because of anything gross. It's all the cheese you put on there. I like the cheese, hate the grease. I'm sorry that there's no middle ground on this.\n\nAside from that, thank you for the tangy sauce that doesn't taste like someone dumped sugar in it. Thank you for the crispy/chewy crust (how do you do that!?) and thank you for being local.\n\nSincerely, \nThat weird chick who looks your hot, indie boy drivers up and down\n\n*I re-read this and realized that, standard letter form be damned, I was still plenty creepy. Sorry Venezia's..."

7777,1,"Eeww is all I could think of as I walked the halls of this school for a tour. Most of the classrooms did not have windows. All rooms were dark and dingy. The floors were dirty and the carpet old. The entire school was very quite and did not hear the normal chatter from little children. Not even from Pre-Schoolers. The playground for pre-schooers is a joke. Completely walled up. \n\nThe school might perform academically but I think at a high cost of the childs other development including social skills and physical development, being verbally expressive etc."

While still finishing up with food, a lady came up to us and said :\"" we have a reservation pn this table.Is there anything that I can do to help you move along?\"". It was surprising because the place was empty. Another recommendation would have been to move us."
38740,4,"This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring."
23589,2,"Me & the Mister went here for lunch this afternoon; we'd never been here before.  He wanted a good burger (which he only gets a hankering for every couple months or so...) and although I wasn't in the mood for something that heavy, I was open since I usually pick the place.\n\nHe ordered a cheeseburger w/ everything hold the ketchup; I had the bacon cheeseburger - hold the mayo & fungus (mushrooms) and we shared a regular fry.  He finished his on the spot I had to take mine home.  He said it was messy but good.  I said good burgers are supposed to be messy IMHO.\n\nThe fresh, yet greasy fries in the bottom of the bag took me back in time to my days of taking AmTrak w/ my Moms from Penn Station in NY to Union Station in Chicago to visit my grandmother - Moms would always pack some various foods that some would wind up soaking through the bags; but I digress...\n\nThe total for this meal plus 2 soda's = about $21.  I would venture back, but it may be awhile.\n\n...I'm still stuffed I really don't think I'll need dinner tonight."
20985,0,"AWFUL. I used to go here as an undergrad and recently paid them a visit. I was going to Krannert for a play and was running a bit late for a full fledge sit down restaurant, and I thought Basil Thai would be a fair compromise given their proximity and relatively quick serve. I ordered their Massaman Curry and it was just plain awful. The rice was cooked too long and was on it way to becoming congee. The curry itself was tasteless, way too salty, and over spiced to the point of being bitter. The pork was over cooked. I took about two bites and tossed the entire thing. Complete waste of like $9."
7365,2,"The bread is pretty good. The Italian bake was too watery for my taste. The meat balls were decent and the sausage was ok. A fairly inexpensive meal and you get what you pay for. The crayons and paper tablecloth are a nice touch, nothing better than a paper cut at dinner."
29238,2,"Dark Knight Porter was excellent.  The Irish Red seemed off.  We were there on a Thursday afternoon.  Looks like they have bands play in the back on a regular basis.  Can't comment on the entertainment, but the beer was ok.\nThis is a tasting room for the brewery.  No food, 2 TVs, and a few chairs."

49587,0,Looked great online and decided to go in!! My friends and I were looking for somewhere fun and relaxing to go... Got to say I was pretty disappointed! Coals took forever and the sheesha was low quality! Went from fresh thick smoke to burnt in less then 5 minutes! Won't be coming here again!
3384,2,"I go here often for lunch so I figured I would write a little something about it... Love the hot sauce and the food is pretty good! I've been here at night time also to play a little trivia. \n\nAll in all, it's not the most fancy place to go but its a good spot if you want to have some lunch, do a little off track betting or just go for some drinks and food after work. Definitely filled with locals but all are friendly. Quite a few TVs if you want to see a game."
22729,0,"I wasn't expecting a lot here, but was still disappointed.  My first tip-off was when I picked up a plate at the front of the buffet and it had little crumbs of wet food and water on it....got grossed out....picked up another....same thing.  EWW.  Now I'm used to getting wet plates at buffets...not sure why that is, but it is expected.  But water AND food?!  Definitely didn't get my appetite going.  : (  \n\nWe went to fill our plates and as we were walking back to our table from \""round 1\"", my husband decided that our table was a little too far from all the food (he was right, it was).  I agreed and he politely asked if we could be moved to another area where most of the other people were seated.  The host kind of sighed and acted like this was the most difficult request in history, but moved us anyway.  The new table had lots of crumbs, food scraps and grease on the booth seats, as well as on the table.  YUM.  But it WAS closer to the buffet!  lol\n\nGot settled in at the new table (after using all our napkins wiping it off) and started checking out the food we had chosen.  Nothing that I had really stood out, but most of it was edible.  They had pretty much the standard buffet fare...\n\n-Salads (I didn't have any, but tried the hubby's seafood salad...that was surprisingly tasty)\n-Sushi rolls (was scared to try at a buffet....hubby did and said they were \""really good\""...I took his word for it)\n-Cold shrimp (passed on that too....seemed like food poisoning waiting to happen)\n-A couple of hot pasta dishes (the penne pasta with cream sauce and mushrooms was good)\n-Grilled salmon (YUCK... only ate one bite.  Too fishy smelling/tasting...salmon isn't normally like that)\n-Mashed potatoes & various sides (decent, basic stuff)\n-Chinese food (eggrolls were good...fried rice and noodle dish, not so much)\n-Mexican food (HELL NO)\n-Fried shrimp (not bad)\n-Lots of dessert (I got all excited because they had a TON of mini desserts...and I am the dessert QUEEN.  ; )  Problem: none of them are really any good!  BOO....)\n\nSo, we did our 2nd and 3rd rounds and tried to get as full as humanly possible to get our $19.99 worth.  As I kept walking back and forth, I noticed something else...my shoes kept sticking to the floor really badly, which was a precarious situation while carrying a full plate of food.  : (   It definitely gave me even more reason to think this place definitely hadn't been cleaned properly in a long time.  \n\nWhile the place was pretty gross and the food was mediocre at best, the kicker was sitting there watching the server dude chat it up with EVERY. SINGLE. TABLE. except for ours, refilling drinks when they were half empty, bringing more napkins, etc, etc....the works....all the while leaving us completely unattended and, towards the end, drink-less too.  I finally had to flag him down to ask for a refill after waiting 10+ minutes to see if he'd get a clue.  He did come grab our empty plates when we were gone at the buffet, but that was IT.  I don't know if we pissed someone off by asking (very nicely) to switch tables, or if we looked young and like we wouldn't leave a tip....I have no clue.  It was so odd and so blatant that it started to feel like one of those hidden camera situations or something!  Weird.  \n\nAll I know is that we weren't treated very well here, the food wasn't worth it and the whole place needs a good scrub down.  Find another place to get your buffet on in Vegas because MORE doesn't live up to its name...."

32291,2,"Been a while since my last Fox & Hound experience so I was pretty stoked for trying the new location (to me) at Northlake.  It is a bit of a haul for me but peer pressure prevailed and I ended up having a decent time here.\n\nOur server, Meghan was super nice and friendly.  It did get a bit busy with the Panthers game on a Thursday night - also simultaneous trivia on the same night made for an interesting time.  We didn't stay for trivia but I would have been a little peeved since the game sound was interrupted by the shrill, way-to-excited voice of the woman who runs trivia.\n\nAtmosphere is similar to a lot of the other Fox & Hound locations in Charlotte:  dim with tvs all over the place.  The tables in here are very small!  The 4 top we were sitting at was totally full once all of us ordered drinks.   Then the food came out and it was a shuffling, puzzle match as far as finding places to set things.  It worked out though.\n\nFish & Chips came out for me with 3 huge, honking pieces of beer battered/fried goodness that a proceeded to scarf down like I had never eaten fish & chips before.  It was nice and crispy.  The fries that came with it were okay - slaw on the side wasn't really anything to write home about.\n\nI'd say this is a solid hangout place if you live in the area.  Unfortunately for me, I had a nice lonely 40min drive home to Matthews, but I can see myself doing it occassionally."
10140,3,"The building is a little old, but EACH staff member I encountered took good care of me.

Lee introduced himself and said he would be able to in a little bit. They were kinda busy so Lee gave me some cool books on hair color to browse while I waited.  \n\nShortly after, he sat me down in front of the mirror and validated my concerns about my hair color.  I felt so relieved.  He was super sweet and clearly knew what he was doing. We encountered some problems (my hair reacted strangely to the bleach and turned blue/green) but he was patient and determined to make it better, which he did. It was quite a process. I was there pretty much all day. But it was so so so worth it. I really can't thank Lee enough for making my hair look and feel a million times better! lee, you're my hero!\n\nAlso, the vibe in that place is really cool and refreshing. It's got a rock n roll theme going on but still maintains an air of sophistication. I saw some reviews that said it was dirty-- it definitely was not dirty when I was there."
46578,3,Yum! First time having breakfast here. Great menu with combination of upscale dishes and standards. Large portions. Awesome porch. Bar service. Love how they converted this area landmark. Good happy hour. Solid food and service. So happy to have this restaurant/bar in this area!

Sent back.\nNo refills were brought for drinks.\nWe were never asked if we wanted dessert.\nTook a long time to get check. \nWe were there almost two hours for a \""quick\"" dinner.\n\nOnce it finally got there the food was ok. \n\nI don't know how much of this problem was fault of the kitchen, but certainly the server was clueless.

I really want it to be as good as people say.\n\n**EDIT:** \n\nI gave Mac's a 3rd try.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  It seems no matter what I order, the meat is always tough and dry.   \n\nI have, in fact, NEVER had a great meal there.   The best they seem to be able to offer is \""adequate\"".\n\nThey get 2 stars from me.\n\n(NOTE:  Mac's has other locations, and I did get a PHENOMENALLY GOOD brisket from one of their other stores)"

We also ordered tots.\n\nOur burgers were just okay. Mine was a little overcooked and just kind of lacking flavor overall. My boyfriend said his wasn't real memorable. The tots, while they were hand-made, were a disappointment. Like the burger, the flavor just wasn't there. Even though they had cheese in them (supposedly) and they were served with an herb cream cheese, they were bland and just kinda blah. And $3 for 7 tots is a bit steep. \n\nOverall (and considering the price) there are much better burger options around. Sorry Cheddatruck, but you can just keep on driving."

6910,0,"So, I was all set to give this bar a solid four stars...\n\nThey feature live music quite a bit.  Been here once a few times recently.  The first seeing a band from Austin.  It's a solid, clean, neighborhood spot a half step above dive.  The drinks are good, and fairly priced.  They don't have a lot of beer on tap.\n\nThe other time there, it happened to be a night where they had the grill going, on Mondays I believe.   Me and two friends each had a dinner platter of various steaks with sides.  The meat was tasty and well done, though not spectacular.  All the sides were fairly good.\n\nThe food was an excellent value for the price point.  Checking out the menu we saw that their other, daily basis, menu items were at really reasonable prices as well\n\nJust a nice four star kinda bar, until after our visit last night.  Five housemates, two ate the burger.  Others had veggie burger, and the chili dog.  \n\nThe fries are pretty great.  Upon noticing the menu claimed the fries were baked, and not greasy, MrT asked why anyone would want them.  But despite the non-greasy they were fairly fantastic.\n\nYou can ask for a side of their house BBQ sauce.  Not bad flavor, but it is a mainly straight black pepper taste; not quite a true thicker multi-flavored typical BBQ.\n\nEverything tasted great, everyone was happy.  All set to give the Iron Post a solid four stars.\n\nUntil a few hours after we got home.  The burger dinner folks BOTH had food poisoning!\n\nOne of the food poisoned has stated since that her six week recovery from heart surgery was less painful than her case.  She ended up having to go to the hospital for it.\n\nSo, be warned.  Maybe stick with sides or veggie options here?  Don't know if I'd ever go meat here again!  \n\nI'd give the place another chance, steering(huhuh) clear of the meat.  I would give the bar more stars, but can't forgive the disgustingly, painfully stricken."

We started with the Pig Ear and eggrolls as appies.  The eggrolls were pretty typical for a chinese restaurant, kinda blah.   I couldn't eat the pig ears, because, uh, I just wasn't in the mood for pig ears. Yeah, that's it.  Of course, the platter came to the table with a HEAPING serving of pig ears. We ordered a small, so I can't imagine what the large size looked like. \n\nI had the spicy noodle with beef in XO sauce, and my guy had the spicy noodles (vegetarian).  The noodles had the perfect chew, and the sauce was really good. I would recommend the XO sauce, the spicy sauce was good, but the XO was just better.   I would prolly hit this place up if I was still in Arizona.  It was one of the better meals I had while I was there."

33210,0,"Scratch my last review.  If I could give 0 stars I would, but 1 is the minimum.  Well, I guess I can give 1 star for the poor service guy that had to deal with my pent up frustrations from enduring the dis-functional service at Airpark Jeep.  Where to begin:  They never entered in the $2300 service/maintenance/extended warranty plan that I bought with my Jeep into my vehicle profile at the service shop.  So I paid for 2.5 years worth of oil changes etc. for no reason (even after I claimed I had one in the beginng)...then I found the agreement when I moved 5 months ago and I was not reimbursed the full amount because they pay a reduced price.  For their failure to get off their lazy tush and see if I had a service plan, I ended up paying more for oil changes...Sure am glad I bought their STUPID $2300 maintenance plan. \nEpic failure #2:  The manager failed to call me back (called 3 times) after I found the paperwork for the warranty and asked about my plan and how to get reimbursed properly.  \nEpic Failure #3:  I called the director of the whole dealership to complain about the manager that never called me back and their stupid warranty 'service' plan, and he never called me back either.  \nEpic Failure #4:  My car has 43, 200 miles on it and for the last 4 oil changes and 1 battery change everyone failed to mention anything about the 30,000 mile preventative maintenance (which could have been done gradually over multiple visits), so today when I went in for an oil change and new brake pads, they informed my I had $941 of service that needed to be done because the 30000 mile stuff wasn't taken care of (they had 13000 to make me aware of the preventative maintenance)....last time I checked that is why you take your car in for regular maintenance so you distribute such costs over time and take care of your car so you don't end up having a PROBLEM!!!! \n\nBottom Line:  Don't go to Airpark Jeep EVER for anything! The service department here is awful and I have no respect for the guy who sold me the crappy service plan either.  And the management seems to be worthless considering they never call anyone back.  I have bought 3 new cars and 2 used cars and have never had any problems like this from any other dealership.  \n\nAlso, I hate writing reviews that trash a place; sometimes people have a bad day...my experience with Airpark has been bad for 2.75 years.  Congratulations Airpark Jeep you earned yourself a hard to achieve 1 star review!"

Many tables after us got their food way before us and all we ordered was sliders, chicken strips and fries.  Server kept saying \""just a few more minutes\"" and food didn't come out in a few more minutes.  Lots of frustrated patrons waiting and waiting and waiting.  When our food finally came out, the burgers were not cooked as we ordered, the chicken strips were sitting in grease and the fried things tasted like they'd been fried in old grease.  We were in a hurry to get back to our conference so we didnt hwve time to complain. Greasy and not worth the wait or price!"

All you need to do is pluck out the meat. I ate hella.\n\nPrime rib was juicy red. Satisfies the carnivore in me. \n\nLobster macaroni- big chunks of lobster!!\n\nFresh oysters- yum! They're putting them out though- it's on purpose. Dress pretty, as all ladies should try in Vegas, and the cook might hand you some freshly chucked ones!\n\nThe sweet potato fries- omg soo good! I usually don't care for these type of fries, but these are coated with roasted sesame seeds and ginger honey (I believe) and it takes it to another level!\n\nYum mochi, macarons, and an array of unique flavors of ice cream for dessert! You can also ask them to make you fresh crepe and strawberry dipped chocolate!\n\nPresentation on the foods are lovely. Ambience is modern, clean and very pretty. It's next to the pools, and the windows give off a beautiful natural lighting.\n\nTips: Dinner is at 3PM. Come at least 45 minutes before (waiting in line took us 30 min) that time so you can pay the lunch fee instead of dinner fee. We were late because we hung out too long at MGM pool. Got there before 3, but the line of course took longer than we hoped.\n\nAvoid the carbs! Don't drink too much liquids. Eat the SEAFOOD and prime rib!!!"

11866,1,"My family and I decided to give this place a try, especially seeing what great reviews were said on yelp. We got there during the lunch hour, for a table of 8 we had to wait 45 minutes which was understandable. When we were waiting inside, we noticed the buffet option but opted to order from the menu since the lunch buffet looked basic. When the food arrived, we all agreed that the food was delicious but many other Thai restaurants down the street offer the same great taste for half the price and double the size. Food may be great but their service was horrendous. For a restaurant with such great reviews, I was surprised we had to wait 30 mins for water and made many, many attempts to gather a waiter's attention for our check. Our party left unsatisfied and made a quick stop at Mcdonalds because we were still hungry. Based on price, portion, and service...I wouldn't return or recommend this place which is why I give two stars."

32535,3,One of the best customer service experiences I had during my search for a bridal gown. The ladies there were super helpful and accommodating. Same day appointments are available during the week but there is usually 1-2 week wait for a Saturday appointment. The store carries Essence of Australia and Enzoani gowns. They were all beautiful but the selections were limited (minus 1 star).
24516,2,"We went to Fairview Grill for dinner and drinks one night. We expected an evening of pub food, draft beer, and an unpretentious atmosphere, and that's exactly what we got.  \n\nWe had a coupon for a free entree, so to us the prices were VERY reasonable.  Generally entrees (mostly sandwiches and burgers) are about $8, which is an excellent value considering the quantity of food you get. We both had burgers, and we were both very pleased. My husband had fries, which he enjoyed, and I got onion rings (of course), and they were above average. The waitress got our order correct (even the \""hold the X, extra Y\"" order we placed) without writing it down.  She was very attentive, and kept the beer and water flowing.  \n\nThe atmosphere is one of a relaxed pub--everyone was very friendly there too, including two guys who waved at us upon entering and asked how we were doing.  \n\nBecause we are right down the street from Fairview Grill, we will definitely be returning.  Might even shoot a game or two of pool. I don't know if it stands out among pubs in town, but it was an enjoyable evening overall."

18975,4,"My favorite fast-food place.  Great food combined with best-in-class service.  The people are always friendly!  I love their chicken.  It beats KFC, Church's, and anyone else you can name.  \n\nI especially appreciate three very unique things about them - 1. They are closed on Sundays.  I admire that!  2. The have a family night on Monday.  Kids get a 4 piece nugget meal with every adult combo meal.  3.  Their kid's meal comes with an EDUCATIONAL game or toy!  Their meal also preaches character instead of the latest Disney or Dreamworks movie - sorry Shrek!\n\nA class A place with great food, great service, and competitve prices.  (Sorry, no dollar menu though.)"

17692,4,Lovelovelove.  I'm not too adventurous when it comes to food but I really like their menu.  Lots of chicken dishes and all sound great.  I've tried a few things but none of which I can remember but I know I liked them all.\n\nGood mojitos and dancing later in the evening too.\n\nDefinately an enjoyable place.
10329,2,"Room was comped--  free.  Can't beat that.  Room was clean as was the bathroom.  Nothing fancy, but absolutely satisfactory.  It is a bit out of the way from the main part of the strip.  Would like to be closer to the other major hotels/casinos.\n\nSaw the Illusions show.  Theater wasn't the best.  Mostly padded chairs on a couple different levels.  It would have been nice to have been in a better theater for this great performer.\n\nWiFi was free!!!  Not sure what resort fee everyone was talking about. . .  I had $0 on my credit card when all was said and done.  Yes, the Riviera is old, but I can't complain.  Nice trip with my aging parents!!"
22294,2,"I've been looking for a good butcher and I was excited to find out about this one. The mission was to get a variety of different meats to get an idea of the quality of the quality and to see if it was worth filling the freezer. I went on a Saturday at around noon, it wasn't very busy and looked very clean. I was getting a little excited and pretty much wanted to buy everything I could get my hands on. \n  Here's what I bought, 3 racks of baby back ribs, a couple thick New York steaks, a nice looking tri tip, some pork chops, an Atlantic salmon fillet and a package of hot dogs. All of which cost about $100, not cheap but not too bad if everything is as good as it looks. I went straight home to separate everything and package everything for storage. This is when I find out that the salmon is bad, really bad. I mean when I opened the plastic bag it immediately filled the house with the smell of death. I was really bummed because I had planned on putting it straight in the smoker. Oh well, after cleaning and washing everything even close to the fish I figured I would drown my sorrows in some baby backs. I threw a rub on them along with the tri tip and put them in the smoker. I would say hands down the best ribs I've had. Sliced up the tri tip and made barbecue sandwiches, again money. \n  I had vacuum sealed the pork chops and opened them two days later, death. Not sure if there was contact with the foul fish, but, I know I didn't cross contaminate it. \n  All the beef I got was excellent, including the steaks. Grilled at 500+ they were tender and juicy. Even the dogs were good. I believe the only problem was one bad fillet. I haven't been back, I'm sure I will return with a little more discipline and not just go all ADD."
23779,3,"We totally pigged out here!  A great alternative to Vegas buffet.  The Garlic Noodles are so yummy.  The BBQ chicken pizza is not bad either.  Even my preschooler found the food tasty.  The atmosphere is casual and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  It could be a bit loud, but worked out well since my kid was watching a video on the ipad."
29919,2,"I'm with Alice and Jonathan on this one, I HATE this club. To be fair though, it's because of personal experiences so I've given it the benefit of the doubt, star-wise. \n\nThis club and Lulu are the main haunts for the yah's and socialites of the city. It sometimes screams pretentious, but sometimes it's actually pretty normal! The main student nights are Thursday and Friday, so avoid them if you don't want to be asked for a cigarette and what daddy does.\n\nI came here on a Saturday with my mum (HI MUM!) and my brothers after my brothers 21st dinner. There were about 15 of us, so we got priority entry and a table in a sectioned off area. Hey, we were pretty special. My mum and I went to the bathroom and when we went to go back to our table, they wouldn't let us in!! They said once we had left we couldn't get back. There was nothing we could say or do, so we ended up going home. \nLeading on from this, the bouncers here are amongst the worst I've ever come across. Give them a little bit of power and they think they can dictate your life. PAH!\n\nahem.\n\nSo, overall it's not that bad. It can be a bitty yah, but it does play quite good music and it can be a good night. The smoking area is tiny (they are just steps Opal!) and the queue can be a nightmare. I've waited in excess of 1 hour here, in the freezing cold, only to be pushed inside to a crammed bar, crammed dancefloor and no toilet roll in any cubicle. No thanks."
42383,0,"I thought our stay was good until you locked us out of our room 2141 and lost our reservation. Now someone more important needs our room they told us, and you still can't find our reservation. After my wife cried, they kept us in the room. They had put a walk up rate on our card since they lost the reservation. This despite showing them the travel agent voucher prepaid for our 3 day stay. They did reverse the charges and we should have our money back in a few days. Even though they finally fixed it, getting locked out of our room when I was sick, with my stuff in the room, and being told more important people needed our room, will always stick with me."
18033,4,Best breakfast burrito in the valley. I have been here dozens of times since I have lived down the street forever and it is an old favorite. You will not be disappointed.
46340,3,"Delicious food and impeccable service.  I dined here alone on business, sitting at the bar.  My salmon entr\u00e9e was prepared to order, and excellent.  Wine list is quite good.\nMarinara sauce with bread  a great, free starter."
17249,4,"Went back this afternoon to enjoy happy hour with my coworkers. We had a great time and I enjoyed more of the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale. The waitress was very nice, offered to provide us with separate checks and even took our picture for us.\n\nI loved the music, nothing better then Led Zepplin, Buffalo Springfield, and all the other great 70's tunes they were playing.\n\nThe best part is getting dinner to go and enjoying pasties at home."
40241,2,"Once you step into this place you are amazed at the money and creativity they put into this place. I totally could live in Lady Silvia and make is a batchelor pad loft, just by moving a few pieces of furniture out to make room for my bed. This place is super rad inside. The bartenders are great and very much good at sitting and talking to you and remembering your name and shaking your hand when you come in. The things that give it only 3 stars are the PRICE OF DRINKS, the gaming in the top of the bar and the never ending \""soft openings\"". I wish they would just have the dadgum grand opening already!! The drinks are twice the price of the drinks at Artifice 3 blocks away and the table top gaming is irritating because it's what I DON'T want to see in an artsy fartsy bar in the Arts District. They are just in the way of putting your drinks down and all the times I've been in there I've not once seen someone playing on them. I usually bring friends in here to show them how awesome it is in there, have one drink ( because of the high prices) and then head on down the road to Artifice or Dino's where my booze money can go 2 to 4 times the distance. I would give this place a SOLID 5 stars if they would do away with the gaming and lower the drink prices. Just saying my piece Mike and Sam, you guys have a great bar. Just needs those tweaks to make it what it needs to be and to get it totally packed."
38005,4,"Overall:  The best mediterranean restaurant in Vegas, Milos offers pure, natural tasting food combined w/ great ingredients.  Fish is flown in fresh, daily from around the world.  The chefs skills are truly shown w/ pure, un-adultered dishes, mainly seasoned with salt and pepper, sometimes olive oil, and at most w/ a reduced balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nNOTE: Both times, the chef customized our menu and we didn't have to choose items from the main menu.\n\nSetting: Dinner with a friend, Monday 08/22/2011.  We were lucky they had a 2-top available, as it was MAGIC week.\n\nThumbs Up: You can't go wrong by leaving it up to the chef (omakase in Japanese restaurants).  But if not, must gets are: the octopus (so tender, crisp, and yummy); Milos special (eggplant and cucumber chips w/ tzatziki sauce [make sure to mix it up and dig out the tzatziki as it cuts through the saltiness]); cooked whole fish (we had red snapper, and was very fresh and delicious); service staff if very helpful - don't be shy to ask any questions, and even take a tour of the fish being displayed.  Their service staff had good recommendations on wine pairings w/ the different seafood dishes.\n\nThumbs Down:  Nothing.\n\nTip: Most of the bad reviews are a result of not being seated for a 2-top.  This is a family style restaurant where most tables seat 4 or more.  Try to come with more than 2 people and you'll be seated much faster."
27092,3,"Mama-Mia-American-Pizzeria is alrighty for Jungleboy.\n\nThe place is a jolly, colourful, multilevel building with alcoves and indoor window gaps. They have personally painted the walls with a  surrealistic piece depicting flying mushrooms, chili-pepper butterflies and a Pepperoni-Man saving the day. Funny!\n\nWe sat down on a table for two and we ordered our pizza - 9\"" with 3 toppings - I got pepperoni, mushrooms and chili-peppers (was I subliminally influenced by the painting? Yes I was..) It was a very well filled pizza and very tasty.\n\nI enjoyed the pizza crust, which I normally don't(!) and appreciated the laid back, but precise way of serving. They enquired if we were OK, we got our drinks served in time and we got to take the left over slices with us. \n\nI did find it a bit cold near the doors and I had a good view of all the people on the outside who peered in to see what this place is like. I made an effort to smile and wave to many of them to show how  good it was - but somehow the peepers backed away from the windows very quick when I did that. \n\nRecommend for a quick visit or even a nice afternoon late snack / meal with a bunch of friends or family, they had a cartwheel of a pizza available to serve to a big table of 8 - it was huge!"
38458,2,"Bonne place pour prendre un verre avec des amis tout en d\u00e9gustant une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de tapas japonais. Service press\u00e9 et parfois un peu froid, sauf lorsque vient le temps de prendre un SAK\u00c9 BOMB (\u00e0 essayer)! Noter que le prix d\u00e9passe facilement la cote $$ (30$) si vous avez une bonne faim."
8318,4,"By far, the freshest fish to be found anywhere  - Toyama is a gem - and Chef Owner Mo is very accomodating, and has a great sense of humor. His hand rolls and specials are some of the best in town.\n\nFor a true live experience, I do recommend sitting at the bar as the sushi chefs are quite talkative and very knowledgeable about their trade.\n\nRecommended specials: Toyama roll, orange cup tuna, seasoned squid salad.\n\nService: best at the bar - dining room staff is attentie, yet inconsistent and more often than not - just plain aloof! If you want to sit in fron of Mo at the bar, just make sure you arrive there plenty early."
34287,3,"We went on a Thursday night, which happened to be open mike night.  It was packed!  We barely found a spot at the bar.  The place itself is quite large with lots of different 'areas' to hang out in.  The open mike night was a lot of fun and I'm glad we happened upon it.  Even our bartender got up to sing and he was awesome... probably the most talented of all the brave souls playing that night!\n\nDrinks are really quite cheap and it wasn't even happy hour time.  Also every time a fire truck goes by (its adjacent to the fire department) drinks are $1 for fifteen minutes!  Pretty cool and appropriate special that they have enacted! The wings were actually quite good... at least crispy and not completely lathered in sauce.  \n\nDefinitely more of a dive bar with random posters etc all over the walls and no frills to speak of but its also not that ghetto or intimidating.  It definitely suites a younger crowd and has bands playing there regularly.  \n\nOverall a really nice and necessary alternative to Mill Ave.... Tempe needs more bars like this!"
23924,1,"I purchased unlimited and I should've brought the one use pass the rides were ok. Great view however, the rides wasn't scary I'm and adrenaline junky and I love roller coasters but these rides didn't do it for me"
5536,3,"Saw this on diners drive in and dives and the very next day I was standing in line in 100 degree heat to try some BBQ. \n\nBe prepared to sweat a bit even though they offer free lemonade while you wait! The \""restaurant\"" is more like an outdoor BBQ. You order and pay and they pull your order from the grill and call your name.  It's pretty simple really. \n\nYou can buy Tshirts if you wish, Or order cuts of meat from inside. It's a small room and kind of dungeon like but a lot of people were ordering so it must be good as well. The butcher is right there for you to watch. \n\nWe shared a 3 meat combo...ribs which were super tender, brisket that melted in my mouth with flavor and the hot link. Man oh man the hot link...I loved it. Perfectly cooked with a kick that keeps you wanting more. \n\nWe had Mac n cheese and potato salad for sides. Both were fresh and very good. The Mac was so cheesy! \n\nIt's located in a neighborhood and it's close to is so we will be returning when we get that BBQ craving. It's a must if you are visiting!!!"

15563,3,"This is is FANTASTIC!!!\n\nIt is much more than I expected, with a story and many characters. \nWe went with 3 adults and 1 senior and had a GREAT time. Nonstop laughs and impressive animals. I will see this show again soon!\n\nMost of the animals in the show seemed to genuinely enjoy the attention :)\n\nI HIGHLY suggest that you see it.

20861,3,"As my boyfriend and I was walking around the food court in the Metro Center Mall, one of the employees in front of Charley's Grilled Subs handed us a sample of their special limited time offer Chicken Sub (I don't see the exact name on their online menu).  After we tried a bite, we knew we were getting one.  :D  I guess the employee noticed our smile of approval so she handed us each a coupon to save $0.50 a sub.  Woot!  :)\n\nThe service was fast and subs were prepared as they were being ordered.  The regular french fries were really tasty.  Humorously packed in a cup, too!  :D"
19979,1,"The service sucks. The entrances are weird and confusing. Employees look angry and unapproachable. They do make good hummus, pitas are dry thoughbut my husband and I would rather go elsewhere."

21219,1,"Expensive compared to other thai restaurants. Service is bad. Run away if your server is \""Yok\"". She scares me."
4548,2,No bad room. Ideal size for two people with king size bed.  Looking forward to show tonight. Clean with plenty of amenities.
29407,1,"While the name and concept is really eye catching, the food does not live up to par. Food is really heavy, rich, and greasy-almost like fast food type and for what you get, it's pretty expensive. Wait is long and service is not that great, and even then youll probably end up being seated outside in the cold.\n\n For starters, my friends and i ordered the onion ring tower. It comes out stacked beautifully with dipping sauces of ranch and such, and was actually pretty good-probably the best part of the entire meal. For my main entree I ordered the truffle mac and cheese ($14). The dish was decent, but nothing too memorable, just a bunch of cheese mixed into some pasta, which I couldn't even finish because it was just too rich after a couple of bites. High heel pump sandwich ($16) is HUGE, but it's also a got so much going on in it it that it becomes a big sloppy mess to eat. My friend ordered the ABC burger which she said was good, but nothing great that would make her come back for it again, especially for $16.50. Maybe this place is better left for desserts. I've heard good things about their frozen hot chocolate selections so next time I'm here, Ill definitely try that instead."
736,0,"I was a loyal customer of this Discount Tire up until this week. They replaced a wheel for me in 2013 following a car accident. They offered me a hubcap, but I wanted it to match the others, so I was very explicit with them that I would be purchasing a factory hubcap. When I purchased the first hubcap off ebay, it didn't fit properly on the wheel, and I assumed I had purchased the wrong hubcap by mistake.\n\nIn May, when GM recalled my car, I ordered a factory hubcap through my dealer to make sure it was right this time. When that one didn't fit, I realized the wheel was the problem. When I called Discount Tire, they said of course it doesn't fit, you have one of our stock wheels on. Had it been explained to me that the wheel wouldn't fit the hubcap I was VERY clear that I wanted, I never would have purchased it!\n\nThey assured me this would be fixed, and that they would not only order me the correct wheel, but would take off the cost of the wheel I had already purchased. I gave them a month, and called back to inquire as to the status of my order. They explained that they  had placed the order, but since they ordered it from the factory, they were waiting on GM to ship it. I got the same story again in July, and August. When I called again this month, I was told that they didn't have an order for me out at all, there was no note on my account about any of this, and they had no idea what I was talking about. I either fell through the cracks, or someone decided I simply wasn't worth the trouble or the money I had spent there.\n\nI am livid, and will never give this location another dime. I contacted another discount tire, and they got me a new wheel by the next business day, no hassle!"
34477,3,"Super close to our house, they had a Salted Carmel yogurt that was redonkulously good.  Tons of toppings (including WHOLE pieces of Kit kats and Swiss Bars!?

45311,1,"I was very much looking forward to a nice dinner out with my husband, and Ruth's Chris seemed to be a good choice given all of the hype I'd heard about it from friends who had visited other locations.\n\nWhen we were seated, our server poured our waters and managed to get some in the glass as the ice chunks splashed puddles onto our tablecloth.  Our server was nice enough, but not extremely attentive overall.\n\nI ordered a bottle of wine, and 10 minutes later was presented a different bottle of wine. I decided to keep that bottle because I have enjoyed it before and I didn't want to wait for another bottle.  Once our glasses were poured, it was another 20-ish minutes before the server came to check on us again- I ended up pouring my own wine because I didn't want to wait any longer.\n\nMy husband (Vegetarian) had the terrific option (sarcasm meter going off) of choosing any 3 sides. Come on RC, a $50/plate restaurant can't keep some pasta noodles in the pantry and throw together a nice veggie and pasta dish? I understand we were at a steak house, but it would have been nice to provide an option other than a bunch of sides disguised as an entree.\n\nMy \""medium\"" steak came out well done, and the wrong veggies were delivered with my husband's 'entree'.  Fortunately they fixed the error quickly, but given the series of errors, it was beginning to get ridiculous.\n\nEventually the manager walked by who was very kind and pleasant to speak with.  He seemed genuinely concerned about our satisfaction and apologized for the many errors we endured.\n\nAs we waited for our check, our server brought over a piece of chocolate cake with \""Thank you\"" written in chocolate, as an apology from the manager.  Now this cake, was probably one of the most amazing desserts I have ever eaten.  Very rich, very decadent, and enough for two of us to easily share- the cake, was the stuff dreams are made of!  I wanted to come back to the restaurant later that evening just to get another piece of that cake (I didn't do it- but the thought genuinely crossed my mind!).  That gesture of good will has changed my mind from a \""will never return\"" to a \""we might give RC a second chance after all.\"""
27897,4,"Best.time.ever! We did the Black Canyon horseback riding experience that included a BBQ. Our guide, Aaron, was a REAL cowboy! Loved it! Spent over 20 years handling horses from CO to AZ and back. He had on his cowboy hat, boots with spurs, plaid shirt with Marlboro reds in his pocket, and Wrangler jeans. My son was so happy at the authentic experience. He got to shoot a real pistol, lasso, throw a tomahawk, etc. Did you know they have a Cowboy camp? Yep. Awesome.\nThey offer the same experience in Sedona, so we can't wait to try that one."
7587,1,This restaurant was recommended to me.  I just wasn't that impressed.  Went for lunch on Sunday.  The place was empty except for one other couple that came in as we were getting ready to leave.  \n\nThe service was really bad.  We were ignored for about 5 minutes after coming in and sitting down.  Our drinks and food were all served promplty  but with no smile or friendliness.\n\nThe menu was a list of specials hanging all over the walls.  The only vegetarian option was Green Curry so I ordered that.  The soup came out first and had brown curly noodles in it as well as chunks of small brown pieces of chicken.  Two of my kids liked it but I couldn't try it.  Lunch was served with fried rice instead of white or brown and I wasn't a fan of that.  The egg roll also had meat so I couldn't try that.\n\nMy girls shared the chicken teriyaki and were not impressed.  The fried pieces of wonton were the most popular part of the meal.  My son had the red beef curry and enjoyed it.  So did my husband.\n\nI won't be back.
48847,0,"I'm a pretty easy going guy and appreciate a local barbershop.   I hate chains and like to patronize the local guy who busts his hump opening up a new business.  Clearly this is a \""2\"" location and the \""first\"" Boss Barber shop must have be successful in order to open up another location.  I am always on the lookout for a new barber that is closer to home.  I was excited when this opened up and was next to my gym and much closer to home then my other great barber.\n\nYou have to think each month me and my two boys will get our hair cut, so I would think that's some good business. I think I tip pretty well - $5 on a haircut.  You would also think that I know at least a few guys who need haircuts and shaves locally, and my fellow gym rats would hear about my new great Barber experience.\n\nSo when I walk into your place, midweek after a workout, why wouldn't you ask me if I needed help?  \nWhy would I just stand there for 2-3 minutes?   \n\nTwo guys were working there.  \n\nOne was cutting someone and the other guy was clearly on his cell phone on a personal call.  Unless that call was 1) Your parole officer, 2) Your mother in the hospital, or 3) Publisher's Clearing House telling you, you just won a bunch of FU money - I think you could notice me and say, \""Hey man, can I help you? Or \""Hey I'll be with you in one second\"" and wrap up your phone call.   If it was an important call - couldn't the guy cutting hair pause for a second and walk over to greet me with the same type of response?\n\nI dunno.  I was interested in a cut and a shave.  \n\nMaybe some of you fellow Yelpers think I'm being a hard a$$ or maybe I'm just \""old school\"" and think a personal cell call takes second place to a new customer, walking into a new business, but I don't think so.   \nI'm in sales.  Customers matter.  New customers are tough to acquire. Put your cell phone down and deal with it another time.\n\nOh well...I guess I'll never know if you were good or worthy of my business."
22117,1,"NOT BAD. BUT NOT GOOD EITHER.\n\nPROS: It's located inside the Cabo Wabo Cantina on the second floor. If you are hungry, you have what looks like a pretty decent restaurant on the main floor. When you make your way up the stairs, the venue itself is pretty decent size with a full bar for you alcoholics. The view from there is pretty awesome. You can see right below you the strip and a clear view of the Bellagio fountains across the street.\n\nCONS: The elevator was out of order that night we went. What if you were handicapped? How the heck are you suppose to make it up the second floor? Anyways that was just a minor thing compared to the major issue. Since the restaurant is right below us, all the noise coming from there was echoing up the stairs to the venue. So sometimes you couldnt fully understand what the comedians were saying. The mics were turned up pretty good already but the fact that you have constant background noise from downstairs greatly reduces this review to 2 stars. Fix that and you are at least a 4 stars.\n\nAs for the comedians, there is a new set every week so this review does not pertain to them. The venue is what is always constant so that is what you will be dealing with, thus this review will tell what to expect atmospherewise."
9646,2,I stayed here over the Labor Day Weekend...I upgraded to the newer room.  The room was small.  The two beds were not Queens. They were Full size.  Me and the family are not small people.  It was very uncomfortable.  I liked the price.  I love gambling here.  But I would not stayed with a lot of people.  They cater to an older crowd and families...
30818,0,"I hate writing this review.  I was so looking forward to trying Lazy Joe's.\n\nI went in hungry, in a good mood and wanting fish and chips.\n\nVery nice girl at the counter and the owner cooking.  I ordered the 2 piece cod platter and a side of onion rings.  \n\nThe main problem is that everything comes coated in this bland, pale batter.  A good fish batter should cook up golden brown or darker, be crunchy and add flavor to the food.  The pale, tan concoction that was on the fish and onion rings was flavorless and just looked ugly.  I tried to dunk my fish in the tartar sauce, but the batter fell apart.  Then tried cutting with knife and fork, same problem,  crumbled into bits.  Now I know your probably thinking I waited too long to eat it.  Wrong, I ate the fish within 5 minutes of it being prepared.\n\nSo until a new batter is used,  I will have to stay away."
6559,2,"Jolly Bob's was... okay.\n\nCame here for dinner yesterday and found that the bar was extremely crowded, and blocked off the dining area. I was not greeted by anyone, I needed to get the attention of someone to ask to be put on a list.\n\nIt took over half an hour to get seated. Was served bread reasonably quickly and service once seated was actually decent overall. Bread was good and fresh, Salad was also very good. Then the entrees came. \n\nI got the Avo Cat, which itself was good, but not great for its price. The accompaniments were also just... okay. Rice was particularly dry. Some of my dining companions had food was also merely okay (4oz mahi mahi for 13.50?, dry chicken in a curry dish?)\n\nWhen it was time to take the bill, the server couldn't be bothered to split the cash only bill. \n\nI may come back again some time for drinks, as what my companions had were quite good, but I'm not so sure I'd come back for dinner again."
25835,2,Nice drink menu and a great balcony with a view of the city. Much better than the club/pub options down the street. Very trendy vibe but worth it to avoid loud club beats on a weekend!
27388,3,Stumbled into this place while walking around the Grassmarket area looking for a place to eat.  It is a very small store with some interesting old books.  Take your time to browse around.  The gentleman behind the counter is also very friendly.  I bought a couple of old Dickens books from 1900 for 7 GBP each.
46815,0,"How ridiculous, soft opening? Looked at website after I got there, it says they open at 4pm and sign on door says they open at 5pm. They need to figure this out, maybe I'll think about coming back. But with the reviews so far, doesn't seem like anyone should bother to waste time and money."
41424,0,"My date and I had a dinner reservation on Saturday at 9 at FnB so we decided to get a drink before at R+D, right across the street. I understand this isn't a place that you just pop in and out of so we got to the dumpster and called at 7:45. One group of 4 was in front of us, and we were told 20 minutes to wait. That was expected, so we hung out and waited. The foursome was let in about 20 minutes after we arrived, and we anticipated we should get in shortly. After a 45 minute wait we decided to go across the street to make sure we got to have a drink somewhere before our meal. Would have loved to try it, sounds fun, but the wait was absolutely ridiculous."
39994,0,"Received rubber flooring rolls and upon unrolling them noticed they were not laying flat along one edge (all three). The rolls were obviously defective and were a liability to the gym members-- a tripping hazard. Members were calling them the new \""bacon\"" mats because of the waves along the edges. After providing the company with photos and expressing my disapointment, Alex was very understanding and told me the issue would be resolved within 48 hours. After 48 hours , his tone changed, avoiding my emails, giving vague answers, and even blaming me for installing them improperly. It has been a week since I've heard from them and have lodged a complaint with American Express."
37894,0,"I love tapas and not only is my best friend a chef at the blue ribbon sushi grill but I also had a friend who works at jaleo so I went on a recommendation from them both. \n\nMe and another girlfriend went to jaleo for dinner and all I can say is the service that we got from some white guy named Brian was horrible. We understand that being in the cosmo it was busy but he did not once ask us how the food was, and was too busy with the couple next to us. He was too occupied with getting more money out of that couple than giving us decent service. Our food came out relatively fast but everything that came out was bland. By the end of our meal we were craving some flavor, hoping to get dessert.. It took us 20 minutes to get our check and not only that he didn't even offer us a dessert menu.\n\nWe had gotten the shrimp al ajillo, the chicken fritters, the chorizo wrapped in potato, and the tuna salad. All were bland and the portions were minuscule to almost non existent. I know tapas are meant to be small, but jaleo took it to the next level.\n\nI was furious when I left, the food was sub-par and the service was ridiculous. I would have complained to the manager if I wasn't in such a hurry to get out of the godforsaken place. I will never go back to jaleo, I'd rather go to firelfy where the service is decent to amazing and the food is always out of this world. After leaving we were asked where we had dinner that night and both me & my girlfriend blanked. The service was that horrible that we both couldn't even remember the name of the restaurant."
815,1,Wow.  What a bunch of stoners.
23800,2,"I've been to Mido Sushi several times and always had the best of experiences.  Their happy hour is very affordable albeit a bit of a drag that only the Saki is 1/2 off and not any beer.  Nonetheless, the food has always been tasty and an extra treat with the small salad and edamame appetizers that come to each table.  Chance the server is also excellent and a pleasure.  \n\nWhat has drug the star count down from 5 to 3 is my last visit for a Saturday happy hour ended up with me 3 hours later puking on Chandler Blvd at a stop light.  No doubt it was food poisoning that lasted a few hours.  I'm not a big fan of vomiting especially from bad food.  \n\nI realize that you take certain risks when eating sushi but in a nutshell............ bad fish just CAN'T HAPPEN!  \n\nTo reiterate, I've eaten at this establishment many times with no ill affects and loved it but...........eater beware."
40375,0,"This company was a nightmare to work with. They initially started the work on the pool replaster and spa addition promptly, in order to collect the first two payments, but that is when the work pretty much stopped. Nothing got done for weeks. When work was done, it was unsupervised, and thus some things needed to be redone multiple times to get them done right, such as moving the PVC pipe covered utilities away from the pool, where the workers had placed them sticking 3 feet up from the ground, right next to the spa. It took two times before they placed behind the fountain where they could not be seen. They also had problems tiling the fountain backsplash, and when they had to tear it up, they put all their garbage in my recycling bin. Fortunately I noticed it, as I am sure I would have been fined by city of Scottsdale  had I not. He very reluctantly came to empty the can, and seemed to think it was quite unreasonable for me to ask for him to do that. The last straw was when they dug the gas line. He did not supervise or use a locator service and when I returned from my trip, I found power outages all aver the house. Turned out that they had hit an electrical conduit, and damaged it so severely that it pulled wires out of the wall on a sub panel. Then instead of owning up to it, they covered it up. Bill of course was right there trying to collect his final bill before this damage was discovered. I refused to pay it at the time because the yard was left a total mess. When he saw the electricians in the yard, he was acting very nervous, and told them that they did not  do anything. It took 3 electricians hours to locate the damage, and when they did, he refused to take any responsibility initially what so ever. I however had all the proof I needed, and eventually he paid about $1,300.00 of a $2,100.00 bill. If you are thinking of getting any pool work done, stay away from this company!\nAnita C."
26081,1,"Place is small, you can sit outside... In this heat, no thanks.\n\nService was BAD. We had to ask multiple times for things. My fiance had plastic,\n\nYES PLASTIC in his water.\n\nFood, is mehh. We've had better.\n\nMy 5 month old daughter was with us, and her outfit had gotten messy while we were there, so I took her in the bathroom, and changed her, without making a scene. However, I had a mommy brain fart, and forgot to pack a second outfit.\n\nIt was a week day, and the place was NOT busy. So, because I knew that we were just waiting for dessert and the check, I walked out with her in a blanket and her diaper. \n\nThe waitress just had to ask why my baby was \""naked.\"" Making it seem like I was an unfit parent. Almost drawing attention to our table. Making us very uncomfortable.\n\nWe couldn't get out of there fast enough."
32373,2,"THE place to try in Montreal for a touristy taste of poutine. 25+ different types on the menu. Very busy all year round with locals and tourists alike. Yes, there are better poutines out there but there's only one La banquise. So do try it and make your own opinion of it. You'll like it or you won't but at least it'll be a 'check' on your list of things-to-try-in-Montreal!"
40914,3,"Good food and beer selection. Service is hit or miss, so I wouldn't suggest going in if you are in a rush! Menu is great, I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like. The Veggie Panini, Caprese Chicken Sandwich or any of the flatbreads are my favorite. I always get a side of ranch if I get fries, the peppercorn ranch is awesome! Lots of TVs for game viewing, and a really nice patio space. One of the better restaurants in Tempe Marketplace, worth checking out!"
1604,1,"I made it to Guiseppe's only after a friend had seen it on the Food Network.  I'd heard of it before, but hadn't ever felt like making the trek out here from Glendale.  On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.\n\n\nYes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.\n\nThere was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.\n\nThe place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.\n\nThe food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.\n\nBut in the end, the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall \""meh\"" dining experience."
4188,3,Spent two nights here for a family event.  Since I love older resorts and historical sites this type of hotel was a perfect choice. Check in was quick and getting a roll away bed was no problem. The grounds are well kept and the style Territorial or SW is so charming.  The pool we visited was the kid-friendly one that has two waterslides.  The ONLY exception to the stellar customer service however occurred at the pool. Our server was a very young (16?) girl who took our drink order and disappeared for 25 minutes. Keep in mind that it is at this point 103 degrees in the shade. And she didn't seem to be busy at all as we could see her from where we were sitting.  My husband noted that many hotels and resorts now include a 20 percent gratuity automatically and that it was unfortunate because servers aren't incentivized to provide a good customer experience.   Finally he got up and walked over to the bar and simply asked the bartender for his drink. The young girl seemed to disappear as he walked up. A few minutes later my husband had his  drink and returned to our spot at the pool when a more mature server (Christine maybe?) greeted us and apologized for her coworkers lack of service. She was from Chicago as is my husband and they chatted for a moment. Later we confirmed that the 20 gratuity was not included but that younger server was probably not well-suited for her job.
31654,0,"Generally I won't write reviews for meh meals, and Cabo Wabo certainly qualified.  However they just added a new policy that earns them 1 yelp star, hidden pricing, yea deception.  They charge you a hidden \""CNF\"" fee, which is nothing but bull.  If you want to charge more for you food, fine, go ahead and post it on the menu, don't try and hide it with some lame hidden fee.  Cabo Wabo deserves a full boycot for this sleezy tactic.  I will never patronize any establishment that uses hidden fees, and tell others to do the same.  Makes no sense, this is nothing but a another management fail."
46446,2,"I am giving this place a three stars because I dine at a lot of Thai restaurants. The quality of the food is good, but it is overprice for the portion that you receive. This is however typical when it is located on the upper scale side of town. \n\nHowever, it does not have me going for more unless I am in the area and feel like eating Thai food. Even then, I would probably go to Bangkok Ocha!"
15619,0,"Brunch is one of the worst I have ever had in my life.  I paid $8 for a salad that I ate in 3 bites.  I am serious, and I am not a fatty.  I also ordered a mimosa, which was overly pulpy and had a bad strawberry in it, and a super bland bloody mary after telling the waiter I like a spicy bloody.  Our service was horrible too.  It was impossible to ever get our disappearing waiter to serve us.  Disappointing considering I ate dinner here like 5 years ago and it was decent.  This place is an overpriced joke."
5328,3,"One of the top tier Hampton's we have stayed at, and we have been to a lot of them across the USA.  Quiet, comfortable, and great breakfast with ample eating area.  Within easy walk of The Strip.  The only Hampton with a full bar and slots for those who want to leave a little money in Vegas.  Highly recommend."

41407,1,Did a so so job. Expensive for the clumpy lashes I got. I've had far better lashes since.
22596,4,"Nothing wrong with this place, it's relatively cheap compared to just about anywhere on the strip (well it's not exactly on it, it's inside the Excalibur hotel on the upper level where the shops are). The food had good taste and it felt good to eat something that wasn't fast food. My wife and I had two coffees, breakfast and a side of beans we shared it because they gived you a lot and everything was about 13 dollars and we still could not finish everything. Highly recommend it!"

30922,1,"This is not the place for Italian food.  It is a pretty generic Americanized Italian food chain joint but if you ever want Beignets, come here and order the zappolis... They call them Italian doughnuts but they are basically just beignets with chocolate dipping sauce and are great!  Other than that... I sat at the bar and the bartender was super sweet and nice, his name?? but the check said \""khutso C.\""  Sooo, I think his name may have been Chris?? He was great, the staff at the bar were very friendly and cool but there were two guys at the door when I came in that had an attitude problem... I walked in and said I was going to the bar and they stood there looking at me like \""whatever!\""?? I mean... Come on, they didn't even have to seat me, thus do their job, so what was up with the shitty looks?  While I was waiting I tried the crispy asparagus app and it was good except it came with this heavy sauce.. I asked for balsamic instead and it was much better!! Also I have to say they had no problem with me using my small vaporizer at the bar and Chris and the other bartender even complimented me on it;) love a vape friendly bar!! All in all, for a chain the bar is great but if you want Italian food this isn't the place... It's like any other national chain, pretty Americanized!  Chris and the other cool bartender should be working somewhere high-end, they were the best part of the visit!;)"
47981,1,"Probably the best ramen restaurant in the University of Waterloo plaza.\nIt is not as good as the Kenzo Ramen restaurant in downtown Toronto, lacks flavour.\nThe price is high for the quality. \nYou cannot wait in line inside of the restaurant, therefore you have to wait outside because there is usually a line of 5 of more people waiting. (Not comfortable in the winter).\nThe credit/debit card machine does not work.\nService was fast.\nThe restaurant appeared to be run by Koreans rather than Japanese people. So its not legit ramen.\nWill probably not go often, I would rather have ramen in Toronto, where the quality justifies the price."

23587,4,"This was my first timeshare experience.  My good friend invited me to stay with her.  If you don't feel like being out on the strip around all the drunken people.  This is great for a peaceful Vegas alternative.  I noticed a lot of families on the property.  \n\nWhat you get: a room, Air Conditioning, Full functional kitchen, washer and dryer, fireplace, BBQ and 2 TVs.  Not bad.  Oh, now lets talk about the amenities.  Outside are 4 swimming pools and a couple of hot tubs.  There is a gym and recreation room.  You can borrow DVDs to watch.  A mini market in the middle of the property, that serves Starbucks.\n\nShuttle service.  Runs on the hour, takes you to the Monte Carlo.  From there if you need to get further down the strip, I suggest walking across the street to MGM and catching the rail.  Faster than taking a bus on the strip.  Once a day, there is another shuttle that takes you to Vons grocery store.  I hit up the Taco Bell in the same shopping complex and some groceries.  Lastly, they provide you with an airport shuttle number if you ask, which cost me $9, rather than a taxi ride.  Awesome!!!!"
23180,1,"HAPPY and FAT. \n\nThe operative words that come to mind when I hear the name Mario Batali. Sadly, the overpriced, lackluster fare at Carnevino only made me the latter! But, as a disclaimer, it has been quite a while since my visit here, so hopefully they've made some improvements since then. \n\nLocated in The Palazzo, Carnevino semi-failed from the get-go. While it maintains the top-notch customer service and decadent, chic decor expected of a high-end Vegas establishment, the ambience was marred by the raucous sound of Beastie Boys blarring from the stereo system. I'm not neccessarily opposed to them, but the likes of \""Intergalatic\"" and \""Sabatoge\"" didn't jive well with the up-scale environment.  \n\nThe menu was sneaky too. So, watch out! Case in point, the prices listed for the pastas range from $17-$31; however, these are for appetizer portions only. An additional $15 needs to be tacked on for the entree size. Also, the steak for two is listed as $72, but it's $72 PER PERSON, making it a whopping $144.  A steak legitimately worth that much wouldn't be for eating, as it should be plated in precious metals and embedded with Swarvoski crystals.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Bison Carpaccio & Fried Calamari appetizers, 16-oz bone-in New York strip, Grilled Sweetbreads, & Pork Milanese. Pretty much all the main courses failed, and for an establishment that boasts \""the highest-quality, excellently prepared steaks\"" I was seriously expecting more than the the chewy, bland New York strip that was served. The appetizers were actually pretty good, and I'd recommend getting the Bison Capaccio. But other than that, the highlights of the meal were the complimentary cheese puffs & the bread w/butter & peppered lard. \n\nNeedless to say, this was a sad way to start out our trip in Vegas. Luckily, our night of debauchery at XS later on that night made up for it. Two stars!"

My biggest issue to the damn place is old and renovation are due. Kill some seats even if it means losing revenue. Booking the show in that is a bad venue. Some seating will be ok for place some other will not, it's so freaking random!"
20014,2,Typical mall but a bit over priced and not geared towards locals. Definetly a tourist trap mall but still has a few nice specialty shops and occasionally a good sale here or there. The coffee bean here is awesome and the mall has free yoga on sundays at lululemon so thats a plus as well.
25137,4,Incredible!  Very friendly service and wonderful food.  My husband and I tried the brown stew chicken and the oxtail.  Both excellent!  Prices were very inexpensive for the quality and quantity of food.  A must try!
48510,1,"Naming the place Taco Haus prepared my palette for a taco experience. Especially since it replaced Blue Burrito.  But that's not what I had. It's almost like the chef wants to be a clever alchemist but fails. Tom Jetland he is not.\n\nI had two tacos. One chicken. One carne asade. The chicken one had no flavor except I could taste the corn tortilla.. The steak one tasted like the steak had been marinated in Worcestershire sauce, which was unpleasant. I dressed them both up with guacamole and salsa (I had to ask for and they were extra). I hated the lunch.\n\nThe place looks like it would be a great happy hour--inside has picnic table style seating, built to be lined up with butts from the frat house on Saturday night. There's a lot of seating outside too, which would be a fun happy hour.\n\nService was slow, although there seemed to be a lot of servers. My friend and I paid $30 for our lunch, left and went to McDonalds to get ice cream cones to cleanse our palettes from a lunch we are trying to forget. He had ceviche, by the way, and was more than underwhelmed.\n\nI am happy to read that some of these reviews of Taco Haus are so glowing. Maybe I caught them on an off day but somehow, I don't think so. I am a total foodie and this is one place I would not recommend.\n\nBut what I will recommend to Taco Haus:  write a little blurb about your style and philosophy on the menus so customers understand they're not getting a taco that their palette might be craving.\n\nI'll give them two stars because it appears they have a wide selection of tequilas. After enough tequila, anything tastes good, right?"
17504,0,"Words can not express how terrible this was for me. I live close to this \""salon\"", and thought I would check it out. I used to work in a casino, so I had odd days off. I think I went in on a Tuesday or Wednesday .... Around ten or eleven...\n\nFirst off the place was a ghost town. I think there was one other customer there, getting her nails done..... I asked the receptionist  for an eyebrow wax, and a pedicure. She rudely told me how \""lucky\"" I was that there where staff to help me today. The front lobby has chairs, but is over whelmed by the amount of junk that they are trying to sell....fold out tables full of jewelry, purses, hair products and what not. \n\nI felt like I was in a flea market... To me, salons should sell two or three things..... Nail polish, shampoo, and possibly skin care.... So it doesn't come off so.... garage sale like.\n\nThe wax lady did my eyebrows UN believably thin. Scary thin. I've seen newborn babies with more eyebrows then what she thought \""fit my face.\"".  During my wax, all she could do was talk about the depressed lady in her apartments that she thought was going to commit suicide...... Awkward.\n\nNext came my pedicure.... When asked if I wanted my nails clipped, I said only a little, because my nails do not grow, and I usually just get them filed. She hacked off my nail on my big toe. There was so much skin to nail ratio... It looked like my big toe had a muffin top. On the little nails that she did file..... She filed the skin to the point where it burned. \n\nShe also had long blonde hair, that she did not tie back during my treatment... And she was shedding on ME. When she was rubbing the lotion into my legs, I could feel her hair rubbing into my skin. She took her grotesque nails and peeled it off of my legs.  Which he thought was quite amusing, because she giggled when she did it. Can you say unprofessional?\n\nDisgusting. And never, ever again."
3739,3,"My favorite Mongolian BBQ joint in the Phoenix area. HUGE HUGE portions, the only place where they let you smash the meat with wax paper, so much sauce and even the side bar is delicious. DO IT and I dare you to finish everything in your bowl."
15725,1,"My boyfriend and I wanted to go soem where and try some thing new so we made the choice to dine at zinks because a couple of people said that it was good and we had to go. WHAT A BIG LET DOWN. We started off with the lamb lollipops and the crab cake (yes it was only one). The lamb lollipops where extremly salty and the crab cake was dry like it had been cooked to long. Then we had the lettece wedge salad when enough dressing to cover like on leaf of lettece. On to the main course I had the hailbate and he had salmon and it was bland and something that could have made. On top of that I had to keep asking for them to refill my water. Its a really classy, nice, place with a wonderful atmospher   but its over rated."
11191,4,"I wish I lived in Vegas so I could come here as much as I wanted.  Joey's serves the best pizza in Vegas and aren't overpriced to boot!\nIf you go there, just know anything on the pizza menu is solid.  Joey's has excellent crust and the standard tomato and alfredo sauces.  I prefer the Double Bacon Hamburger pizza myself, but I will try everything hopefully when I head back up to Vegas.  Also they have the best appertizers called garlic balls.  They are small bits of dough that are covered in garlic and butter.  I am not sure if they are fried, or baked, but they were so good.  Beyond good, they were excellent!"
16819,2,"Typical Vegas bar: Beautiful girls serving expensive drinks.  Happily, however, they don't torture you too much with Beatles music.  It is VERY small and located behind the casino - so don't waste your time if you aren't staying here."
46471,2,Kinnaree is a 3.5 for me based on a few reasons. It was very dark in the restaurant; the yellow curry was too sweet and watery; the pad kee mao was pretty bland.\n\nI will still be back because I like the fact that they have brown rice and the quality of food is good.
37402,2,"I have been to a few Newk's cafe's locations so I know what to expect going here for lunch.  Because this location is near my office, I have patronized this Uptown site numerous times.  To me, Newk's Uptown feels like a smaller space than the other sites I have been to.  Nothing like the Newk's I visited in Springfield, MS (probably the best laid out one that I have ever been to) but similar to the one in Greensboro, NC.\n\nAtmosphere - Located in a former restaurant/ night club (same three or so steps to go up from the main entrance) the feel here is busy, noisy, more tables than booths, informal, messy (always feels like you just arrived after a lunch rush), fast casual order and delivery process.\n\nFood - Lots of choices that include sandwiches (toasted), salads, soups and pizza.  I usually get the chicken speciality sandwich, with ice tea and fruit.  This sandwich comes with grilled chicken applewood smoked bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, olive oil, mayo and Honey Mustard on a decent in texture baguette.  I get this when I want to eat healthy by dropping the swiss cheese, mayo and honey mustard.  \n\nWhen I want to eat something that has a lot of flavor, I get the Italian.  It has capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami, provolone cheese, mayo, spicy creole mustard, lettuce, tomato, yellow onions, hot cherry peppers and Italian sauce.  While I do drop the mayo...just don't like it...this sandwich is still a  calorie and flavor indulgence.  \n\nService - It is good for a place that takes your order, gives you a number, a cup, a tray, and then makes you wait for the food to arrive.  On my several visits here everyone has been friendly (even when there is a mistake) and the place is always jammed.\n\nOverall - An okay, option for lunch in Uptown.  With drink you are over $10, which some have deemed pricy.  But when you think about about it, a Chick-fil-a combo is only a buck or two below that price and they don't bring it to your table.  \n\nTips:  \n* Reinforce any special order requests as the staff has gotten it wrong in the past.\n* During lunch, grab a table ASAP after ordering as they can vanish quickly!"
23053,3,San Felipe's is a really fun atmosphere. It's great for happy hour (2.50 flat tires!-and many more specials) The hostesses were very friendly and helpful and the servers were great too! My friend and I went for happy hour and then decided to get a table to eat. We waited a little but the server was super nice and brought us out free chips and salsa and a brownie sundae dessert! I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a fun and social atmosphere. It gets pretty crowded for happy hour and the weekends but all the better to mingle and meet new people! The food was good too!
22185,0,Went to this place while on vacation in Tempe. Place looked chill from the outside and we were starving so my friends and I decided to check it out. The salsa tasted like someone put a jar of oregano in it. It was awful! I ordered a Carnitas burrito. I had to ask them to add beans and rice to a 10 dollar burrito. I was like what the hell?? Asked them to put green sauce on it as well. It was sooo bland and boring. Green sauce had no spice or flavor. Would not recommend this place. Crappy and overpriced. My friends dish was also very bland. Should of went to Del Taco. The good side was that the Staff was friendly..
4293,2,"Whataburger has a decent burger, but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food. This location hasn't been too busy on the few occasions that I have dined here though, so it has been quick and convenient for me."
43119,4,"It's Vegas. People are already walking outside. It's kinda crowded and it's only about 830AM. I was hesitant to see all the people standing inside but I needed to get something quick and simple for my boyfriend.\n\nLet me tell you; I was in/out in maybe 5 minutes tops! I ordered two egg white breakfast sandwiches, two large orange juices, and a side order of pancakes. I ordered, walked off to go stand in a corner and my order was ready! I was blown away!\n\nStaff are quick, efficient, and on-point. Kudos to all these employees for working so hard and fast to cater to everyone down here!"
27436,3,"My printer won't connect to my laptop. It's really annoying. It means I can't print simple documents. What do I do when I need these simple documents? I was worried that requesting a printing job for 40 sheets in black and white would seem too small. Not for Pace Print. They happily printed off 20 sheets, one-sided, black and white and then another 20 sheets black-and-white double-sided, at the grand total of \u00a36. Sure it's more expensive than if I had my printer up and running, but I was in a pickle and they happily did this for me.\n\nKudos to the staff member who served me. He was really friendly and helpful.\n\nI simply had to email them a PDF of my document and they emailed me once it was printed and ready to collect (in around half an hour). I really couldn't fault the service at all."
6275,3,100% southern comfort food at a great price.  You can't beat it!
30016,0,My gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever. I left before finishing the 90 minutes. I probably feel better massaging myself. So very disappointed.
6146,0,This restaurant closed on 12/16/2012.
43619,1,"We started out really excited to go to this place, but left feeling sort of deflated about the customer service. \n\nThe decor looked great, background music was a nice indie blend and the place was clean.\n\nWhen I asked our waitress about the beer selection and that I primarily prefer belgian and wheat ales, she said she couldn't really help me because she only liked hoppy beers since she started working there. She didn't tell me about any of the guest ales on tap (there was an Orange Blossom) or to even help to explain about any of the house beers that would have a low IBU (International Bitterness Units). So I ordered the house root beer. Not bad.\n\nWe ordered a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good, but then we waited and waited for the waitress to come around and ask us if we wanted dessert (we did), but she brought us the check (on a slow night with about 12 people in the restaurant) and left before we could even ask her about the desserts. My husband had to go over to the dessert case to get the owner to order our dessert for us. And the tiramisu was really lacking.\n\nBottom line: For a brewery/restaurant that has been open for more than a few months, I expect better service and consistency than this. Get it together.\n\nParent Perspective: Two high chairs available (that I saw), two items for the kids' menu and no changing table in the bathroom."
48168,1,"I have been a HUGE fan of Cafe Rio and went to the Gilbert location many many times when I lived in the East Valley.  I would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there I enjoyed it so much.  \n\nOnce I heard they were opening a location on my new end of town I was thrilled to say the least.  It was going to be my new regular place to go for Mexican food each week.  \n\nWell......that is not exactly the way it turned out. \n\nI've been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so I write this review in confidence that I did not simply just catch them on a bad day.  \n\nEach time the line to get through was painfully slow.  The last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes (yes I timed it) for us to be served.  I'm not amused by their singing in the least.  That does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.  In fact, they seemed stressed,  grumpy, and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.  \n\nI'm willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.  Only 2 people working the front line?  Come on Cafe Rio. You guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.  They did not have a runner refilling the bins either; not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.  Hey management/ownership, you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.  \n\nOnce we navigated the line and survived the slow service, we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.  They only had a tiny bit left, and they put that on top.  We looked at them and said, is that all you have?  We were told they would bring some more out soon.  When we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge. So, they charged the $2.50 (or so) for it and said they would bring it out to us.  \n\nBy this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.  In this case, an extra $2.50.  then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.  $2.50 for that?  Hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.  I know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap, but come on, stop being so chincy, CR. \n\nI've just noticed the meat portions have become smaller, the prices have gone up, the service has gone south, and now we are no longer loyal customers."
21605,1,"I came here for the book club yesterday, and I can't say that I will be back  any time soon.  The afternoon started off well, but ended in a general distaste for this place.\n\nWhen I first got there, there was hardly anyone at the resturant, and it seemed like we got loads of attention from our server.  She was always coming over to us to bug us to order something.  I honestly wasn't that hungry, but I felt like I should order something, since the waitress kept coming over.   I ordered the American hot dog plate, and got fries and my coke to go with it.  \n\nEventually every one else ordered, but one girls sliders order completely got ignored and never delivered.  When she mentioned something to the server, she seemed as surprised as we were.  It seems like after I food got delivered, that's when things went downhill.  For starters, the place got packed with people watching the USA/Canada hockey game, but I feel like maybe we got forgotten.  So much so, that I had to ask a manager to get our bill for us.  I also told him that we haven't seen or heard from our server in almost an hour.  then, when the bill DID finally come, we had to send it back to get split so we could all play our share.\n\nI know its a sports bar, but it really lacked in service.  I think our table really felt ignored after while, with no drink refills, and having to flag down servers to even get our bill.  I don't plan on returning, as I was neither impressed with the food nor the service."
31903,3,"This is a beautiful lounge with an amazing view and excellent service.  The tea is quality and well presented.  There is also a nice cocktail selection.  I haven't tried the food.  \n\nIt is, however, a bit pricey.  I understand that it caters to a higher level clientele, but if the prices were a tad more reasonable, I'd return far more often (and award it with 5 stars)."
10116,0,"worst way to get around the strip,first the machine was out of order to buy tickets,additional machine on 2 floor,got there a security offer told us to back again.\nWhen  we finally got the monorail was not even easy to get out to the strip ,they make you go throw every casinosw"
31289,4,"Was here about 11:30 am on Fri/11 Oct:\n- Definitely recommend coming to this store.\n- The proprietors donate store gift certificates to charity (for charity raffles) and I had won 3 x $25 gift certificates at the Thu/3 Oct 2013 Round 4: Knockout Cancer For Candlelighters Kids event raffle.  \n- I was in the store to redeem the $75 in certificates and the staff/owners were very friendly.  Cindy congratulated me on winning the raffle and said I didn't have to spend the entire $75 credit at one time.  The certificates had no expiration date, either, so definitely customer friendly policies.\n- As I picked out what I wanted Cindy kept a running total to let me know when I was around the $75 mark.  I ended up getting $118.79 in stuff (including tax) - $75 certificates = I only paid $43.79.  Stuff I got included $30 skulls silver earrings, $7 Ed Hardy shot glasses, $9 skull & crossbones wallets.  Pretty sure my male/female friends in Thailand will love these gifts from Vegas/USA."
43903,3,"Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. \n\nThe crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good."
1800,4,"My girlfriend and I wanted a weekend getaway.  We found the Royal Palms Resort and gave it a try.  It was a little pricey, but it was well worth it for the atmosphere and experience.  We loved the Hacienda feel of the property and enjoyed the time at the pool.  No rowdy kids were to be seen and everyone was enjoying the sun and quiet.  The whole evening was quiet.\n\nThe room we stayed in was also amazing!  It consisted of a tile shower and shutters in front of the bath tub.  It was fun to get away for a weekend.  We even ate at TCooks restaurant.  The food was expensive but we enjoyed being pampered like royalty.  Oh and the drinks we just as great!\n\nI would go back to the Royal Palms anytime.  Definitely recommend it!"
45204,2,"First visit tried the 8oz bt bacon cheeseburger.  When asked what temp I wanted I thought I hit the jackpot.  It's so nice to order a burger the way I liked it, which in medium rare.  Unfortunately, if only the burger arrived at that temp.  Burger was more med well.  Very disappointing.  When I was ordering and watching the kid smash the burgers on the flat top I had a suspicion that the burger would arrive over cooked. Bacon was thick and tasty. Not overcooked.  Cheddar cheese was lacking in flavor.  Could barely taste it.    Usually I would send it back but I was hungry and didn't have time to waste.  Tater tots were crispy and cooked perfectly.  Nice and crispy and not over greasy.  Servers were around constantly to check on drink refills.  BT's is the only burger joint in the area so they will do well.  I'll go back and hopefully they can train their cooks a little better."
9851,3,"I stayed here last summer with my parents and nephew, and my expectations were very low. So, I was pleasantly surprised. If you have been to real castles in Europe, Excaliber actually does a great job. It is a castle, not a mansion. It's old school stone castle feel. It was clean enough and my nephew loved it. Our view of McCarran airport and the mountains was actually pretty spectacular at sunset. I've stayed in dumps and I've stayed in the lap of luxury. I think my review is quite fair. Coffee shop food was better than Dennys, good enough that we visited several times for convenience. Even had fun secret gambling with Pops in there.\nAnd we LOVED the slide at the pool. Pool was also better than expected."
7490,1,"Odd that they're a Greek place yet they have ravioli, texas toast, and other Italian items.\n\nThis place does have a locals only feel.  I felt that when I was waiting to place my order while the only server chatted about her granddaughter with a local woman at a nearby booth.\n\nInterior has a few Greek-themed pictures on the walls, but the booths date back to the 70's or so, and the chairs probably as well.  As other reviewers noted, this appears to be a sketchy part of town, so it can make one a bit uncomfortable.\n\nHummus was a bit gritty/lumpy, tasted a bit bland, and for some reason took a good 10 minutes or so to arrive even though the only other table in the restaurant already had their food.  Pita was dry, chewy, and tough.\n\nMaybe next time I'll go for the texas toast and ravioli instead."
5460,3,"The decor is classic dark brew pub. It works. A nice place to hang with your friends or just chill by yourself.\n\nAn above average pub menu. The breakfast menu is pretty good, with lots of choices. We like it - my sweetie loves to come here.\n\nToday we showed up a bit late for breakfast, so we fastened onto the lunch menu. Again,  lots of choices. I went with the \""round mountain\"" roast beef sandwich,  my sweetie went with the Paradise Carnita sandwich. We both had the home made chips,,, my sandwich was okay -- it was as advertised -- but it was kinda bland for my taste. Not Steiner 's fault,  the roast beef sandwich would be killer for someone with a blander palette than mine.  The Paradise Carnita sandwich was absolutely KILLER.\nSo full of flavor -- an awesome choice,  sweetie loved it as did I.  I know what Im ordering on my next visit.  Pulled pork ( carnita style )  with spicy sauce and pico de gallo served on a sweet sourdough roll. Amazing sandwich.\n\nGood selection of beers - on tap and in bottles. Service was good,  and the prices are fair. Recommended."
43652,1,"While in Old Montreal was looking for a place to have a quick crepe. I viewed the menu while outside the resturant, and it looked good. The staff is very  young and friendly, but not professional.  I saw customers leaving after sitting as no wait staff came to table to anknowledge them.\n\nI ordered a simple ham and cheese crepe, it took about 20 minutes to arrive. It was just ok. I ordered a dessert crepe which was dulce leche with banannas. Both the carmel sauce  and the bannanas were very skimpy.\n\nI got my bill which was $26 for the 2 crepes and a pepsi. Definetly not worth the price. I wouldnt recommend this place."
48320,2,"The food here is excellent. The service was friendly but grossly incompetent. My husband and I arrived and there was not a table available. After about 10 minutes several tables left and a table was cleaned and we were seated. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes with no menus. I went to the counter. There was a person standing there that did not acknowledge me until I asked for menus.  I took the menus back to my table and we sat there for another 10 minutes waiting to place  our order. At this point I was confused as to how I was supposed to order. I went to the counter again to ask if I was supposed to order there. A server came over to take our order. After our order was placed, I noticed that 2 tables that had come in after us were already eating. Our food arrived and was very good. The owner came out during our meal and checked to see if we were enjoying our food. The server never returned for drink  refills.  We finished eating our meals and sat there for a long time waiting for our plates to be cleared and for our check. The restaurant had slowed down considerably from the time of our arrival. There were two servers standing around chatting and one playing on her cellphone. I went to the counter again and asked for the check. The girl playing with her cellphone says she can close out my check and then proceeds to ask me for each item that has been ordered.  It is a shame that we were not given even basic service. The food really was good, but we will not be returning."
4837,0,"Do not order service from this store.\nAbysmal customer service from the install sales team.\n\nThey installed a 2 brand new HVAC units on the roof of our duplex.\nThey had to cut into our (NON LEAKING) roof to install it.\nIt leaked.\n\nIt's Las Vegas - you don't find these things out until a really heavy monsoon. We found out less than a year after install. It leaked in both places where they cut the holes for the return ducts. We reported it and the installer came out and supposedly fixed the leaks.\n\nAnother year goes by before another truly heavy monsoon. And the roof is still leaking in the same place on one of the units!!! We call again. This time, it takes over a week to get a customer service person out to look at it. \n\nLowes says the labor is not warranteed after the first year. AND most importantly - THEY HAVE LOST THE RECORD of our reporting THE LEAK the first time around WITHIN the year warrantee period. To top this off - the company Lowes contracted with, Phoenix Air, has gone out of business!\n\nLowes, you really really suck."
21153,2,"Finally, someone got smart and decided to open a Metro Pizza in Henderson! I no longer have to fight UNLV students on their lunch break for a nice booth and some pizza. The new location I believe is better than the original. It has a full bar area, a party room, and regular dining room. There is also a separate wing for pick up orders so you don't have to trek all the way through the restaurant in your pj's and slippers. The pizza is great on its own, but the nuclear fries are so good, I would go just for those. They are spiced and have a bit of a kick, and make the perfect addition for a pie. They also have a variety of beers on tap, which also obviously pairs well with pizza. Avoid the weekend evenings though because the hype around the new restaurant is still prevalent. It's packed. Lunch is the best time, and things stay pretty quiet. \n\nRecommended pizza: The margherita.\n\nRecommended beer: Hefeweizen with some lemons."
5587,3,"This is my second review of this place and I really wish I could give Sultan's Grill 5 stars!\n\nThe only thing is the fact that at least 4 separate nights when I came to their restaurant and they were OUT OF LAMB and then today during lunch they were OUT OF SPINACH PIES!\n\nI came around 1pm today so luckily, they didn't run out of  the stuff to make Gyros, Fries and Cucumber Sauce.  I am a fan of those.  I could eat their gyros all day and night.\n\nQuick Tip: They have spinach pies on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only.  I wish I could have the chance to try it out, though.\n\nAlso, it appears they are open Sundays per the signa posted today."
5633,4,Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.
44317,4,Amazing food from beginning to end. Don't miss the quinoa stuffed avocado. The Classic Saltado is scrumptious! Great kids menu too :)
37096,4,"I always get excited over crepes for some reason. However, I don't think I like crepes. Maybe, I just like the idea and/or look of them.\n\nVery clean, fairly good-sized venue. Service is an A. Their coffee crunch (forgot the exact name of it) ice cream is good. A good variety of fresh toppings. One of the guys, who seems to be slightly older than other workers I've seen there before, makes the crepes very well. The others make them just fine as well.\n\nThey offer other items such as waffles, juices, and food I believe."
47604,1,"Love them in the food truck...pub, not so much. Went two times. My kid and husband both RAVE about the mac and cheese, but since I'm not a cheese fan, I haven't had it. I've only eaten the pizza and I have not been impressed.\n\nLast time, I ordered the vegan Mexican pizza. It was so bland and tasteless that I asked for hot sauce to douse it in. The server said they had none...so it went back to the kitchen because I'm not a fan of eating cardboard. He still charged us for it. I paid $10 for a bite of a terrible pizza. I won't be back!\n\nAlso, fyi, if you sit in the main bar area near a speaker, prepare to lose some of your hearing. They blast the music."
24620,4,"My husband and I stayed here back when it first open in 2008, so everything was new! I've had this in my bookmarks for years and I never got around to writing a review until now. I will tell you that the experience here is wonderful! The customer service is terrific and the rooms are out of this world! Aside it being far from the other happening places on the strip, you can take the tram to the main parts of Vegas. \n\nI've been going to Vegas every year since 2006 and I can tell you that this place is one of the best hotels to stay at. If you're looking for more of an Old Vegas experience, try the older hotels, but I think old and young people alike can attest that this hotel is immaculate!"
18016,4,"Hands down the most phenomenal food experience thusfar in my life. I have dined at numerous fine dining establishments around the world, but this takes the prize. Wow. Every bite that went into my mouth was exquisite. I would drive all the way from LA just to eat at Binkley's. \n\nSo unassuming from the outside, but what a pleasant suprise inside. The staff is extremely friendly and all well-versed in the menu and ingredients in each dish. I highly recommend doing the 4-, 5- or 6-course meal. It's not going to be a budget evening, but honestly, well-worth every penny. I am salivating just thinking about it! In addition to your course (highly recommend the steak tartare, scallops, duck, - but the menu changes frequently), you are presented with at least eight amuse bouchers (\""treats from the chef\"") throughout the course of your meal. Oh. My. Gosh. It's amazing how in one bite you taste so many delicious flavorfuls meld together in your mouth and create this to-die-for taste! A few examples... blue cheese froth with homemade beef jerky rested on an endive leaf, potato soup with white truffle flakes and chives, homemade Italian salami with dates on a homemade sweet potato chip, deviled quail egg, etc. I can't even begin to describe the tastes... \n\nI highly HIGLY recommend Binkley's for an amazing food experience. Don't forget to try their homemade potato chips and bread! Enjoy!"
28927,1,"Wonderful ambience, though a mediocre haircut. Definitely not worth the price ($32) for a haircut. They did a similar job to \""best cuts\"" type place. Lady mostly used the trimmers, which were a turn off. Had an appointment yet still waited 30 minutes. Kind of let me down."
11877,3,"Absolutely delicious! \n\nWe went here for a pre-wedding dinner the night before. We love Thai and wanted to compare to our local favorite. \n\nI liked the Tom Kha Gai. The hint of lime was refreshing. \n\nWe also tried several others dishes. We asked for medium spicy but I felt like it wasn't that spicy. However, it was still best Thai food (aside from our usual local favorite) we've tried! We'll definitely come back!\n\nOne small note, come when your not rushed for time. Our waiter and food took a little bit longer than we're used to, but it wasn't a problem."
24055,4,"Ever since I moved from Hawaii I'm always on the lookout for something similar to Kuru Kuru from back home...therefore, I'm always looking for something deliciously cheap and with hugemangous portions --- YES, I SAID HUGEMANGOUS!\n\nMy friend, who's a sushi chef @ Marssa, kept telling me that Xtreme Sushi by my house was his favorite spot and I kept thinking he must be crazy cuz it's off strip and in a still developing area; AND I couldn't believe a place near my house was THAT good (let it be known that Southern Highlands is in dire need of foodie spots).\n\nI should've listened to him a long time ago...I'M AN IDIOT!\n\nALL-YOU-CAN-EAT lunch special is at 12-3 and it's UNDER $20!!! I think dinner is around $24, which is average. \n\nAnd it really is all you can eat! Like, EVERYTHING ON THE MENU!!!!!! E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. (except sashimi) But, there's appetizers, specialty rolls, curry, soba, ramen; I can go on & on & on...\nAnd trust me, I tried eating on & on &on... \n\nThe pieces of unagi were hugemangous..the same for the yellowtail =) And the sushi tasted so fresh. It's like they have the ocean in the backyard and they catch the stuff right before serving! Unbelievable. \n\nThe specialty rolls were ahhhhh-maaaa-zing! And you can order smaller portions with pieces of 4 so, you can SAMPS more rolls. My favorites were the Kayla and some unagi roll which was crisp on the inside and outside.\n\nAfter this lunch feast, I was done. SPOILED! I absolutely cannot eat at any other spot than this...EVEN SUSHIMON SUCKS in comparison. Believe it.\nNow, I tell all my friends, I don't want to eat at another sushi spot if I know I can get all-you-can-eat ridiculously hugemangously yummy sushi here!\n\nDo yourself a favor and SAMPS this place! And if you're eating lunch here, LET ME KNOW, I'll meet you. \nI am always looking for an excuse to eat up.... =)"
4819,1,"First time back in a long time...It's either gotten worse, or I've learned of better KBBQ in town....or both!\n\nWasn't a big fan of the meats truthfully...the only one that had flavor was the Marinated Pork Belly, and maybe the marinated chicken...the rest were a little boring and tough even after a quick sear.  Pic of the meats : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=zCo32peMlhCJI_0H7q1SUg#zCo32peMlhCJI_0H7q1SUg\n\nPic of the meats cookin' :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=YuJt74AHAnh24_SqZNedLg#YuJt74AHAnh24_SqZNedLg\n\nThe banchan was ok.  Nothing really stood out, but the servings were plentiful.  When we ran out of kimchi, they resupplied quickly after a request.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tofu-hut-las-vegas?select=vHznYxpqkzfUaFttHH7JUA#vHznYxpqkzfUaFttHH7JUA\n\nOnly half of the dining area has BBQ grills, so expect a wait.  Ours was about 30min, around 930pm on a weekday.  Not a big deal to me, just expect it.\n\nThe only thing they really have going for them are the prices.  It's about $14 for AYCE during 10pm+, so they are almost half price of most places.  But unless you can't afford the extra few dollars out on the town, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for KBBQ."

4508,1,"Oh Sweet Tomatoes how I USED to love you... Seems like this location has gone way down hill. Went for dinner with my hubby on a Thursday night at 445pm to try and beat the crowd. So many veggie bins on the salad line were empty or looked less than appetizing since someone would spill other stuff into another bin. Yuck. There were tons of kids running amuck thru the line as well putting their hands on everything. One kid had an entire plate full of just boiled egg crumbles and was running up and down the line with no parents in sight. Where are the parents or management/staff to control this kind of stuff? Putting hands on everything is so unsanitary, which is why I usually stray from buffets... When paying, I was shocked at the prices now. I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in about a year or so, but $28 for 2 dinners and 2 drinks at a salad bar seems way ridiculous. Another $10 or less and I could have gone to Outback and we could had some steak with our salad!\nAfter seating we went to get drinks and I was so disappointed that their tea was empty and they dont have apple juice anymore since I am not a big soda drinker. We then ventured to get some bread and soup to go with our salad. Almost all of the soups had that crusty layer on top from sitting so long. There was no butter for potatoes or bread. The foccacia and pizza bread was just the crusty outter layer that no one ever seems to take. The pastas were crusty and dry looking. So much for my appetite. After eating our salad and little bread/muffins that weren't old looking we went in for some of their gooey chocolate cake. Again only the outside rim of it was left and it was rock hard. The guy behind the counter said it would be a while before a new one was out. He just stared at the kid who was digging around the cake and using his finger to scrape the cake off the self serve spoon. Gross. We then just settled for a dry brownie muffin and ice cream. We never did take anything from the fruit/pudding bar since that was covered in kids as well and all the bins were almost empty. \nKnowing that I am pregnant and hormones are raging, I decided not to complain since it would probably turn out ugly with me either screaming or in tears. Just left hungry and disgusted. I will not be back to this location. Too bad the express location is closed now since I did frequent it all the time. Guess I will head back to the 215/Flamingo location with higher hopes. That one always seemed to hit the mark."

18548,2,"This was the first time I needed to wait at the service department while getting the oil changed. First off, it was not easy to make the appointment. I'll give them that I called on the Friday before the holiday weekend, but I kept getting rang back to the operator. Same Saturday, and apparently there was only one person there who can schedule appointments. So I waited until Tuesday, and got the same run around. I ended up making the appointment online, which in the end proved to be the fastest way because I actually got a call back within a couple of hours. Who knew? \n\nThe service department itself is a nice set up- like a mini town where you can pretty much have anything done to yourself while you wait short of plastic surgery. We're really only going here because we have the free services another year. But the mini town in the dealership could be just enough to keep me coming back even when I have to pay."
10184,1,"This place was a bit of a disappointment. Sure, it's a nice little restaurant in St. Mark's Square at the Venetian, the ambiance in nice, but the experience was not so good.\n\nService was slow and spotty. When we were seated, the waitress told us she was sending out water. Said water didn't arrive until we had received our meals and drinks, and only after we asked our waitress about it again. When we were offered parmesan on our food, the man who asked just walked away and vanished. We had to flag down or waitress to get it, who was noticeably absent throughout the evening. She then proceeded to absent-mindedly drop a huge chunk of cheese on the table, only to leave it there throughout the meal.\n\nFood was alright and came out very quickly, though it was almost too quickly, as if it had already been prepared before we ordered it. \n\nAfter the whole experience, I would probably not come back. There are many other restaurants nearby to choose from (it is Vegas, after all)."

9599,3,"Ah golden dragon I heart you. My grandmother is the one who showed us this little gem-apparently its very popular with the sun city (65+) crowd, but who can blame them? They have a killer ayce dinner special for $11.50pp but surprise... It's NOT buffet style. You order off a full menu and everything is made fresh to order! Make sure if you are doing the ayce to let the server know before you start ordering. \n\nYou start off with the appetizers and soup. They have the standard selection of apps; egg rolls, potstickers, pork spare ribs, fried shrimp etc. etc. Tonight we got bbq pork, cream cheese wontons (10) and I got a cup of hot n sour soup. The apps came out fairly quickly and everything was hot and crispy. So much better then when it's buffet style sitting out under heat lamps and getting soggy! Then after apps you can order entrees and rice or noodles. They have a good selection of chicken, beef and seafood entrees as well as different fried rices, noodles and egg foo yung.\n\nWe ordered honey walnut shrimp, shrimp pad thai and mongolian beef to start. The walnut shrimp is my favorite it's so sweet and delicious. Not calorie friendly at all but that's what makes it so good. The mongolian beef was tasty but lacked spice. Actually now that I think of it all their \""spicy\"" dishes are not spicy at all so I have to subtract 1 star! I like a little kick with my food especially when it is supposed to be spicy. Anyways we ordered another round of wontons and sweet n sour pork and I was so full after that my bf had to roll me out of there! \n\nA few things to note. If you order the ayce you MUST eat everything and they do frown upon leftover food. They have threatened to charge for any leftovers although it has yet to happen but just be aware. The portions are not huge but I do think they adjust the portion sized based on how many are in your party. I've gone with a party of 7 before and the entrees seemed to be bigger whereas they seemed to have less food when it was just me and the bf. And lastly they don't require reservations but they are recommended for large party. Also keep in mind this review is for the dinner special ONLY. You could of course order ala carte items and they also have take out but this is the best deal and we all know how much I love a good deal! my suggestion would be to go with a group so you can sample a little bit of everything. :)"
40970,4,"I never run back to work after lunch to Yelp about my great lunch experience. At least, I never have until now. I wasn't supposed to eat out today. I just wanted to get out of the office for a bit and finished reading Memoria de mis putas tristes. Somehow, I ended up in front of this place and the rest, as they say, is history... well, not really history, but you know...\n\nMany, many moons ago this pace was called Dynasty Buffet and it was a Chinese buffet. For what it was, if I remember correctly, it was pretty decent. It was kinds upscaley for a Chinese buffet.\n\nWhen I pulled in the front of the restaurant did not look particularly inviting. It's a big box building with big red letters and kanjis very similar to the way you see in Asian markets. Just kinda loud and... well, a bit tacky.\n\nI said, \""F it\"" and went in since it wasn't a buffet and I would get to read some while I waited for my food. The place is very spacious and minimally decorated. What little is there fits nicely with the atmosphere. The host and the waitresses were very pleasant and helpful.\n\nYou are given a menu, a pencil and a sheet of paper with a laundry list of dumpling options. I ended up settling for the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special (with your choice of egg drop. wonton or spicy egg drop soup) and sticky rice. To boot, I added a side order of chicken feet (HELL YEAH!) and some shark fin dumplings. The older Chinese waitress had to double check I knew I was ordering chicken feet before she wrote it down! haha.\n\nAfter I placed my order I grabbed by book and continued reading. Before I finished the page here comes a piping hot bowl of delicious egg drop soup. The soup was very good, better than average, and it came with a little pile of those flaky crackers and some chili paste. My Kung Pao chicken was delicious and very, very spicy! Unlike your average Chinese food strip mall hellhole, Dynasty understands its food and separates the rice from your main dish.\n\nShortly after came my chicken feet in a nice dark sauce topped with slices of jalape\u00f1os. They were delicious but very hard to eat and messy! They were perfectly cook and the bones were tender enough to chew threw if you chose to, like Becky, I chose to juts suck the marrow and the skin off.\n\nThe shark fin dumplings, which I've never had before, were delicious. Hot and had a very nice crab meets lobster and fish taste to them (can't really describe it) and were very nicely sized. Needless to say, I didn't finish it all.\n\nInterestingly, both the host and the waitress were genuinely interested in hearing my opinion of the chicken feet and the dumplings. They came around and chatted with me about the food and my thoughts which was awesome.\n\nIn front of me sat an older Chinese couple. At one point the woman got up and walked by my table, I noticed she did a double-take on my table but kept on going.  On her way back she stopped by the table and told me that I knew how to eat Chinese food like Chinese people do! hahahaha. We had a nice chat about how they really like this place because it's one of the few places where they can get real Chinese food they way they eat it back home.\n\nI will definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone who is an adventurous eater or likes really good Chinese food."
43160,4,"Best kept secret around - Thursday nite - bar food - City Tavern SouthPark - 1/2 priced appetizers - also $10 petite filet - it was melt in your mouth delicious.  Very surprised with that price you also get yummy mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  Service was impeccable and ambiance was great - bartender even changed music to jazz to accommodate the \""older folks\"" at the bar.  Same menu as Stonecrest location I think.  Interior is very classy - would imagine after the sun goes down it would be a very romantic place for dinner.  Will definitely make this a go-to place for the great service and delicious food."
14682,0,"Ok i have to be honest I am shocked that this level of quality is served at a steve wynn resort. The meal was comped but seriously this place was horrible. Panda express would be an improvement over this place. The bill was 130 for one person for lunch. Of course i had leftovers to take to pops but I felt like he might feel as though I was trying to poison him. I ordered the cantonese pot stickers to start. You could do better in the frozen section at costco. Next up I opted for the upgraded beef dish which is served table side on a sizzling platter it was like pepper beef sirloin or something like that. Really boring dish no imagination. was funny when i was ordering the waiter suggests i upgrade even further to kobe beef,I said well you probably wont get the benefit if its covered in a sauce,he says I will,even though i had a 200 comp and would not have had to pay for it I didn't do it. I asked him how much would it cost ,he says let me look on the menu,after we look together he cant find it he estimates it to cost around 90 dollars,like i said it would have been comped but it seemed too egregious to me. Next I ordered the sweet and sour chicken,total crap again you could do much better at panda express or costco. And lastly I ordered a bbq pork and shrimp combo fried rice,this was the best dish of all and I suspect that it is served regularly at the CCDC on fried crap night. In conclusion im glad i had  the comp but i still had to tip for 20 bucks ,its not the servers fault so i always take care of them. The server was very nice actually. Steve must be losing his taste as well as his vision because anyone who would rate this anything but touristy garbage food is on the payroll."

Now that I am a local in Las Vegas, I find that this taxi company is not \""elite\"" at all. I would honestly suggest avoiding using YCS Transportation whether you are a local in Las Vegas or a visitor. The reason: You can wait forever a never get a cab after you call. The people who take the calls sound exasperated and helpless."
9146,2,"We stayed there for 3 days and the place was okay. \nThe room was very clean and quite large with a nice view of the desert.  Indeed everywhere was very clean. The pool was a good size, heated too with a Jacuzzi.\n\nWhat lets it down was service. If this was in a big town they'd struggle.\n\nThe restaurant service was terrible for the Thursday morning breakfast we had , its called the Lariat. I reviewed that separately.\n\nThey offer a free shuttle to town which you will need to get there as its 1-2 miles away unless you want a cab. We tried 3 shuttles which  are advertised as being every hour on the hour. Each time there was no driver when we got to the shuttle and we had to hassle the front desk for a person to come. Eventually 5-10 minutes later a person would drive us to town.\n If you advertise that you run it hourly you have to have someone there.  Its hard to plan a night in town if you cant be sure when you'll get there.  You call for a pick up back to the resort and that worked far better.\n\nThe first day we had the do not disturb sign on until 10.30am and again from  12.45-2.15pm.  We received no maid service  at all or a call from the front desk saying that we wouldn't.  Not the end of the world but not good service either.\n\nThe resort itself is lacking in activities. I hear resort and think lots to do but there was no more to do here than a Holiday Inn. It just had a nicer pool and optional tennis.  Massages are a 100 dollars, not exactly a deal.\n\nThey've the makings of a good place here but could do so much better.  \n\nThe WiFi was excellent."
49880,0,"I will start with the good, recliners alcohol & good hot food (burgers....)\n\nOther than this being a knockoff attempt at the Galaxy theaters, that is where the good ends. I am surprised at the 5 star ratings here as the consumer is truly getting screwed here. Why? Regal in its infinite wisdom to ensure Red Rock Regal maintains its sweet profit margin is restricting the movies shown at the \""nice\"" luxury theater. Yes, mostly the shows will be Geri-rated. Snore! So if you want to view a blockbuster and also would like to sit it nice reclining seats go to a Galaxy theater where they are trying to screw you over.\n\nBut the theater is nice."

39151,3,"I was looking for a place to grab a quick bite to eat before heading over to watch a movie and this place caught my eye. As a bonus, at that time there was a 10% off coupon by checking in through yelp so I thought why not!\n\nMy boyfriend and friend ordered the roast beef sandwich which also came with a large side of fries. They both said the sandwich was pretty good, with nice and juicy roast beef. Sadly I didn't get to try any of their sandwiches. I ordered the Steak Bomb and it was definitely good. To me, it was basically a Philly cheesesteak and what's not to love about it? Meat, cheese, peppers, and mushrooms. Sounds good to me! Not only that, it was HUGE. I had a really hard time finishing it and I would say I can eat quite a bit.\n\nOverall, you get a lot of food for the money, and it's good food. I want to come back to try their roast beef sandwich next time."

The Angel chicken wings are one of the most pointless and hardest to eat foods that I have ever come across.  It is a chicken wing stuffed with pork and veggies and it was greasy and bland.\nThose were the only things I tried, they may have good dishes there, but after trying two and being dissappointed by both of them, I will not return."

Somewhere in between an American bar and a French bistro.\n* Outstanding food, which needs no further discussion here. For this Californian, though, foie gras (illegal back home, gah) was a standout with crispy seared surface.\n* Surprisingly reasonably priced, considering Las Vegas. 4-course + amuse menu was $78; before 6:30pm there's also the quick pre-theatre menu for $48.\n* Got half-bottles of Champagne & Chateauneuf du Pape for $88, which turned out better than ordering by the (relatively pricey) glasses. The fellow next to me ordered a whole Sancerre bottle for $40, well done.\n\nWhich reminds me about this fellow seated next to me -- French-speaking Jason Statham assassin-looking guy also eating solo. I was about to happily drown in the French bistro atmospheric cool, until he turned out to be from Ottawa, hockey talk and all, and that rather killed the romanticism."
15875,2,I've dined here a few times and it's always been pretty decent. My friends and I came in the early afternoon and didn't wait too long before we were seated. We got a great table next to the conservatory so we had a good view while we were dining. (We could hear the music from the conservatory which was a little troubling since the western music they were playing did not fit the whole springtime theme of the displays...but that's a whole other story.)\n\nThe food is mediocre and is fairly filling. My friends ordered the burger while I had the torts de milanesa which I had trouble finishing. It was a little hard to flag down our server when we needed refills for our soft drinks or anything else.

They finally called me and when I stood up, the hostess refused to seat me b/c my friend wasn't there yet!!\n\nI told her she was on her way and that I was going to order & eat immediately. She didn't care. I asked her if she would be giving me a different size table if I was by myself and she admitted she wouldn't. Again I asked her what the problem was and demanded to be seated. She just kept saying over and over again that it was their policy and that she would not seat me until my friend arrived in another 15 min. \n\nI was furious! She knew I walked in by myself and sat there right in front of the door by myself reading a book--so why didn't she say something before I wasted all that time?\n\nAdditionally, my friends went there about a week prior. After they finished eating they continued to study together for an exam. The place was dead, so it's not like they were taking up tables. The manager actually came over and told them they had to leave b/c they weren't buying anything!!\n\nI will never ever go back there.

26066,2,"I've stayed at the Hyatt a few times in the past (always booked on Hotwire.com for a lot less than the normal rate). The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside (typical 60's stark & practical concrete look of Montreal's downtown) but the rooms are very nice. The bathrooms are stocked with fluffy towels and nice bath products and the bed is really comfortable.\n\nIf it was just for the room and the service at the front desk, this place would get a 4 or 4.5 star rating. But there were a few things that bothered me.\n\n1. Not sure who the genius was that decided to go with fabric curtains on the inside of the shower instead of plastic, but newsflash idiot, that cotton/silk blend ABSORBS water. What does that mean? It means that every time I take a shower, there's a giant puddle of water on the bathroom floor. Good thing there were plenty of extra towels every day to mop up the mess.\n\n2. The hotel is located in the Complex Desjardins and is above a mall so the lobby is actually located on the 6th floor. This means that from the street or garage, you have to take two sets of elevators to get to your room. Not so bad, but when the hotel is busy, you can wait a while for an elevator.\n\n3. I am constantly travelling for work or pleasure, which means lots of nights spent in hotels. One thing I've learned in my travels is that the higher the star rating, the nicer the bed/bedding and towels are but the more expensive WiFi costs. I've stayed at cheap rundown hotels that smelled like urine (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/days-inn-conference-center-york#hrid:pjiJL4H3qJIYBzwtcNrNOw) that had free WiFi. But the 4 star Hyatt Montreal charges $14/day for WiFi access. Really Hyatt? With the high cost for a room (standard room rate), you'd think you could include free WiFi.\n\nIt's not all bad though. The hotel is located right on Ste Catherine next to the newly renovated festival district. It's right at Place des Arts and a few minutes walk to the old Port or the debauchery that is Ste Catherine street.\n\nIn conclusion, use Hotwire.com to book a room in Montreal. You'll likely get the Hyatt for $85/night, which is worth it. \n\nFinaly note directed at hotels in general: Why do you supply fancy moisturizing cremes, which no one uses, but no toothpaste?"
36043,1,"Not my usual pub & seafood spot but it was the birthday girls choice. Not to Shabby but nothing really stood out.\n\nCHEAP DRINKS: 3/5 Probably the only good thing about this place is the $2.95 tall draft beers $2.50 regular draft beers and $3.95 sangria's. Their selection of draft & bottled beers are pretty small. I assumed they would have a lot more but they don't. Sangria's pretty good, our waiter even said it was their \""famous sangria\"" but I've tasted better. It was super sweet and not enough fruit. The only thing in it was lemons and a cherry.\n\nFOOD: 1/5 Super oily, I ordered a Chicken Cajun Pasta and I felt like it was drenched in oil or butter. There was no sauce and my chicken was over cooked so instead of getting a blackened smoked slices of chicken breast they gave me burnt chicken. I did like the mushrooms in this dish that was pretty much the only good thing.\n\nSERVICE: 2/5 Our waiter okay.... he was knowledgeable but not really attentive. Had to wave my hands in the air a couple times to flag him down. Right before we ordered he wasn't bad. Kept on coming back asking us if we were ready, but once we ordered he was no where to found."
37720,2,"I got the BBQ burger and it was good for the price. Nothing special. I wouldn't wait in a long line for it though. Love the crispy skinny fries but the ranch sucked. Lots of shakes to choose from.\n\nThis is also not a place to just sit, hang out & talk . When you see the line you kinda feel obligated to leave."
32132,4,"One of my all-time favorite restaurants, definite proof that value doesn't have to mean compromise. \n\nPerfect for lunch, dinner, to-go, catering, I've done it all here. \n\nI have pretty Americanized taste buds, but still I spring for the traditional menu often, it's adventurous without being intimidating, and it's less than seven bucks after tax for a properly filling meal. The soups in particular just warm you up inside. \n\nPad thai here is also exceptional and come with plenty of meat.\n\nI ordered catering here for a large party and it was incredibly competitive pricing plus they delivered the order such a convenience.\n\nGreat place to bring people great date place too the decor is very nice and there is a great drink/happy hour menu. While not alcoholic, I do recommend their thai ice tea if you like sweeter beverages. \n\nReally cannot speak more highly about this place, but there is a small warning if you are not a fan of spicy foods make sure you order yours MILD. Even some dishes when ordered mild will have a kick and medium to hot dishes can have quite the lingering burn, but I could just be a wuss. Order the sweet ice tea in case and the spice won't be a problem you can't handle."
49138,2,"Great casual Japanese option on the strip. Only Con its a little on the pricey side for casual Japanese food. It has a large open dining area with floor to ceiling windows that face the strip. Great for people watching! The menu has a wide range to choose from sushi, ramen, etc. My favorite menus items were crispy cod & pork shoulder steam buns. For dessert my 2 favorites were the doughnuts (tofu,sweet potato,rosemary) and soft serve (coffee, pop rocks, nori, carmel). Definitely order together for a great pairing!"
29874,4,"Fabulous.  Fantastic.  A group of six. 4 of the six had the trio of Elk, Beef, Bison and loved it.  I had the flat iron special.  Fantastic.  Only complaint - the beet salad was very LIGHT on beets - but they were fantastic.  I could have done without the cabbage piece of it - very nondescript - but the beets were fantastic.  Also, we were celebrating a birthday and brought a bottle of wine as a gift - not to share at the meal, but as a gift.  We weren't allowed to bring it in - I'm hoping it was liquor laws that forbade it.  If we had it in a bag or wrapped - it wouldn't have been a problem.  interesting.  But overall - a great meal!  Highly recommended."
35500,2,"I like that you don't have to go through the casino to get here because they have 2 entrances.. Yard House is on my list of places I frequent for only Happy Hour but not their regular menu.. haha their regular dinner menu is a bit over priced for a bar with average food but it doesn't matter because I only come for HH~!!! I've been here on several occasions for Happy Hour, late night Happy Hour, on the cusp of Happy Hour lol \n\nThings that I enjoy:\n-Chicken Lettuce Wraps- or you can get them with mushrooms instead of chicken mmm\n-Hawaiian Poke Stack- watch out sometimes the tuna is not that fresh though lol\n-Spinach Cheese Dip- so bad for you but so good\n-Chicken Nachos- quantity over quality.. huge portion; great for sharing\n-Pizzas- pretty tasty \n-Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat - tastes like Fruity Pebbles\n-Light Lemon Drop Martini- low cal; tasty; strong\n-Spinach & mushroom salad appetizer portion (not on HH) but it's delicious and cheap!\n\nService has always been friendly and fast. One time my boyfriend and I barely made it for the last seating and the server wasn't rude and didn't rush us! Even though this Yard House is located inside Red Rock Casino it is not owned by them so they don't accept any of the mailer coupons from the hotel~ \n\n\n\nHOT TIP: Happy Hour:  Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm \n                                      Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close\n                                      Last Seating: 30 minutes prior to close"
12784,0,This place is horrible. They lie to you and tell you that u win gifts or a trip and that u dont come out of pocket. I asked if it was a time share and they told me no. When I got there it was timeshare. And the gifts that they tey to give u that u dont come out of pocket u do pay for. They are liars and tricked us into  what turned out to be nothing they talked about!

17757,1,"I was craving korean bbq one night and decided I'd eat somewhere I've never been before, so I ended up at this place. I ordered a combo that came with some spicy tofu soup and a few pieces of short ribs for $18. The tofu soup honestly tasted like mildly spicy water, there was hardly any flavor. The short ribs were somewhat good. The whole time while I was eating, nobody came to my assistance asking if I needed anything else. Minutes later a young lady came and asked me to pay even when I wasn't even done with my food (I found this kind of rude). I told her I wanted to order something else because I was still kind of hungry, so I went and ordered some beef cubes which came out to be $28 (Pretty pricey for a plate with a few pieces of meat). She still insisted me on paying for my first meal and then pay for the other stuff later. The beef came out to be a little over cooked, there was no juiciness to it. The whole entire time, still, no one came to ask me if everything was okay. I wasn't too satisfied with the customer service. All in all, I could've gotten all you can eat korean bbq over at Korean Garden, Tofu Hut, or Sura for way less with better service. Don't think I'll be coming back."
20053,2,"The service is excellent and the wait time wasn't too bad. Only about 10-15 minutes to get a table, which is reasonable for a weekend spot. The restaurant is clean and definitely a popular spot for breakfast since every table was filled. The food unfortunately didn't \""wow\"" me. I ordered the Three Pigs omelette, which was covered with a massive amount of jack cheese. So much that the grease from the cheese puddled into one corner of the omelette.  I had to scrape most of the cheese off. I could barely taste the meat flavors and was hoping for a crunchy bacon filling with the sausage and ham. The side potatoes were a bit overcooked and over seasoned and the English muffin was drenched in butter. Maybe my stomach wasn't in the mood for lots of oily fats, because I just wasn't impressed by the meal or flavors.\n\nI would definitely return again and try another dish. It's difficult to find a great breakfast spot, so I won't rule this place out. I unfortunately can't give it a four or five star rating like most of the reviews on here because it just wasn't that spectacular."
34209,3,"I love this place! Caked really saved my butt, they took my Birthday cake order for a Sunday (a day on which they are closed, which I didn't know!) My cake was ready on Saturday and I was able to bring it to the Restaurant for my birthday dinner the next day.\n\nI ordered a Lemon poppy seed cake with fresh strawberries and whipped cream for the filling the cake was fresh, tasty and beautiful ( (I will include a photo!) Caked was recommended to me by Retro bakery as they were booked for the day but I will always recommend Caked!  They also gave us some coffee cookies to taste which were delicious!!"
21178,4,"So I was fortunate enough to have an friend take me here for dinner my first week  in town.  This place is legit!  \n\nThe menu changes constantly and is based on what is fresh and at its best.  For the reason, we decided to go with the tasting menu and paired wines.  Now this option wasn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but MY GOODNESS was it worth it.  Since they offered a vegetarian options, we ordered that as well as the omnivorous version.  It was great because we were able to taste the best of both worlds. There were at least 5 courses and wow. They were all stand outs. By the time we got to dessert, we were almost stuffed! That's great because often times tasting menus can be downright paltry.  \n\nOh and the wines.  I'm swooning just thinking about the wines that they chose per course.  Some American, but also Italian, Spanish and French. Again, totally worth what we paid for it.  \n\nNow service was a bit spotty. Our waitress was AMAZING and the hostesses were completely sweet. But some of the food runners were more on point than others. We asked one of them about what was on our plates, since she hadn't announced it when she brought it to the table. Unfortunately, she had no clue.  So we learned not to ask her any questions and kept it moving.   A very minor slight though.\n\nIn short: if you want to take a date somewhere that you can pretty much guarantee a happy ending to the night, Legume is your choice.   Parents coming to town and want to pay for dinner? Legume all day.  I really hope to go back again sometime soon."
47842,0,"If I can give a 0 star I will !!!!!! I order a Tostada of ceviche there for 6,45 dollar a combo an they only gave me this !!!!! Never go back here !!!! Never order a tostada of ceviche !!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
10401,2,Not bad - great location - $1 margaritas (small but yummy); outback steakhouse & denny's is connected to the hotel.  It's a decent place to stay if you just need a place to crash for the night.
37959,2,"I didn't really have a good experience at Marquee but that has a little to do with the fact that I was completely sober and the company I was with as well. \n\nWe were on the guestlist for Marquee so my friend and I rushed to get ready to go to the Cosmopolitan where Marquee is located. Because of this, we didn't have any time to pregame at all. But honestly, with such long lines, even if we did have time, the buzz would have worn off long before we get in. \n\nSo, even though I was told being on the guest list, you skip the line and cover before 11, the guest list line was crazy long. We lucked out because when I went to ask the bouncer how long the wait would be and what not, the party in front of us apparently didn't have an even boy-girl ratio so they asked if we wanted to join them to go in and go our separate ways from there. So we did that. They were hotel guests so their line was a lot shorter than ours but we still had to wait a good hour before getting in and they were each only able to bring in one girl (one of the guys in their party digged out) so I let my friend go in for free and I just paid the $20. \n\nOnce inside, it was super packed so my friend got really annoyed and wanted to leave after 10 minutes. I really want to try visiting Marquee again someday with other friends (a bigger group next time since everyone decided against joining us). \n\nIt's pretty cool though if you don't mind crowds and lines and if you're in the mood for clubbing.  There's 3 floors but the top floor is a little boring. One floor is for house and trance music while the other one plays hip hop. The floor with the house music is where the party's at though."
37334,0,"After just about an hour of waiting for our 3 orders of various nachos we walked out...I think the wait was absolutly ridiculous and the waitress and manager agreed with me as well. \nWe were excited about trying our nachos as there were numerous options to put on the \""build your own nachos\"" page...All chips said they were made on site and my daughter who is so picky loved the idea of spam being on her nachos..Yes, my fellow islanders-SPAM is an option as well as kim chee-exciting huh? If we only we had 4hrs to kill then maybe we could have tried it!!! We waited and waited and waited and finally nothing!!!! The waitress kept telling us that it will be just a few minutes but after a while we knew tasting our nacho masterpieces was not meant to be...\nWhile waiting we were given house muffins(jalapenos inside) with honey butter- the muffins were so cold and sadly we did not enjoy these. As we stood up to leave the waitress let us know that there are 3 cooks in the kitchen and 3 managers all assisting the cooks trying to get food out-seems like mass confusion to me as it was not a packed restaurant at all!!! I know this is a new place (the waitress said they have been open for a month) but why open a restaurant if your cooks aren't able to handle 3 orders of nachos- nachos a dish that is in your name and supposedly your speacialty....Kinks should have been worked out within the first few weeks because the last thing you want especially now is for your customers to walk out because of the wait and not be able to even try the food.\nThe waitress was nice and seemed embarrased by the wait herself and it was also said that a table before us also walked out because of the wait. She got the manager who was also apologetic and said that there was no excuse for the wait. So to compensate for our time there he gave us a $15.00 gift certificate to come back.Hmmm I'll have to sleep on that..."
7314,4,"We discovered this place by accident and have used it for the last 2 years.  Feri is the new owner having bought it from Nati.  Feri is a very quiet soft spoken lady,  great seamstress, not very entrepeneurial (good for clients) and a push over if you are going to haggle (please don't) we also want her to stay in business and keep her kind demeanor.  Over the last two years, we have had her hem countless pairs of slacks and for $10-12 ea, had her sew custom furniture covers  and shade cloth for outdoor area.   For any sort of custom work,  we think the pricing is very fair. The regular work like hemming is a low as it should go.  For the customer who was complaining about the price alteration on their $50 pair of pants for semi custom work, what are you expecting?  You do semi custom work on designer clothes/suits or gowns or you have a sentimental attachment to a piece of clothing else its not worth it."

19861,0,"This school is an abysmal daycare masquerading as a qualified preschool. I had my daughter at Top of the Classs for about a month and a half before pulling her out due to rude staff and the poor quality education she was receiving. I am absolutely shocked that this place is in business. I can concur with another Yelper about the front doors constantly being left open which is extremely concerning. On top of the lack of security, I'm not sure any of the teachers have any formal education or teaching credentials. Miss Melanie the supervisor/manager is extremely brusk and rude. If she was working the front desk she would NEVER greet my daughter or me at drop offs or pickups. She would make eye contact and look back down at her phone or paperwork. The center is outdated and I witnessed large groups of children eating snacks and lunches on the floor in the hallway. There were older children (8-10 year old's) running around the younger pre-k children completely unsupervised. My daughter learned some EXTREMELY inappropriate things and constantly complained about older kids picking  on her and calling her names. My daughter is well adjusted and has never had issues. I made a huge mistake by ever introducing this school into her life. \n\nThere are some wonderful primary schools and preschools in the Valley. Unfortunately, Top of the Class isn't one of them. Parents BEWARE!"
47423,3,"Friendly, helpful staff. They were 1 of the 10 pubs on a pubcrawl from World's End Pub on the Royal Mile, and coming all the way out to Leith seemed a bit much so I could get a stamp that would lead to a T-shirt. Nonetheless, The Waterline is a cozy, warm place, combining a modern feel with an ancient building with lots of light in the front and brown wood interior in the back. Also love the Biergarten, a la Germany. Ale selection was less than I'd hoped for, though they did have good Scottish ale."
31398,3,"I joined some friends for a birthday dinner at Modern Steak. The restaurant a great ambiance - fun decor, swanky feel without feeling pretentious. The service was excellent... I definitely felt like a VIP for a night. \n\nWe started off at the bar and ordered a \""Retail Therapy\"" Martini: Belvedere Vodka, Grand Marnier, Strawberry, Basil & Lemon Juice. A good choice - it wasn't overly sweet and the basil added a nice touch. \n\nAppetizers consisted of Warm Asparagus Pizza, Crispy Prosciutto, Organic Fried Egg - Delicious! (I'm a big fan of the newly embraced French style of topping dishes with an egg) and Margherita Pizza, San Marzano Tomatoes, Fresh Basil - also very tasty. \n\nI was on a budget, so I sadly only ordered a salad, but a very good salad it was! I got the Roasted Beet Salad with pistachio, watercress and boucheron cheese. A nice, light summer salad that filled me up. \n\nI did try the filet that came with some carmelized onions - YUM! It was so good! People at the table were also raving about the Chilean Sea Bass. \n\nI definitely would like to go back and get a filet. It's pricey, but it's always fun to splurge on great steak sometimes."
28293,1,"Maybe I just don't get it. It's a tall, bright, clean store. It's a fancy store. But it's not at all what I expected of a Harvey Nichols. Even though I was just in for a wander (as the store carries very little in the way of things in my budget or size), I was underwhelmed."
17248,2,"Four stars, but I knocked one off because the pasties are pre-made and you can't ask for substitutions. \n\nI've been here twice. I will definitely go back, and I've recommended this spot to friends, but I was pretty bummed to find out last time that I can't ask for more of this or none of that. \n\nSeating is VERY limited. Unless you're going to be there the minute they open, I would call ahead for take-out. If you're dead set on satisfying a craving, you'll want to call ahead to make sure they're not out of whatever you want, too. We found that out the hard way. \n\nAll in all, it's a tasty spot. Best for take-out."
45147,2,"This is your average Chinese restaurant. Cheap but average food. They have a really cheap lunch menu, for only $5.95 you get an entree and a drink.\nTheir customer service is very good. They checked on us on a regular basis and refilled our drinks in a timely matter. \nThe food is just ok, but again you get what you pay for.\nI found it kind of strange that they do not believe in plates.  The food is delivered on styrofoam and no serving spoon, which makes the food look even less appealing. \nOverall, the restaurant is just ok if you are looking for a cheap and quick meal."
25281,2,"This is your perfect place to bring someone after going out.\nInstead of going to macdonald or some fast food joint this place is cheaper,healthier and quicker than any fast food store.\nPlus you can grab something for breakfast the next day.\nNo matter what time i go i always see people baking fresh bagel.\nI'm more of a conservative guy so i usually take sesame bagel or butter bagel.\nHope this help,\n\nCheers,\n\nEric Van Nguyen"
46329,3,"My mother in law was in for a visit and we were in the mood for soup and salad. I had been wanting to try Caf\u00e9 Zupas and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. As we walked in, the young lady at the front door explained the menu and offerings - this was very helpful seeing it was our first visit. It was busy, but the staff at the counter took the time to explain things and let us taste a few of the soups, which was very helpful. \n\nI had the chicken enchilada chili and the BBQ chicken salad. Both were great. My mother in law loved her food as well. The meal also came with a chocolate covered strawberry. It actually was a lot of food.  The only bland part of the meal was the bread that came with the soup - it was nothing special. \n\nThe dining room was very nice and the attendant in the room was a really sweet, helpful lady.\n\nI'll definitely plan on returning in the future."
13304,2,Me and my Business partner had dinner there last night. Ordered the Chief special with Kobe Ribeye and My partner ordered the Filet. Both were good. Nothing to rave over thou. I would expect better quality for the price and would probably choose a different steak house next time.
17257,4,Amazing place.
25552,2,"Just feel the need to keep it real and updated. I had my first not-great experience here the other day. I tried on a couple jeans that I didn't love - I'm over the super stretch, no pockets in the front, tiny pockets on the ass, guaranteed to fall apart lady jeans. Was I ever under these? regardless. I asked the gent who's always there and usually helpful if he could suggest something, saying I don't mind wearing men's jeans or paying more for high quality classic denim. He turned to one of his employees and rattled off their codes and brands and a size that wasn't mine. I tried to correct him, having just tried on a bunch I knew the number he said wasn't going to work. But he didn't hear me or ignored me and when the employee came back the sizes were all way way too big and in shiny colours and washes the opposite of what I'd described. I left them in the change room and trundled out, a little disappointed by my once beloved Jeans Jeans Jeans."
18235,2,"I came here countless times for lunch on half-days during my high school years, and  this place was always the premier destination for my group of friends. I always started off with an enormous plate of sushi and some hot and sour soup. Then, I'd go through the dishes and pick heaping amounts of whatever I craved that day. At the end of the meal, there was always buckets of ice cream to try out. \n\nAfter high school, I realized that the quality of the food is fairly mediocre, and I rarely go anymore. However, it's always a fun place to go if you're with a group of people who just want to hang out, relax, and eat as much as you want.\n\nOverall, Crazy Buffet offers a variety of filling food and is a perfect destination for anyone who wants buffet food for relatively cheap."
38669,3,"This was my first time to Sekong By Night.  I have had Khmer food before, which is ironic, as my wife is from Vietnam, but never had Khmer food from Cambodia.  She has to come to the USA to experience Khmer food!!  I have eaten Khmer food in San Francisco CA, and in Siem Reap.\n\nBoth my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Sekong By Night.  It looks like a tiny little forgettable restaurant from outside on the street, but once you step inside. you can see the owner put some thought into the decor.  It really looks Asian.  It is as though the owner went on a shopping trip to Phnum Penh and came back with tons of artwork for the place.  \n\nThe Amok fish is really nice.  Reminded me of a cafe I had dinner at in Siem Reap some 9 years ago when I was seeing Angkor.  The fish was fresh.  My wife wanted to switch with me (she ordered the Katheaw Cha).  \n\nThe Katheaw Cha is also very good.  \n\nI ordered a Coconut Juice as my drink expecting it to be canned.  It was fresh, and smelled fresh (a pleasant surprise!!!)\n\nMy wife ordered the Grass Jelly drink, and it was also good.  \n\nI really wish that this place was in Mesa AZ, as I would go more often.  Maybe so, I will make the drive again to this place from Mesa as appropriate.  This place was a pleasant surprise and I wish the owner great success.  I want this restaurant to succeed.  \n\nThe only place where the Khmer food was better (for me) was Siem Reap, but then it is perhaps a little unfair to compare a restaurant in the USA to what really is available in Cambodia."
23908,3,"My husband, son, daughter and I went for a Sunday lunch. My little girl who is only 2 did not want to sit still and cried so we left so other people could actually enjoy their lunch. Husband went back to pick up our lunch so we could enjoy it at home. We were very pleased. We will be back."
27594,0,"Awful. The service was so-so at best and I believe our server was the owner. She seemed sour and not super friendly. I ordered the corned beef hash and it CLEARLY came straight from a can. It was like mushy, shredded washcloth. The appearance was so terrible I didn't even eat it. Obviously this place has little respect for food. Our toast was cold and the toast was really the only redeeming thing about the place. I took my leftovers because I felt bad for whoever runs the place that it's just that terrible, but I tossed them in the trash on the way home. There's totally a \""we're headed down the tubes\"" type vibe. I will never go back. Definitely go down the street to Bagel Cafe and get their corned beef hash. FAR superior."
7390,1,Not exactly what I would call a great place to eat. If you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it :)
15409,3,"This is one of my favorite places to go browse around in. I don't think I have ever walked in looking for something specific, but always walk out with something. They are like the Walmart of entertainment. Besides being predominantly a book store, they also have tons of games, magazines, posters, cds, vinyls, dvds, blu-rays, posters, you name it. My favorite section is the videogame department; they have everything new and retro, including old NES, SNES, Sega and more. So whenever I'm bored, or looking for cool new-old things, I go to Bookmans."
19648,0,Absolutely the worst customer service you can imagine.  The only thing keeping Verizon in business is the good coverage and over-priced calling plans.

A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!\nThe drinks are so expensive it forces everyone who wants to drink more to drink even more in their room so the alcoholics end up staggering all over the place.  \nWhen I was there last week this group of 10 girls got into this huge brawl which had visual appeal with all the boobage and weaves flying around but in the end it was just sad.\nOn top of that these fools are running around getting b-roll for a TV show.

I don't know how many times I saw the camera crew getting a shot of the bartenders and then shooting some chicks ass while she wasn't looking.  \nThis Hard Rock and Rehab are the height of irony.  A venue dedicated to creativity and musical zeitgeist is the home of mediocre party scenes.\nBOYCOTT"
31530,1,"Cant remember exactly which location I went to but they are all over the fricken place it seems so I am sure they are about the same no matter the location. As one person put it, a PTs is a PTs is a PTs. Anyways, went to Vegas 4th of July weekend 2011 to visit a friend. We were going to see Ralphie May the night I got there so my friend took me to PT's for a bite to eat before the show since this place was close to the casino and it was supposed to be \""fast.\"" Although the waitress was nice, I am pretty sure she forgot about us after she dropped off our food cause we waited around forever for her to refill drinks and just to get our check. PTs is a smoking bar also so if you hate the smell of cigarette smoke, you should not come here. Also, because of this, children (under 18 that is) are not allowed in this bar/ restaurant. \nNo for the food, my friend ordered a chicken sammich which she said was really dry and the chicken was overcooked. I ordered the BLTA which was ok but the bread was toasted to the point of being difficult to bite into and it cut up the roof of my mouth. I was not impressed\nPT's is one of those places that is on every corner in LV it seems and I am not sure why. Maybe they have awesome drinks and drink specials or something because I can't honestly see how there would be such a demand to warrant having so many locations when judging by my experience, this place was crap. The extra star is simply because the atmosphere was clean, our waitress friendly (although still kinda sucky), big water cups so we didnt have to wait for as many refills, and I remember the fries being decent. Other than that, I don't think I will ever understand the appeal of PT's from investors willing to open so many freakin locations!"

30345,2,A nice place for a quick business lunch in Fort Mill or just a quick drive up from Rock Hill. \nGrouper is always nice as is the southern style crab cakes.\n\nService is always pleasant and friendly and have taken the daughter in for a lunch and they are definitely kid friendly.

28079,1,OK I really don't get the attraction outside of the fact that from pure ambiance the place is really nice. Outside of that well overpriced in every way in my opinion.\n\nI'll keep it simple as its be reviewed a bunch so lets deal with the nuts and bolts.\n\nWine List So over priced you can't even begin to or no where to start. Only 1 cabernet on the menu by the glass $25.00 and it was Ahh nothing to write home about. Had a bottle that is about $20.00 retail marked up to 92.00 but better than 25. 00 per glass\n\n3 Appetizers. Fried shrimp quite good best of the bunc Also Mushroom tart that was pure garbage - and a ricotta mini ravioli with farva beans and mushrooms. Sauce was non descript and absolutely nothing special about it.\n\n3 People with 1 bottle of wine and two drinks 3 appetizers and 3 steaks with tax and Tip $456.00 WASTE OF $$$$$$\n\nSteaks\n1 bone in Filet \n1 Bone in Rib Eye\n1 NY Strip\nStrip was best of the bunch but all mean was certainly not tender and the filet ordered Med  / Well came out bleeding and had to be sent back.  1 Order of scallop potoates $11.00 bland and added nothing to the mix.\n\nBottom line OK but certainly NOTHING to write home about and at these prices I was very much disappointed as I had heard so much about this place. really disappointing and much better places to choose to eat in Vegas than this overpriced production.
26458,3,I had a so-so experience at AZ on the Rocks my first visit but due to the absolutely wonderful follow up and customer service I have received since then I am definitely amending my original review. The owner really went out of his way to make sure that my next visit is much better. As soon as my schedule allows I will be heading back to check it out for the second time.
22814,0,"the owner likes butcher your haircut and color, then likes to argue with you on whether or not you lied to her about how you wanted your hair. Not worth the price or the time.  BEWARE!!"
32287,0,"I have stopped at this location TWICE now for breakfast, once last week on Tuesday May 7th, 2013 at 7:48 am and again today Monday May 13, 2013 at 7:40 am and this location has been CLOSED both times. Their hours of operation are clearly posted on the door and on their website as 7:00 am to 10:00 pm. I would suggest with the amount of morning traffic and business that is driving right by that you either open when your hours state, or change the hours to reflect the hours you plan on being open."
22487,1,"I was here in Oct. 2013 and had a guacamole burger.  The burger was very bland, didn't even taste like guacamole and just has no flavor.  Was wayyy overpriced, so was happy I split it with my dining companion.  The restaurant itself is very cute and ambiance is quite nice with the cool surf theme and decor.  The surrounding area is also very nice (Summerlin/Red Rock area), so if you're basically looking for an enjoyable themed place, Islands is nice.  Servers are courteous and helpful.  Maybe other things on the menu are better?  I've had the Kona pie once before and it was good - again, very overpriced, but the portions are big so you can split. That would be my suggestion if you go to Islands - split it and enjoy the fun decor, best of both worlds :)"
48560,0,"The service was terrible. I could hear the servers in their service station all huddled together cussing loud enough for me to hear. Not very classy. Needless to say the food was good, but you can get great meals anywhere in this city. Service is what sets it apart. Not a fan"
42405,4,"Long overdue review. Last time I ate here was almost 6 months ago. I really love the I-Naba chain. Back when I was still living in Los Angeles County, they had a I-NABA in the South Bay area. The one thing I remember about the place was how good they treated my Dad on account of him being such a popular figure in the Los Angeles Japanese-American community. I always thought it was funny how they always kissed his ass and treated him like royalty. At this Las Vegas location, they never heard of him. \n\nWhen people say that I-Naba is the best Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas, I can easily understand why people would say that. This place has introduced a dish which is extremely popular in Japan to the morbidly uncultured people of Las Vegas. Even though I personally believe that Shogu and Hiro's famous \""Sushi-on-Rainbow\"" restaurant is the best and even the most culturally significant Japanese restaurant in LV, I can see why some people may say I-NABA is the bees nees. In fact, I agree that I-NABA is much greater than Ichiza or any of the poke-MON restaurants.  \n\nI love buckwheat soba. I really love buckwheat soba. I have eaten Zaru Soba every single night for the last 6 months. It's a great source of complex carbohydrates, and it helps keep my weight down. If you are a narcissistic pretty boy like me, I really recommend replacing your carb source with buckwheat soba. It gives you that energy you need to workout hard, with the fiber and health benefits as an added bonus.  \nEvery Zaru Soba fan would much prefer to go to one of these soba places that actually have their noodles specifically made for their restaurant. You can get Zaru Soba at Shuseki and Ichiza but they use the same noodles that you get at places like Nakata Market of Japan or Japan Creek Market. Don't get me wrong, I ain't knocking Shuseki. In fact, Shuseki is my favorite noodle house in Vegas, but when you taste the freshly made noodles at I-NABA, you will immediately recognize the difference in taste. \n\nThe girl who works here is really fun to talk with. Last time I was here we had a conversation about Japanese identity. She is half-Japanese/White, and I'm half-Japanese/Korean. So, it was one of the more interesting conversations I have had this year. \n\nI-NABA also holds the unique title of having my very favorite Vegetable Tempura.  The vegetables they use taste organically grown, and they slice them so nice in that symmetrically perfect style. I really like places that make their own Tempura dipping sauce in house. I can only think of 2 other places in LV that do this(SushiTwister and Sushi on Rainbow). \n\nI really wish I could eat here everyday or at least more often. Problem is that I work 60 hours 7 days a week. By the time I get off work this place is usually closed. I heard that they might start opening later when they get their liquor license. I hope it's soon."
40069,2,"I was a Five Guys virgin. First thing about this place - Noisy. I practically yelled my order to the girl and they still got it wrong. Staff was friendly though and I did not send my order back.\nThe burger was good. Cheese melted nicely, meat was juicy and flavorful, bun soft (sesame seed style). I had jalapenos on mine and while they weren't really spicy, they were fresh and tasted good.\n\nFries were ok, skin on, not crispy so much but good potato flavor, still much better than In n Out fries in my opinion. Still prefer my fries crispier though.\n\nOver all, my West coast roots prevail and I still prefer In n Out burgers"
37372,0,"Less than expected.  Chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside, but bland tasting.  I ordered their sauce, but ended up with only ketchup.  Fries were soggy, oily, and horrible.  It took a good 35 min for my food.  Overall, very underwhelming."

4423,0,"Where do i even began, I would recommend  for no one to purchase any vehicle from ANY CarMax! I purchased a car from them and I believe it came with mechanical issues and of course CarMax in my opinion did not try to fix the issue they just brushed it off. The worst part about it is the car salesman that sold me this vehicle after me calling him multiple times telling him the issue DID NOT DO ANYTHING! And his name was RICKEY JORDAN. They are quick to take your money, but when crap hits the fan no one is there to help. No one should buy a car from this place because you might have to deal with headaches and stress!  I would just recommend getting a car from a big car dealer as in Findley or Fletcher dealerships. I put so much money into this and no one there is qualified to help besides take your money that you worked HARD for and run off without a warning. IN OTHER TERMS THIS PLACE SUCKS!

780,0,"I've only been here once, but thought I'd share after reading some other reviews. \n\nFirst off, this is NOT TexMex. I'm not sure what I would classify it as, maybe AmeriMex, but definitely NOT TexMex. \n\nNow that I have that out of the way, I'll say that I like El Cancun. \n\nI do not like this El Cancun. \n\nWhile it looks decent on the outside and the inside, the food and service were simply terrible. Chicken was very watered down, the salsa was flavorless, and the service make a fast food chain look really good. Just a poor, poor experience at this location overall. If this was the only El Cancun in Charlotte, I would feel the same way many posters do and just never come back. \n\nLuckily for me, I live in Rock Hill. There's an El Cancun here. And it's pretty awesome. I won't give it a full on review because this isn't really the place for it, but suffice it to say that if you're in RH and you see the El Cancun and you go \""ugh, no way that place is terrible\"" don't put your experience with the really shitty location on to the one in Rock Hill and give the other one a chance."
3124,0,"This is the first and unfortunately last time I will be visiting the Liberty Market. My idea of a good breakfast is good service and an enjoyable, relaxing time, all three of which I did not experience during my visit. \n\nThe place is utter chaos. When you walk in you think that there are available tables, but then someone comes over to you and lets you know that she is \""seating the table right now\"", and you can order and she will find you a place to sit. That's fine, but a sign near the door stating, \""please wait to be seated\"" would solve about 99% of the \""hostess\"" running around and rearranging people, and 100% of the confusion for first time visitors. They would almost serve themselves better by letting people seat themselves....It was stressful enough to watch the poor girl run around trying to seat people. \n\nOn that note, I saw her let people sit down until she had to seat a party, then she made them get up and stand, which I thought was incredibly rude. She also seated my party of two, and after we sat down, SHE MOVED US! To a smaller table. Fine, we are only a party of two, but once you make up your mind on where you are going to seat a party, keep it, its rude to make them move after they have been seated. \n\nWe ordered our food, I got the Chorizo Quesadilla...good, but nothing great that I couldn't get at other establishments. We even commented to each other how the food should be outstanding...it must be for us to want come back, but again, it was nothing to rave about. \n\nThe food took a long time, and the place is LOUD. The busers are around in flurries setting up and taking down tables, but it's beyond impossible to flag one down to get a box for your food at the end of the meal. \n\nWe left more stressed out then full in our bellies. Granted we visited on a busy Sunday morning, but customer service should always be a companies top priority, here it wasn't. I felt like we got nothing but a stressful expensive meal instead. I rated Liberty Market \""fairly\"" at one star, because like the rating says, I think not. I would not visit again, nor would I recommend to my family or friends."
5784,3,The food was good! Everything was well priced .  I ordered a taco and enchilada .  The kids had Carne asada burrito.  Beans came with the meal we very good. Like home cooked beans.  The meal also come with rice I never eat rice at Mexican restaurants but I ate theirs.  The chips that come before the meal we huge. (Whole tortilla ).   The only down side is they are not by my house.
5332,1,"mm.. it's okay here!? \njust moving from one state to another and getting situated at home calls for a lot of take-out, so i figured... now's the time to really see what's up with these places that are generally new to the area too...

34903,2,"It never ceases to amaze me what people get used to.  Over the years I have clung to people, places and things without even thinking much about it.  When I was a child I had my favorite used needle.  My homeless friend, Sir Albert Bottomtop used to sit with me for hours on a park bench telling me fantastic stories. He told me about the time he stabbed Peter O'toole in the leg after a drinking binge.  How he once walked in on Helen Mirren, a donkey and 20 ping pong balls.  How once he tackled Winston Churchill to the ground and pink bellied him until finally Chamberlin pulled him off and they all laughed. I cried when he told me about mentioning in passing how hot Wallis Simpson was.  Great stories.  \n\nOne day I rode my tricycle to our bench and saw him...he was a beautiful shade of blue. He was clutching a needle. I took it.  I had that needle until I was arrested in Finland for kicking Paavo Lipponen in between the legs and screaming \""this is for cooperating with the Stasi.\"" I smiled before those rotten fish eaters tackled me and my beloved needle fell smashing against the ground. My tears flooded the modern, sleek and tiny toilet in my cell. IKEA sucks.\n\nAfter that was a blur of soda pop bottle tops, used underwear, a bra from Estelle Getty, the first place trophy from the Uganda \""Rock, Sissors, Paper\"" championship, and a stuffed gerbil from an actor I can't legally name.  Suddenly today...I realized that I am still holding on to things that bring me comfort.  I realized after I woke up in an abandoned floral nursery and all I could smell was rotting tulips, goat feces (don't ask), and the smell of carne asada...and I felt the word roll off my lips...Roberto's. \n\nRoberto's...I have mixed feelings about Roberto's...I have had some great meals and some horrible dishes depending on the location...so I am making this review LOCATION SPECIFIC!  If a duck just fell out of your ceiling with 100 dollar bill...LOCATION SPECIFIC...were the secret words of the day. Congratulations.\n\nI want to start with the best thing on the menu...the Carne Asada Chimmichanga.  The Chimmichanga is always good...but one tip...ask for it to be extra crispy.  The shell goes from Conan O'Brien with a slight tan color to Cindy Crawford on a bikini photo shoot color...golden brown but not over done.  Second, never get the steak. I will always say this...Roberto's steak sucks. Get the chicken...or...the best one...the carne asada.  Pork. Crispy shell. Did I say pork? Well, read it again...even the word is perfect...think about how you can use it in a sentence. \""I ate great pork this weekend.\"" OR \""I gave Emma Stone the pork this weekend.\"" Both are beautiful. Both make me want to watch the video of that action with my pants down. \n\nTacos...are great. The Burritos are good if you observe the meat rule, and the shrimp is surprisingly good. The refried beans are good, and the rice sucks. The super nachos (carne asada) are a hangover godsend. The chule relleno are hit and miss. The taco rolls WITH guacamole are amazing. The red sauce is good, but not the best.\n\nRoberto's is like having sex with a 400lb chick with no teeth...sometimes you get lucky and it is great. Sometimes 30 seconds in you wish you were anywhere else.  Drunk is ALWAYS better.\n\nYou dream of Rex. Rex dreams of someone else. You dream of Rex more."

He brought our waters while waiting to order and one of our water glasses was dirty, it had dis colored water in it. My friends ordered food. I didn't. While waiting for our dish we observed the server saving the lettuce that our neighboring table did not use and placed it on the side. I am hoping they are not reusing side dishes that are not eaten by their guests. I don't think I'll be back to this place. I gave it two stars because my friends that did order say that their Korean food was fair and edible."

It got pricey and they shouldn't command that kind of money for the food and service offered. I'm afraid to say that is is bordering on a tourist trap. Sad to see, but their agenda has obviously changed."
34596,0,"Ok, so after hearing so much about this place & checking the reviews, my family and I finally got a chance to check this place out tonight...The drive thru-line was packed & so was the inside. I thought, this place must be great...We got two boxes of The Caniac which included: Cole slaw, Tx Toast, Fries, & 6 chicken fingers...We also got the Sweet tea...My verdict: Bland, Bland, Bland...Wow...I cannot believe how \nseason-less this chicken was...Almost like they just threw it in the fryer...We've had better strips at Chili's...Fries: I love crinkle fries but these had no taste whatsoever...The cole slaw was just plain disguisting...Tasted stale. The Sweet tea & Tx Toast was the best thing in the combo...We drove pretty darn far to get to this place & now I'm pissed that I wasted my gas. Kids ate it but only because they were starving. My daughter said it was ehhh ok....Oh, almost forgot about the sauce which people said they couldnt live without. We even bought extras for $.31 cent a piece...Totally not good. Right now, I'm eating these chicken fingers with ketchup and threw a bunch of season on our fries when we got home...Maybe the other locations are better...."

8035,4,"Found this place about 15 years ago.  You guessed right....a referral.  Been referring and using ever since.  This is a no nonsense - CUSTOMER SERVICE oriented family business.  The staff is the same since the original trip.  \n\nIf you are looking for fair pricing, personal service and no \""extra\"" suggested  upselling, this is a great place for you.

27470,2,"I'd heard a lot of amazing things about this place from friends who live nearby, so I had high hopes when I finally got round to trying it out.\n\nI have to say though, I wasn't exactly blown away. Maybe I'd built it up too much, maybe the memories of how amazing my recent trip to nearby Gourmet Pasta had been were still too fresh, or maybe it was just bang-average. Either way, it was nothing special.\n\nBeing in Brunstfield, it caters for the lunching-out types, and the food wasn't bad. It was just a bit boring, if I'm completely honest. There was nothing on the menu that I couldn't order in one of our student unions, and if I did I wouldn't be paying quite so much for it.\n\nThe evening menu did look a bit more enticing, especially as they claim to only use locally sourced ingredients and the range of dishes to choose form isn't huge, so you know it'll always be fresh. But I just don't know if I could be bothered to go all the way over to Bruntsfield to take the risk. And if I were in this area, I can think of loads of other places nearby that would come above Caf\u00e9 Grande on my list."
23631,0,"I saw this place yesterday, while i was out running some errands. I was very intrigued. The idea was similar to Cheba Hut (which i am a huge fan of) So i just checked it out for lunch and was very disappointed. I ordered the Magic Mushroom Burger with frys. The girl who took my order was very cute, but my burger was extremely salty. This alone \""killed my trip\"". I may go back for a Shasta Cream soda someday. Hopefully the same girl who took my order is still there."
18366,1,"Went here for lunch today and it was just so-so.  I ordered half portobella mushroom sandwich and half black and blue salad.  I love salads but this one just wasn't right.  The steak in it was so chewy.  I took it off the salad but then the salad was still warm.  It had grilled onions and mushrooms on it which I find odd.  I think it's weird to have grilled onions in a salad.  Maybe it's me but it's just not right.\n\nThe mushroom sandwich was soggy and not very good.  Actually the mushrooms were just fine but putting it together in a sandwich with cheese and red peppers just didn't do it for me.  They do not go together in my opinion. Basically, I found both items odd.\n\nThe server was great and the food came out fast I will give them credit for that.  I have been here a few times and this is not a place that I would volunteer up if someone was asking for suggestions where to eat.\n\nSome people love it and some people don't."
23470,4,"I've been to just about all of the Whole Foods locations in the Valley and this one is by far the nicest. They have every natural/organic/gluten free/special diet item you can think of and the selection of organic produce is outstanding! I feel so blessed to have moved to a home within 10 minutes drive to this place :-)  They also have a great selection of ready-made meals and foods. I can't wait to try out the wine bar and $1 tacos!\n\nThe other shoppers can be kinda fancy...I like to go after my workout on Sundays so I feel so underdressed! Haha! It is North Scottsdale, though.... ;-)"

42151,4,"I'm utterly impressed by Packard Place. 5 floors of space, perfectly fit with amenities for small biz developers, big events and anything in need of heavy media focus or support. This is a haven for those craving co-working space or a fitted space to host large meetings. Outfitted with the correct technology, the possibilities are huge. \n\nUpon my first visit a few months ago, I was very impressed by the cleanliness of this space. The 1st floor has beautiful wood floors, large glass doors and windows into many of the meeting rooms and tons of natural light. The rest of the floors have been outfitted with new wiring, cables, internet access, lighting, and newly finished paint. \n\nAnother fun aspect of this building is that each floor has a main floor and also a mezzanine floor. Kind of a play on split level, but it makes it easy to accomplish more with the utilization of space. \n\nIf you're looking for a place to get your start-up off the ground or host a meeting or larger scale event/gathering/business convention, this could be a perfect space."
1138,3,"Pretty good.  Typical sports bar food. Calimari was ok, chili was pretty good, fries were awesome, and the burger wasn't bad.\nMy friend had the bases loaded big unit (as seen on man vs food). It is an insanely huge hotdog with all the toppings. Could feed 3-4 people.\nExpect to pay $15 or so per person."
13527,2,"Even though my friend and I got in without a wait and for free, we didn't have much fun here.  The place was packed with plastic looking people with uber-trendy clothing and fake eyelashes.  You know, which is ok, for vegas and all, but it wasn't what we thought it would be.  The drinks are very overpriced (14$ red bull and vodkas) and in order to sit down, at all (and let me tell you most of us ladies were not wearing the most comfy shoes here...) you would have to be a vip (and to get a vip table you have to buy a bottle - bottles start at 425$).  Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is hott, and the open area upstairs provides a great view of the strip, and this is a place where you just kinda feel like you are one of the rich and famous... We did meet a really nice professional poker champ here, and he did whisk us away to a really fun nightclub in a limo that he paid for, so I guess pure isn't all bad:)"
19138,3,"I know this is a grocery store, but I have to say I'm such a fan of their food, that I usually just go here for a meal. \n \nI don't know whose idea it was to surround the entrance with huge cases of pastels, galletas, and pan dulce, but it works on me every time. Try to resist getting dessert first (but don't forget to save room). It's a good idea to just put your blinders on for now and make a beeline to the Aguas Frescas - they've got the best selection around. All are delicious, but my favorites have to be sandia, mel\u00f3n, or pi\u00f1a. (BTW - you can get a medium (20 oz) for one dollar on Wednesdays!) \n\nOnce you've got your beverage, its time for the really difficult decision. The good news is that you can't make a bad choice, but that doesn't make it any easier. The carne asada tacos, chile rellenos, and gorditas are great, but the torta is the best. Try the carnitas torta - it is absolutely divine and ginormous. Don't forget to pick up a few roasted jalape\u00f1os at the salsa bar for a smokey, spicy kick. Its one of those meals that you get and think there is no possible way you could finish it, but then you probably finish it anyway.  You're better off trying to save half for second lunch so you can get another treat on the way out, because you still have to head back through the pastry gauntlet for dessert. \n\nAgain, no bad options. The churros are fresh, the empanadas are amazing in any flavor, and the orejas dipped in chocolate are actually too big to finish on your own. That's okay though, I'm always up for the challenge. \n\nOh, and since this is a grocery store, enjoy a little shopping while you're there. (As long as you're not in a hurry - everything takes a little longer at Ranch Market.) I pretty much stick to the perimiter - fresh tortillas & chips, quesos, and the largest selection of salchichas I've ever seen are a few highlights."

OUT OF FOCUS ,BLURRY you could barely make out the baby . Gave them 2nd chance. I went at 31 weeks . They messed up again I had the same ultrasound tech she doesn't know how to do her job! Again pictures are horrible . I seriously just threw it away such a waste and disappointment."
29824,1,"I would like to give a better review because I like their food and have ordered from them dozens of times over the past six years.  When done right they make a superb NY style pizza.  However, they are frustrating to patron because they are inconsistent.  Food quality varies widely when delivered as well as delivery times.  Last night it was over 90 minutes for Uptown delivery.  No more.  I gave the order to Fuel Pizza and it was hot and piping at my door 25 minutes later."
1735,2,"We came during a weekday lunch, so they were quite busy. We got seated within a few minutes, no biggie. We got approached by 3 different servers before our actual server came over, which was a little confusing.  \n\nWe ordered a California Roll to share, I got the Prime Rib dip and my mom got a chicken sandwich. The roll was OK, I've had better. The dip was pretty tasty and the fries that came with it were well seasoned and crispy- just how I like 'em.\n\nThe service here was exceptional. The food, considering the price, just didn't really do it for me. For a $50+ lunch, I wish it was a little more memorable. \n\nWhat I did dig tho, were the giant fish outside who practically jump out of the water when you sit by their little \""pond\"" thing. Besides the service, they were my favorite thing there."
49737,1,"Last night was my first time here, and I enjoy Ingrosso.  That aside it was too loud, waaayy too loud.  It was impossible to talk to my friends.  \n\nThe venue itself seems thrown together.  It's too large--now I see why Marquee closes off sections as it gets later and why Light closes the balcony off on slow nights.\n\nYou won't see me here again."
12578,4,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and took advantage of a special deal they had in the middle of summer.I have to admit that I felt pretty baller doing so, as 8 of my friends were sharing another suite while I dropped 3 bills to spend two nights here. Anyway, onward with the review.\n\nThe suites are very luxurious and I can't find much to complain about, other than the bathtub being slightly too small and the toilet area being a little bit creepy (it's very small and there's a mirror inside). The suite is divided into a living room portion and a bedroom portion, both of which are equipped with LCD TVs for your entertainment. The living room area has a huge couch, coffee table, and dining table for you and your guests to drink and chat over. In the interest of time, we had two of our meals there and amused ourselves by drinking bottled water out of fancy wine glasses. Classy. My only other complaint is that the overall layout of it is a bit nonsensical to me, as the bedroom is located closer to the entrance while the living room is in the back. \n\nThe service and staff are top-notch. I had two major issues during my stay here (neither of which are the hotel's fault) and they were quickly resolved. Issue #1: The suite they initially gave us smelled like weed. I called the front desk and they immediately moved me to a new room. Issue #2: Drunken woman mistakenly tries to enter my room at 4:00am. She bangs on the door when the key doesn't work and wakes me up. I call security and she is escorted back to her room down the hall. They are very professional and very respectful toward their patrons. I would recommend this place to anyone if they don't mind walking a bit to get to the hotspots on the strip.\n\n*update*\nAfter staying at a few other places and paying similar prices, I've decided to upgrade this place to 5-star based on the value. No reason why I should pay $100 per night for a hotel room when $50 more can get me a luxurious suite."
36600,1,"There is a time when the price you are charged gives an expectation for quality service and quality food. But stacks and yolks isn't a place of good value or good taste. The servers aren't very nice. They slightly got my order wrong forgetting spinach. But then they brought it out to me for a fee. Orange juice will give you sticker shock, $3.99 for what they call large, which is smaller than a coffee mug"
35770,3,Very fresh and Fast service.The Pho broth is perfect.The food is clean and the place is clean.What best you can expect from all Pho or Vietnamese restaurant.The only thing that did not get 5 star from me is the ambiance.Yes for restaurant is count.
31519,4,"Tropical smoothie is one of my favorite go to places. I always get health nut with soy protein instead. My family has tried almost everything. Everything is good except the sandwiches are smaller than expected. Every tropical smoothie is a franchise, therefore, happy hours and hours of operation varies. This location is the one I go to the most. Happy hour is from 5-7p.m. and it's buy 1 get 1 for $1.99. Tropical smoothie is a Vegas local spot. Check it out!"
20092,0,"I should have followed Yelp's reviews instead of deciding on Dollar's lower rental base price.  They charge for extra drivers, they don't have the car listed on their website, they consider a Chevy Tahoe (Full Size SUV by most other Companies) the same category as a Chevy Suburban (Premium SUV by most other Companies).  \n\nSigned up for the Suburban and given a Tahoe, with not enough room for my travelers and luggage (had to purge some luggage at a relatives home).  This, with the explanation that they consider the Tahoe and Suburban as the same category, and can't do anything about it other than offer me different vehicle that may still not fit my needs.  In addition, the attendants explained that the only Suburban that they have is the one across the parking lot (belonging to the manager!!!!!).\n\n1 star, only because I can't  leave it at ZERO stars!!!!!"
38531,3,"While the place could use a small remodel to spruce up the place, it definitely feels like an art house or indie film cinema. The bar is small but there is plenty of seating to enjoy a glass of wine or beer before your movie. The theater is also small but cozy. Me and the boyfriend had a fun time last Saturday night seeing a very obscure comedy. I would definitely go back!"
48904,2,"I've had this place bookmarked forever, so yesterday on my lunch break I decided to check it out. The inside is small, but homey. You can grab a table and look at the menu, and when you're ready to order you have to go up to the cashier and order there. The cashier was a nice girl named Mikayla. She was working alone and although there were only a few tables, she stayed busy! I looked at the menu for a few before I decided on the angry dog and the euro fries. I paid, just about $14, and sat down and waited. \n\nThe food took about 15 minutes, which wasn't bad at all considering everything is cooked to order. My food came out steaming, a good sign! The angry dog came piled high with spicy bulgogi, jalape\u00f1os, slaw and spicy mayo. I had to eat it with a fork and knife it was that big. The flavors were wonderful. It wasnt too spicy at all, even with all the chopped jalape\u00f1os. That was a damn good hot dog. The fries however, were just ok for me. They came with pork belly, cheese and garlic mayo on the top. I liked the pork belly and the mayo, but probably could have done without the cheese. The actual fries themselves were seasoned and wayyyyy too salty, so that ruined the dish for me. I ended up eating everything off the top and left almost half of the fries. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed everything and I will definitely be back because I want to try the chicken wings and the breakfast."
4058,1,".......Where are the chopsticks?\n\nA Chinese restaurant is clearly not Chinese when there are no chopsticks on the place setting! Tea was lukewarm upon arrival, tasted unauthentic, with the help of any ambiguous American tea bag. The hot and sour soup had peas...peas! Side of rice was stiff and tasted as if it had been in the cooker all day. Had the stir fry vegetable dish that consisted of broccoli, snow peas and mushrooms overly cooked to mush; where was my bok choy or kai lan or any type of actual authentic Chinese vegetables?!\n\nOne thing I do give them credit for: service was clean, fast, and efficient.\n\nOther than that, your money's better off at Panda Express right down the street. Same quality of food, and at least there you won't have to pay for tip!"
26383,2,I thought the brunch was just okay. The french toast was overcooked and the sausage patties were dry. I was starving so I ate it all anyway. I'd give it less stars if it weren't for the great outside dining area.
5971,1,"My fiance and I were really excited to try this place because of the Yelp reviews. I'm not sure if everything we chose was not the right thing to choose, but we were pretty disappointed. \n\nWe started with the Sunrise Spider Roll + Fish egg with tempura soft-shell crab and the crab tasted like muddy crawfish. Maybe not the freshest? It was also really expensive for the portion we received. \n\nMisoshiru was very under-salted. \n\nMy unagi kabayaki was full of bones (I'm guessing this is normal; it was my first time having it) and I spent the entire night picking out pin bones with my chopsticks, which actually really improved my chopstick skills. That was a plus.\n\nMy fiance had the broiled black cod, which he said completely saved his entire experience. I tasted it and agreed.\n\nWhy does fried chicken accompany every meal? It didn't really match any of the flavor profiles of any of our dishes, but it was pretty good taste-wise. Not the best fried chicken or anything, but three little nuggets don't hurt when you're given such a small sushi roll portion. \n\nIdeally, I'd like to try a place two more times before reviewing it, but we will definitely not be coming back. \n\nWe've only tried one other sushi place, Plum, and it's definitely our regular place to go. Until we wanted to be adventurous and try other sushi places. \n\nDisappointed. :(\n\nGood points: Really fast service. We were asked how the food was every half-minute and our table was cleared off after each item was complete. It felt a little rushed but we appreciated the customer service."
44394,3,Service: A+\nLocation: A - Ballantyne\nPrices: B+\nOptions/Menu:  A+\nFood: A\n\nWhat a wonderful place!!  This is something that Ballantyne needs a little bit more of.  We are lacking good breakfast spots.  What makes Toast so unique is their menu and service.  It's not just the typical greasy breakfast spot that rushes you in and out.  You have healthy options if you need them and some extremely delicious dessert'ish breakfast choices.  Like numerous stuffed french toast options and omelettes galore!!  The tomato avocado cheese omelette was superb.  Big and fluffy with all fresh ingredients.  The wife and I will definitely be back and will probably bring some friends.  \n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Ian M.
38797,4,Awesome place!!\n\nDecor is rad feels like Im at someone house in Japan for eats. and just about everything off the menu is delish. I return often!
31266,1,"Last Time we stayed here, they put us near the Construction area, and after getting in after 4am, the loud banging and noise was not welcome at 8am.  \n\nThey also give you a hard time about early Check-Ins, and the pool hours SUCK...\n\nThe Lazy river is great, but the pools were not heated, and we had to deal with a bunch of kids splashing and trashing water all over the place.  \n\nA great spot to vacay if you are bringing along Children."
49799,2,"Food was ok. Really cool concept, but menu is all over the place. It's bbq meets seafood meets sandwiches. I opted for the burger and fries.. My burger was burnt, if we weren't in a hurry to get back home, I would have sent it back. Fries were good. My hubs had the pulled pork sandwich sans slaw and he said it was good, but didn't finish it. Food is a little on the pricey side. It set us back 40$ for 2 sandwiches and two side salads."
7967,0,"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....\n\nLast year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  \""You can't do that.\""  \""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling.\"" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  \""The owners don't allow it.\""  \""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.\""  \""No.  You'll have to put it away.\""\n\nNow.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  \n\nA couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    \n\nI'd kind of like the \""Restaurant Impossible\"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
14896,4,"yep, good ol' simple home cooking, and by 'home cooking' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving.\n\nif you've never gone, don't be scared off by all the butter references, it's not that bad. the place is teeny tiny, and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place, parties of more than four, you'll probably have to get split up. \n\nthe omelettes are wonderful, and the rosemary home fries are too good. the bacon is so good.. i can't even describe it. let me stress i am NOT a pork fan, and rarely eat it. i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i'm so picky about it. everyone raved about it here, so i dived in and thought, 'what have i been missing my whole life?' ha ha, yeah, i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint! seriously, it's unbelievable.\nit's worth the trek no matter where you're coming from, especially on a sat morning. afterward we checked out a small famer's market that was going on right up the street, and then popped in Circles records and tapes, also within walking distance.\n\n***Update 3/8\nI just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes. i was ok with it, but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food, which kind of put a damper on things. def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing."
3642,3,"One of the best public courses in North Scottsdale. It very family friendly and they are used to having young junior golfers on the course. I find the course to be in very good condition whenever we are there. The staff in the pro shop are always pleasant and helpful. The snack bar could be better. It has a very limited selection and it is a little hidden. I doubt most golfers even know that there is one there. Usually we end up going to the restaurant instead, which is great, but does not have a very good kids menu. It would be nice if they had a more elaborate selection at the snack bar for quick and cheap grab and go food."
17470,2,"Time for an update...\n\nWithin the past month I've visited Downtown Cocktail Room three times.  And whether it was through my personal experience or the experience of others in my party, things have left a generally sour taste in my mouth as of late.  There are a few things that have stood out in my recent visits:\n\n-The audacity of a specific bartender.  I always welcome a bartender/mixologists opinion when it comes to recommendations for spirits and cocktails, but this individual comes across as arrogant and presumptuous.  He offers suggestions for DCR-original creations, and then openly admits that all of his recommendations are his own creation.  This came up after a customer had inquired about a drink on the Spring menu, and the bartender said that he wasn't the one who created the drink.  In addition, he ignored a customers request for a cocktail made with a specific spirit, stating that he doesn't work with it; he then waited for the customer to suggest a different spirit base for a cocktail.  As a side note, this bartender also rang up my bill incorrectly during this visit, over charging me for a drink.\n\n-Service.  Waitresses were not immediately willing to seat my party in the back area of DCR.  This was brought to my attention by another member of my party, as I arrived after they had.  They were told that there was no seating available, and we only ended up in the back area because a member of our party asked about it.  Am I to believe we would have been out of luck if we weren't aware of the back area?  Maybe.  After being seated, ordering our drinks, and then receiving our drinks, the waitress asked if we wanted to start a tab.  Standard procedure, that's cool.  Some individuals were done ordering and decided it would be easier on them to pay their portion of the bill now, instead of having their total added to a tab.  The waitress then proceeded to bring out the bill for everyone at the table.  Later in the night, when another party was seated in the back area, the waitress took an empty chair from our table without asking us if it was taken.\n\n-Did you know there was a $20 minimum if you're going to use a credit card/debit card?  I sure didn't.  After going here for the better part of two years, that issue has never come up; I know this because I often don't carry cash, and also usually order only two drinks (which will keep the bill below $20).  However, on a recent visit, I ordered one drink for myself and another drink for a friend, for a total bill of $19.  First of all, the bill was brought to us right after our drinks were delivered.  Really?  You want me out of there that bad?  After handing the bill back with my debit card, the waitress stated that there was a $20 minimum and that they would have to add $1 to my bill so that I could use my card.  My card is Visa; if this establishment accepts Visa, then they also accept all fees due upon Visa transactions from customers.\n\n-Responses to Yelp reviews:  Eight out of the ten lowest scored reviews have received a response from Michael C. of Downtown Cocktail Room.  Not one comment or response, however, was given to reviews over three stars.  It's one thing to step up and address concerns with reviews that you feel are not a valid representation of your business; however these responses avoid the overall commentary of the reviews, and a number of them end with something along the lines of, \""Come by DCR and form your own opinion.\""  Normally I wouldn't nitpick and pull out a statistic like I did above, but it surprised me to hear about the feedback that people had received for their reviews (three stars or lower), while I had not gotten any feedback for my review (five stars).  It's a little disheartening to see all the attention the negative reviews receive, while the glowing reviews from regular customers appear to go unnoticed (until their rating goes down, in which case the deduction of two stars in a review prompted a response that ended with, \""Thanks for all of the past support!\"")\n\nThanks for all of the past support?  Well, your welcome for all of mine as well.  We'll see how things go from here, as I'm sure I'll end up here again; probably just not twice a month as I have in the past."
30674,0,"I give it a 1 for location because I have to. I've been here less than a month and everything I've read, I've experienced so far. Car window smashed the first week. Fire alarms went off for an hour tonight. I've seen 1 cockroach in bathtub. My car was backed into and dented. This is a great area but not a great place to live. I unfortunately moved here sight unseen as I was confidentily reassured by the staff (Alex) that these complaints weren't true. They've all happened to me so far. Only 12 months to go, joy. Positives: nice pool, above average fitness facility for an apartment community and some good people. Live and learn, this will be a 13 month experience.\n\nI wrote the above blurb after the first month but never posted and didn't expect to see it here, so kind of interesting to add the full review below with a one month review. After 5 months I couldn't take it anymore and paid $1200 to get out of my lease and my full review below.\n\nThis place is bad news. Where to start? First week my window was smashed on my Tahoe and nothing was stolen, just $260 to replace it. Second, someone backed into my front bumper causing a nice dent. Fortunately, I have a 2002 so I'm not concerned about needing it fixed. There isn't much parking, making you park in unlit or unprotected areas. I believe the safest area is up by the tennis courts. It was inconvenient, but the problems stopped except for the dent.\n\nIn my 5 months of a 13 month lease, I paid $1200 to get out of here early. The parking is tight, you will get door dings.  The community has useless security guards that basically lock the pool doors. A mouse is more intimidating. \n\nI've heard the fire alarms go off 4 times from drunks in the middle of the night. I've seen two cockroaches in my apartment and they were huge. The garbage area literally almost made me puke in unit E (if you must live here, make sure it isn't by a garbage room). I'd say 50% of residents pick up after their dogs, so crap everywhere. The water pressure in my unit was horrible. The heat and air conditioning is controlled by management. I had to keep my sliding glass door open at night because it was unbearably hot. I had a smoker above and to the left of me so I got to inhale there smoke because I had to leave the door open so I didn't melt. The laundry facilities are NASTY. The water just stands in the machines. If you go inside a machine and shake it you will hear the recycled water. Always check the dryer as people before you don't care about leaving nasty hairs or other nasty stuff behind. Two units in E were constantly broken. The cost is $1.25 and you have to use a laundry card. You lose it and it is $25 to replace. If you don't use it alll upon leaving, the next tenant thanks you. \n\nYour only option for television is DirecTV. The maximum lease you can sign is a 13 month lease, the minimum contract with DirecTV is a 24 month agreement. Getting out of that contract was a nightmare. I typically get contracts when you have a choice, here the equipment is installed and you have no choice. Yet, DirecTV will give you the BS line that they have to account for equipment costs. I am moving into a residence that already has DirecTV and they still didn't let me out of the contract. \n\nLast, I went to turn in my keys today thinking I had paid my rent Jan 1 thinking it was good through my early move out date of 2/6. Nope, and no bill. I find out today I had a $178 worth of rent for 6 days, a $50 late fee and another $40 in $10 a day accruals. \n\nThe community leasing agents will act like they care, but they know they work for a terrible management company with no sympathy for honest mistakes. They kind of just go silent when confronted and pray you walk away. There hands are tied. Two of them are easy to find. they are always outside smoking. Last, I moved in sight unseen over the internet. I was handed my keys and never even given a tour. I had to find everything on my own. The only good thing about it I guess is the location, but I'd find a different location to live in the area. If you want to live in a dorm style community, this is the place. I have lived in many communities over the years and I've never left a place on a sour note. This is the worst 5 months of living I've ever had.\n\nPro's: Location, Gym is decent for an apartment community, nice pool, convenient store. I will not say price because it all adds up in misery."

5018,2,I went to this location yesterday and I was very disappointed. The lady at the drive thru was very rude.
47538,0,"Buyer enjoy...consignor beware.  I've been a loyal shopper for over a year and spent well over 4K in this store.  The staff has always been inconsistent, but I wasn't looking for service, at the time.  Then, I became a seller.  I gave them a few designer items, which they held for nearly a month and still hadn't placed for sale.  I went in 3 days before we were moving out of state and requested my items back, since they hadn't yet been placed on the floor.  Something which is clearly stated in their contract that they will do for a small fee.  I was met with nothing but rude and unprofessional behavior by Ashe, the \""manager\"".  She questioned me about why I wanted them, told me to leave them and then just keep calling to find put when they'd sold so they could put a check in the mail...and more questioning.  When I finally stated I wanted them back period, she told me that could take awhile, since \"" as you can see, we are very busy\"".  I said she had two days to find them, she said that was likely not possible.  She promised a call later that day with an ETA, and I got nothing.  I called the next day, they said she couldn't speak with me but would call me back.  No call.  No help from anyone.  Same the following day.  Apparently, you have to be a hostage negotiator to get YOUR OWN property back upon your request. When I called again to surrender and just change my address with them for the eventual sale...they said they couldn't do that.  Really?\nFrom a matter of principle alone, I would never shop here again, regardless of the fact that I now live elsewhere.  Just ridiculous behavior from any business.  Keep my stuff and my money, Sisters Closet...you clearly need it more than I do.  Hopefully, you use it to pay some folks to work for you that represent your business better."
48658,0,"Went there to play a $5 free slot play coupon through Total Rewards, that I got when I checked in at the Rio. They told me that I had already claimed the free slot play coupon , (I had it in my hand?) I asked them to show me ANY points I accumulated  at that casino, they couldn't because I didn't put 1 dollar in any slot machines. Place is a dump"
44485,3,"Now I had a good excuse to go to the mall. I need to go for early voting! \n \nThis polling place is located inside the mall on the first level out in front of Kohls. It doesn't matter what precinct you're assigned to, any registered voter can vote here during early vote week. The lines were long but there were plenty of election monitors and the polling place here was well staffed and organized. So it was a relatively a short wait in line.\n\nEveryone that I encountered was pleasant and professional. As I got to the front of the line a polling assistant lead me to one of the election clerks sitting at the tables. Since I took the address label from my voter ballot with me, all they had to do was scan the barcode.  You don't have to bring your sample ballot but it does make the process move faster.  Verification is determined by the signature match on file, birthdate and address. Election clerk did not ask for any ID.  After signature verification, I was handed a plastic card and led to the polling area. From there the poll worker let me know which election monitor is available.\n  \nThe election monitors are touch screen and are activated once you insert the card inside the machine. Think ATM machine...that's how these monitors operate.  These screens were super sensitive I noticed.  Just a slight touch of the screen was all it took.  I followed the easy to read prompts on the monitor, made my choices, watched my ballot get printed and made sure it was all correct then casted my vote. Voila!!  It took about 3 minutes total. Your card ejects and as you exit just hand it to the poll worker collecting it.  Another poll worker handed me my \""I Voted!\"" sticker. That's it! Whole process was real easy."
34445,4,"Stick to the pancakes and steel cut oatmeal , and you won't regret it! Came in with the family last weekend for breakfast. Although we ordered a few other things it's not worth the rave. But the pancakes and oatmeal are!!! How can oatmeal be so good? Smooth and creamy.. No lumps at all. Topped with sugar and berries. The pancake was the best I've had from a restaurant! Fluffy and buttery. Sinfully delicious. Ah I'm drooling.."
37944,2,"From all the positive reviews and comparisons to XS, I was expecting a top notch experience.  I was completely let down, but granted, I had high expectations.  \n\nKey tip from this review:  Purchase tickets to whoever the DJ is online through Marquee's website, then make sure to pick them up before 8pm, then you can get in a much shorter line and wait only 10-15 minutes to get in, rather than the 3 hour line.  Plus, it's 30-40 dollars for these tickets which includes the cover, so no need to grease the bouncer when you go in.\n\nGood:\n\nSound system is AWESOME, and the DJ has a pretty sweet vantage point above the dance floor.  There are also plenty of bars which is a plus, but drinks will be their normal expensive self at about 40 bucks for a round of 3 drinks.  Access to outside is very easy and very big with additional bars.  I think the dayclub will be a fun time as all the pesonal suites have individual hot tubs.\n\nBad:\nLayout is terrible for the most part.  The bathroom is literally down some random corridor and is difficult to find.  I only found this one bathroom so I don't know if there are even more.  It is large, but still, you need more spread out.   Crowd-we showed up at 10:15PM and it already was packed and the ratio was terrible.  Plus, there were a curious number of obese people there which I was suprised about given all the comments about the beautiful people.  I just expected more, as in the times of body english where if you paid for bottle service, the ratio would be off the hook for at least an hour and a half.  I think people get here at 9pm since there's so much hype about this place.  \n\nBottle service- If you are considering this, I strongly discourage you.  The quote I received was $1500 and that's for a table outside with a 3 bottle minimum.  They are really milking the hype here and it's ridiculous.  In addition, outside really is a terrible location, maybe in the summer it'll get more traction, but for right now, really no one is out there unless you are getting bottle service.  If you want a table by the dance floor, it's a 8-10K minimum, and I'm not even joking.  I'd go for the DJ tickets online as for now, it's the surest thing.  We had 3 guys with us and got in no problem."

15035,0,"This is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas, but why did I only give this place 1 star?!? Because of the AWFUL experience I had in March 2011. I took my girlfriends here to eat on a Saturday afternoon, excited to fill my stomach with some French delicious-ness. We got through the line and we waited at the front to be seated. I felt that we were standing there for an eternity before we got seated at an awkwardly placed table that faced the line. Basically, everyone in line could stare at us as we ate. We felt uncomfortable and asked this waiter named DANRICK (tall, dark Philipino male) if we could move to a more secluded table under the faux trees. DANRICK gives us a look and tells us that the area we requested was reserved for VIPs (which was understandable). He then goes on to say that we can go back to the end of the line to request to be seated in the VIP section. I said, \""No, that's not necessary,\"" but he continues his tirade by picking up our receipt and pretends to take it to the front so we would have to go back in line. I repeated that we were fine where we were and eventually he went away. I have never been so UPSET at the service I received. I even complained to our waitress, who acknowledged that he was like that and she apologized for his behavior. DANRICK'S behavior was inexcusable and intolerable. He ruined our day and he needs to be fired."
25416,1,Got the burger of the month.  Was good but not exceptional.  The menu is a little pricy for the quality and service.
26600,2,"Honestly I wanted to love this place but I just couldn't...my boyfriend and I went here a week ago for a late lunch/early dinner, the service was fantastic. The guy with the glasses that served us was super attentive and sweet, made sure we were takin care of. I ordered a BLT sandwich and some fries and my boyfriend ordered a burger and a salad. He said he really liked his meal even though his burger looked a little strange to him. His salad was delicious, I ate more of it than he did. My BLT was kind of gross, chewy, nasty bacon and the bread hurt my mouth. The fries were good, ate them all. Maybe I just need to try something different next time I go here. A lot of people seem to love this place and I want to make sure I try it again. Oh and the beer on tap was kind of expensive."
14845,2,"The Rio buffet was my most anticipated buffet. I got the pass ($45 for 24 hr hour access to six buffets). We had a party of ten and got seated into a small room. First thing I got was prime rib, decent but not seasoned like it was at Paris buffet. One thing I enjoyed was the noodle soup bar. You can order udon, pho, Tom yum noodle soup and some others. I tried the udon which I heard was the best and it was. The Tom yum soup was good but they gave the super thin rice noodle which was slightly powdery. A good variety of food and there were crab legs and shrimp. The crab stuffed sole was delicious. Dessert bar was decent. About the same items as the other buffets, with the chocolate shell tarts (but these had fruit) and coconut cream pie. All in all, not a bad buffet but not as great as I had hoped. I liked the Paris buffet and planet Hollywood much better."
31968,4,"I was recently in Charlotte for business and my cousin joined me so we could celebrate her very important 50th birthday. I wanted to find the perfect place for pampering and relaxing and Verve was it! From the beautifully decorated and welcoming property to the warm and inviting staff members, this was the right spot for the occasion. The owner, Verbena, was very accommodating. From the fabulous signature pedicure to the gel manicure, we were treated like queens. The other staff members were equally wonderful and all helped make the day special for cuz. I couldn't have asked for more, and I'm picky when it comes to my pampering.\n\nIf I haven't convinced you yet to check out Verve, you MUST go check out the pedicure massage chairs. They make you forget all of your troubles. Oh how I wish I could get one of those chairs for my home! I'd be a very happy and satisfied recluse. Thanks for a wonderful day, ladies. I will return."
31594,0,"I was trying to wait till I tried this place again, but decided eh, why not just write it now. The restaurant is located inside the Wild Horse Pass. The food is delicious too bad the service SUCKS big time! We had a plethora of appetizers and not one of them let me down. Our party was big so the service sucked at the worst time. They took our orders in order, then when serving the entire meal; each dish was yelled out by the servers deli style and then handed to our guests to place on the table themselves (if we wanted to serve ourselves we would have done a buffet). They did it very rude too. My plate was supposed to be served sizzling, but somehow the waiter forgot to serve it, as it sat on the table next to us for 5 minutes, then served lukewarm. On our way out (to dance) I witnessed the bartender reach into the ice bin with the actual glass she was serving the drink in (isn't this a violation?). I wonder if the service sucks because the menu is so affordable and delicious they are counting on return business? non the less I won't be back."
9859,3,"I dont know why everyone bashes the excalibur. I recently stayed here and it was great. Everything was clean, nice flat screen tv, walk in shower. Got upgraded for free too. :)\n\nThe pool was off the hook!"
19161,4,"I love this place!  It is my \""go to\"" when my husband is out of town. The Chicken Souvlaki plate is my favorite!  I went to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant last night and the Souvlaki wasn't nearly as good as Mr. Gyros, and it cost almost twice as much! I live in Anthem but am originally from the Detroit area, where there was huge Greektown, so am very familiar with how the food should be. The Chicken Souvlaki plate comes with a very nice, fresh Greek salad with generous feta cheese, two big juicy scewers of chicken, a nice portion of rice and a fabulous pita bread...yum!  If you call ahead they will have your carryout order hot and ready! Support your local eatery, and you won't be disappointed! The service is always pleasant and the place is clean!"
34124,0,"This place is an embarrassment. \n\nAwful service and disgusting food, what a delightful combination at this price. I wish i took a picture of their eggplant pizza, there was a total of four bites that had eggplant on it.\n\nWolfgang puck is a crook and should be ashamed of his hustle."
36753,1,"Very mediocre and just cashing in on Mario's name.  The pasta with mussels dish (which the moron server called clams) had mussels that never should have been served to anybody.  The \""served\"" a couple slices of bread with no butter or olive oil and were indifferent to any requests.  Nice location, but that's about all."
34670,2,"Place was clean and had a modern look. Ordered the tonkatsu ramen with pork.  The ramen came in a large bowl with all the fixins (bean sprouts, green onions, carrots, and spinach) which I really did not care for. The broth was flavorful, the pork was tasty and plentiful, and the noodles were very good. Overall, very satisfied as I was craving ramen.  I would definitely come back."
45474,3,"Great food, quiet ambience. Everything tasted like good quality, the fish, the bread. We went on the night before a major hurricane warning when it was quite empty, so I can't say what the noise level was really like on an average night. When searching for the restroom, it was strange how one of the hostesses quickly asked where I was going, as if I might run away with the fine china."
16775,1,"We went to Mirage's buffet for dinner last night. It was very disappointing compared to Bellagio we went the night before.  They had a poor variety of foods.  The  broth of the Asian wonton noodle soups was so plain and tasteless. No sashimi, only some sushi rolls.  Dessert selection was so poor.  Fruits were all diced up in small pieces. The price was $24.95 + tax= $26.95.  Will not come back."
36738,1,"Stale bread, WAYYYYYYY to expensive for what they are really offering.  If you want an expensive Jewish Deli, go to Chompies.  At least their pickles and food are good!  I have been to Archie's 3 times, apparently because I am a glutton for punishment and they are close to my work...  Over and over again, too expensive, not fresh or flavorful, and this time we even had a poor waitress.  Poor girl, probably couldn't get behind the terrible and overpriced food..."
37007,1,Food came out 30 to 40 min later and the whole fish never came. Took forever to sit us as well even though no one was in line.  Pad tai taste worst than middle planet
47233,4,"The food, the ambience, and the service is amazing! We had been here once before, but we sat at a booth, so we felt like a second experience was needed before I wrote a review because we wanted to try something different this time around by sitting at the Hibachi tables. Just like the first experience, our second time here was just as amazing! Everyone is so friendly, our server was incredibly helpful by giving great suggestions and answering all of our questions, our chef was so entertaining, and the manager was very kind. We enjoyed the Hibachi table just as much as we enjoyed dining the first time we were here. We left happy and completely stuffed. We will definitely be back again! :)"
113,4,What a place. What a selection.  I love it.  \n\nThis place allows you to view hundreds of beers from around the world.  You can buy mixed six packs as well. \n\nThe food is great and service is just fine.
43196,4,"I really like this place...\n\nA quick visit to the website will describe a lot about this place and the passion/vision of the restaurant and its owners. This is very fresh, very authentic, very delicious Thai food. The restaurant is clearly in its very early opening stages. What is refreshing about the experience is that they are open and transparent about the fact and they will take the time to address the obvious kinks and give you the exact date for their resolution. Their (currently) limited menu is sure to point out that it's a temporary menu being offered only until their Grand Opening which is yet TBD. The ambiance was relaxing yet lively and vivacious. I was there for lunch and groups of people seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely and highly complimentary. I was immediately impressed by the menu; it seems as if someone identified all the best Thai dishes around the city and put them on one menu. I had the shrimp Pad Thai (which i believe should be the starting point and litmus test for any new Thai food experience), the shrimp were perfectly cooked, fresh and incredibly seasoned. The garnishing of incredibly fresh and crunchy bean sprouts along with the light dust of Thai seasoning added excellent texture and depth to the dish. The incredibly fresh green onion slivers added beautiful color and a sharpness that complimented the sweetness and spiciness of the dish perfectly. In all i found both the experience and the food to be fantastic; this notion was only exacerbated by the cordial and personal interaction of the manger (which btw is the tried and true key to long-term success on Murray Ave.) and the resourceful and friendly wait staff. \n\nFor those looking for a great new place to try and fantastic, authentic Thai food, Curry on Murray is a must try!"
7828,1,"5-27-13 Memorial Day. We were the first people in the restaurant at 6am. I ordered huevos rancheros and my friends ordered biscuits and gravy. All three of our orders came out luke warm at best. We were the first orders in, no one else was in the restaurant. $41 for breakfast was not worth it. Did we tell our server you may ask? No we did not. We are in the industry as well and didn't want to be a bother. The service was fine but the food was sub par. In my experience in the restaurant industry I understand mistakes happen, orders are messed up, and food is sometimes cold. However when you are the very first order of the day there is no excuse."
48271,2,Ummm just ok by food and setup but service was fabulous and there was no waite and yes the karaoke was fun to watch ... Not sure if I'll be back but I won't say never
12354,3,"A group of friends and I met in Las Vegas for the Halloween weekend, as we had in 2009.  We again chose to stay at NYNY, due to our experience last time which was pretty stellar.  Once again, we had a great time.  This hotel/casino is pretty classy, without being ridiculously expensive (i.e. Bellagio, Wynn).  I booked my room no more than 2 weeks in advance, due to not being 100% sure I'd be able to make it this year, and still had 3 nights for $500.  Sure, there are cheaper places to stay on the strip, but NYNY offers the glitz and glam of some of the ritzier places without the super-heavy price tag.  Book earlier and I'm sure you can get a very decent room rate.\n\nThe casino itself covers a lot of floor space, and it really does feel like a miniture version of New York City in there.  Last year, they had $5 blackjack tables on weekdays (except Fridays), but apparently now they have converted over to minimum $10 tables, according to one dealer.  I guess that's my only real \""complaint\"".\n\nThere are plenty of resturaunts, clubs, and bars in this hotel to entertain yourself if you don't feel like venturing out of the hotel.  I never rode the rollercoaster, but some friends told me it was pretty fun.\n\nFor the most part, the staff and cleaning crew at NYNY are friendly, helpful, and polite, which is refreshing for a place that caters to many thousands of people a night.\n\nI may try staying somewhere else next time in Vegas, simply to add a little variety, but NYNY comes highly recommended by me."
14762,1,"What do you expect when you see a sign for All You Can Eat Sushi for $19.95?  Less and mediocre food right?  Well that's what I expected and that's what I got! The sushi was blah and there was waaaaay more rice in the sushi rolls than there was actually fish.    So, don't get the all you can eat sushi deal unless you don't care how it tastes.\n\nOn the other hand, my friend ordered miso soup for $4.50 and that sucker was HUGE....not the typical small miso soup bowls....so that was cool.  \n\nI skipped the sushi because I had an inkling it was going to be wack, so I ordered the Ah Sin Fried Rice (which was kinda wack too....not very flavorful at all).  I also ordered the Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) and it was surprisingly good....I've had better...but it was good.  \n\nOh and they charge you for hot tea ($8 for a pot that serves 5 people easily)."
47956,4,"For the TS (Town Square) Location:\n\nCame in with a party of 5 and was seated right away. It was extremely busy for a Monday night so you know the place is desirable. Inside looks amazing, has a nice  white bar and table tops with gorgeous chandeliers down the back wall. We got an Almond Joy martini,a S'mores martini, Blue Ocean Goblet and a Passion Punch Goblet as well as a classic Margarita. SO GOOD!! all this drinks were very tasty (their specialty) \n\nFor apps we got the baked brie, popcorn shrimp and a bruschetta and two of the girls got french onion soup to start; all of which were amazing! Usually bruschetta  and french onion soups are hit or miss, well Sugar Factory's TS were definitely A HIT.\n\nNext came a Tuna Melt, Tuna Tuscan Salad,Bleu Cheese Bacon Burgers and the best grilled cheese sandwich ever, had 4 different cheeses in it! \n\nPlus they have candy, lollipops and merchandise you can purchase before you leave!\n\nThe food was great and the service was well above anything else I've experienced at Yard House or Brio. Would definitely recommend to any local or tourist in Town Square for the day, GO TO SUGAR FACTORY TOWN SQUARE, so good!!! A+"
35552,3,Love it.  I can share because of larger portion.  Good meat....good everything.
25773,2,"Brutopia is good for beer, but stop there.  Love that they brew their own stuff.  IPA had a good amount of hops and bite.  Reasonably priced at $5 during happy hour. Stay away from food.  First sign should have been that the food menu is labeled as an \""international menu\"" and has everything from samosas to edamame.  what bar in montreal has food but doesn't have poutine?!  we ordered the chorizo nachos which was a terrible idea.  soggy nachos without flavor and ground chorizo instead of nice chunks on top.  ugh.\n\noverall, my mistake on the food.  avoid the food.  stick to the beer.  you'll be pleased."
26017,2,"Somewhat of a mixed bag. Our party of 4 was seated immediately (it was slow), on a Sunday night. We ordered Thai iced teas, and browsed the menu. The teas took rather a long time, given that it was a slow night. The service overall was polite but very slow. \n\nOur main courses all were served over the span of about 10 or 12 minutes - that is, the first dish arrived, then 2-3 minutes later, another dish, another pause, then another... It made those of us who did not have their meal yet feel all the hungrier.\n\nI had the Ginger Heaven, spiced 4 on a scale of 1-5. It was tasty and I enjoyed my meal - though I didn't feel it was exactly 4/5's of the way to maximum spice. My son enjoyed his dish as well, which was a basil and chicken entree. I can't recall the exact name.\n\nThe curry was another story. The rest of our party had red curry with tofu and yellow curry with chicken, at 3 and 2 stars of spiciness, respectively.\n\nBoth curries were very bland, and too sweet. Neither person finished their dish, nor did they want to. Not a trace of heat in either dish, and I was surprised that the curry was simply not very flavorful. In fact, I'd have a hard time telling the difference between the yellow and the red curry... they both tasted about the same.\n\nI doubt I'll go again anytime soon, but if you do go, I recommend staying away from the curry dishes."
17223,0,"I got food poisoning here last week ... and the MGM has been less than helpful in recovering the costs of having to change my travel plans, etc.  I have never been so sick."
40589,1,The food quality has worsened a lot in recent months. Must be a new chef. Almost every dish has less taste and less meat. Too bad.
38559,4,Francesca has an amazing vision for all things skin. Pricing is competitive and she has great monthly specials as well.On top she's a total sweetheart!! I couldn't imagine going elsewhere.When i find something that works I stick with it. Love her!!!
22335,3,"This hotel was so luxurious, large suite and comfy!! It is part of the Venentian so everything is connected and easy to go gamble and go shopping.  The room was decorated in dark chocolate tones and a dark yellow/gold couch that was so nice! The room in only like a couple of month old so everything was nice and new!  The bathroom had a huge tub that was so amazing in granite and nice thick towels!! I just loved coming back to my room after a long day at the a sales conference. \n\nThe only thing I did not like was the pillows since they were a bit too thick for me.  I loved the 3 TV's in the office area, in front of the bed and in the bathroom!! Place was super clean and nice we had chocolates every night with a turn down on our bed.  I would highly recommend a stay there!"
33969,4,Another win from Sing Sing. Emailed them a pdf at 6pm on Thursday. Got a quote and a proof back at 6:15pm. 2x3 custom foam board was done by 2pm the next day. 20hr turnaround. Not. Too. Shabby.
37635,4,Awesome veggie burger! Cant think of a veggie burger I enjoyed more.  Everything we ordered was delicious.
24655,3,"Thank goodness for yelpers leading me to this hole in the wall. \nThe reviews were right on.\n\n It was an authentic Korean joint with traditional rice/meat dishes. No ji gaes or pan chans.  It's Korean fast food at its finest. \n\nThe restaurant is small, but there is seating available. \nThe big added bonus was the free hot sake after 6 pm. \n\nI got the spicy squid rice bowl. Could've been a little less spicy. \nI enjoyed it overall. \n\nThe service is great. The options are varied enough, and the prices are good!"
320,4,"They have the best Burnt Almond Torte, so Good!   And if you like lady locks their the best I've had also.  Another of my favorites are the little cake cups they make .  There are a variety, like Burnt Almond Torte, Cookies and Cream, Pumpkin cheesecake, Vanilla Raspberry, German Chocolate, and so on.  Its the perfect miniature dessert!\n\nFor my daughters wedding I ordered five dozen of these for the cookie table. They were a nice addition to the cookies and display beautifully.  They were a Big Hit!"
14992,3,"Came here for the sunday champagne brunch.\n\ndecent variety of foods from chinese, salads, mexican, breakfast, seafood and even brazillian bbq style meats. I stuck to plenty of pork(bacon, sausage, polish sausage, italian sausage with peppers) and general tao's spicy beef along with other assorted yummies here and there. Only thing that sucks is you now have to pay extra for the all you can drink champagne extravaganza. \n\nAfter a night of drunken shenanigans, here we were getting drunk all over again for breakfast, good times. It's vegas, I think it's a written rule somewhere that this is supposed to happen...\n\nFrom here, off to circus circus blitzed..."
1199,4,"Disney Land for Foodies. Fresh Baked Goods, Salsas, Mexican dishes (the torta cubana is to die for) and an awesome atmosphere, plus more produce than the human eye should ever behold. My favorite place in Phoenix."
34738,2,"This place has really gone downhill in the last decade compared to what else is out there.  The hotel hallways and rooms are no different than your typical Holiday Inn on an interstate in the middle of nowhere in the U.S.   Casino is in good shape but when you stroll through Bellagio, Wynn, Venetian, etc. it's just not the same here.  Even the walkway to Paris lets you know how \""dated\"" Bally's is.\n\nOnly plus is the pool is decent and maybe the Sbarro breakfast downstairs is fast."
23764,2,"Brio did a wonderful job with my bff's wedding reception, so for that, they get 3 stars.\n\nBut the gluten-free pasta primavera was hard, chewy and bland and the mushrooms tasted microwaved. And the server only mentioned the complimentary reception wine after making it appear like you could only get cocktails (which were not included with the wedding reception). Y U HOLD OUT ON ME?"
19422,1,"The price tag for the Jimmy Dean Delights turkey sausage bagels said $5.99.  After I got home, I looked at the receipt and noticed I was charged $7.19.  Thanks for the false pricing, Target.  I think that's illegal, too.\n\nI'm going to think Twice before I go back to Target.  Might go ahead and close my Red Card too.  Not worth the 5% discount to get overcharged."
34313,2,"What a quirky little bar this is. I'd been warned beforehand that you need to book a table (odd for a pub) and sure enough, when we walked in the waitress asked if we needed a table. Luckily we were meeting friends.\n\nAs others have said, it's like an extended living room with lots of mismatched sofas, rickety chairs, and everyone kinda sprawled out in one open area.\n\nThe cocktail menu was extensive, they had seasonal cocktails (nice touch) and the two I tried were both delicious.\n\nThe only problem was it's table service, and it takes a hefty long time to get someone's attention. \n\nRight now, this place is very middle of the road for me. I like the atmosphere, I like the cocktails, table service slow, table booking a pain. I'm going to come back and try the food though - that'll swing it for me. I've heard good things about the parsnip fries...!"
8557,3,great salads and their fries and chips are to die for.My friend's love their grilled cheese (not on the menu) and i've always had awesome. service. Great place for lunch and a good beer!

36299,3,"An old diner feel and breakfast served anytime- how could you not love this place?!\n\nI have a super hard time trying to decide what I want when I go to Mattie's Diner. Why? Well, I kind of want to order everything. That's a good problem to have at a restaurant. Open face turkey sandwich, tuna melt, all the variations of loaded fries, the big holla (it's like a grilled cheese on steroids), breakfast... I've never had anything bad here. During our latest trip here, my friend Andrea got the cheeseburger wrap. It looked incredible. I will definitely be ordering that during my next visit. \n\nWe also discovered something new on this latest adventure to Mattie's: Chrissy's Buffalo Chicken Dip. Reido talked about this the entire drive to the Diner. When we got there, the rest of us were distracted by a mini cooper outside filled with stuffed animal dogs (I'm confused too... some kind of contest promotion). Not Reido. He went right inside and ordered the dip the minute he sat down. It was delicious. I think the best part of it is the homemade pita points that come with it. I could eat those by themselves.\n\nA long list of shakes, malts and floats. I try to save room for these, but I tend to eat way too much food. These also have a fried oreo sundae. The only thing that can make an oreo even more delicious is to fry it. \n\nThe service is quick and friendly. There's one super sweet server that I swear must be there every single hour of the day. I always see her. Does she ever get a day off?!\n\nTons of free parking. The place is kind of small inside, but there is also outdoor seating as well. It can be tremendous people watching depending on what concert is at The Fillmore that day."
48028,2,"It was okay, very clean, nice atmosphere but the food itself was a little disappointing."
46378,4,"What an incredible place! Everything you need and want, is right here at the World Market. I had such a great time here looking at vintage toys and browsing the international food selection.\nBe sure to ask for the rewards card, if one of the friendly cashiers forget to suggest it. Remember, with this reward program it isn't necessary for you to carry around a card. Also, at this particular location there is wine tasting available on Saturdays from 1-3pm!"
31585,4,"The owner is there every day and he takes his food seriously. He loves for people to come in and it shows.  The burgers are just so good! Hot Juicy and Tasty. The milkshakes are to die for. My husband generally hates takeout, but even he loves this place. I highly recommend Lobby's Burgers."
44276,3,"OK, so it's been almost a year, and felt this review was worth of a +1 star update! \n\nMy Coach and I were ousted (OK, more like had our training slots cut from the schedule) from the gym a few doors down. Ended up training closer to home in Chandler, which is much more convenient when you lift/workout 3-4 times each week.  \n\nWell, three of the coaches ended up opening up their own gym, so once again, I find myself in Maricopa one day a week. \n\nSwung by Honeycutt Coffee last Saturday for a post workout iced toddy. Decided to spruce things up with a pump of Salted Caramel and a splash of cream.\n\nI really enjoyed the taste of this. Strong toddy, and the Salted Caramel was decadent without being cloyingly sweet (like Starbucks beverages). \n\nAnother nice barista; enjoyed chatting with this gal. I barely had time to \""Yelp Creep\"" and take photos of the lovely d\u00e9cor before my drink was up! \n\nHoneycutt Coffee is just what Maricopa needed. It's a breath of fresh air compared to all the big coffee chains, and especially in what appears to be just another dingy strip mall. \n\nLook forward to coming back many more weekends with my lifting crew!"

39162,1,"When I was unable to open the front door to get into O'Aces, I should have recognized it as a sign that breakfast at O'Aces should not happen!  I pulled on the door several times, and then I walked out the entry way to see if there was another entrance.  No, there wasn't.  Back to the door.  A few more hard yanks and someone from inside came and opened the door.  I had gone brain dead over the fact that video poker bars/restaurants like this lock their doors for the overnight and morning hours as a precaution.  I never thought to look for the buzzer nor was there a sign anywhere saying to use same.  \n\nI did get in, however, and the first thing that hit me was the smell of cigarette smoke both stale and fresh and there was only one customer in the place.  From the reviews, I had expected some, but I got a full shot.  I walked into the restaurant area.  Under the Nevada Clean Indoor Act these places were to be separated from the smoking bar areas with enclosures.  They had the doors, but they were wide open.  Perhaps the the Legislature changing the law during its last session, O'Aces may not need to have the area sealed from the bar.\n\nThe waitress brought my menu.  There was a limited number of items on the breakfast section and I chose the 4 egg sausage and cheese omelette.  I got hash browns and my choice of toast was their sourdough.  Coffee was brought quickly and was refilled once during the time I was there although I was asked a second time.  Since I was fooling with my phone, the waitress asked if I needed more time before ordering and I said, \""Yes.\""  She left and then it was a wait for her to come back.  I think she knew I was a special case (see getting in the front door above.)\n\nThe order was placed and then I waited.  About 15 minutes later, when I was thinking that I had certainly made the wrong decision in choosing O'Aces, the cook brought my breakfast to the table.  He then looked for the waitress because I think he'd been waiting for her to come pick up the order.  Now, there still are only two customers in the place--me and the guy smoking and drinking at the bar.\n\nThe omelette was OK.  Nothing special.  It was like they cooked one small sausage link, cut it into small pieces, and then mixed it with canned cheese and put it on the omelette before folding and plating.  It was no 4 egg omelette.  I've made bigger with only two eggs.  It was filling and it got me revved for the Make A Wish Run so it fulfilled its purpose.\n\nI then had to wait a fair amount of time for the check to be brought.  There were still only two people in the place, me and...well you know who.  I put bills in the check holder and I got up and walked toward the bar where the waitress was in deep conversation with the guy at the bar.  That's what had kept her from doing her other work in a timely manner.  I handed her the folder, made my way to the door, pressed the button to unlock the door (see I'm eminently trainable), and out I was into the fresh air.\n\nI made a mistake going there and I knew it at the front door.  Live and learn!"
29066,2,"I read the previous reviews before writing mine.  Ouch.\n\nMy experience was just fine.  I had a mocha.  It was good.  I've had better, I've had worse.\n\nThe service was pretty good.  I didn't look to closely at the pastry selections which several other reviewers mentioned as a problem.\n\nBased on my mocha, I would return.  The atmosphere was nice in & out and in the nice weather the outdoor seating area is pretty inviting."
37434,2,"We tried this theater for no other reason than it was close and it was playing a children's movie (Mars Needs Moms). I knew nothing about it before we went. \n\nUnfortunately, the new spring training complex behind the theaters was not built to include parking for fans, so the Pavillions parking lot also doubled as a baseball parking lot, and it was packed the night we went. There were parking attendants stopping cars heading towards the theaters, trying to charge $5 for parking. When I explained that we were just going to the movies, I got a puzzled look, but he let me through without paying. \n\nI don't remember the exact ticket prices, but it was $26.50 for two adults and one child, which seemed about normal for a non-matinee movie. We then went to the concession stand and ordered a small bag of popcorn, two pretzels and two drinks, which totaled $27. A bit on the steep side for my liking, but whatcha gonna do? \n\nThe pretzels were frozen and needed to be cooked, so the clerk offered to bring them to us in the theater, which was a first and a very nice surprise. He was very friendly and helpful, and bringing us the pretzels just proved the point. \n\nThe theater was very clean, and I really like the renovations they made. I LOVE stadium seating, but the 3-D movies I can do without. My daughter seemed to enjoy it though, so I guess there is a market. \n\nAll in all it was a decent experience. I didn't have any of the problems some of the other reviewers had, but I did think that spending over $50 for a movie and basic snacks was a bit extreme. \n\nI also tried the demo of the moving theater seats, and I will definitely be avoiding those theaters. I'm sure it sounded good on paper, but it just made me want to puke and in no way would it ever enhance my movie experience."
23074,1,"At most buffets I at least leave feeling full, unfortunately I can't say the same for this one.  While there is a large quantity of different food options, the quality makes many of those options inedible.  There were a few different things that I was able to eat but for the most part I filled up on the desserts and not the actual food."
28898,2,"One of the \""alrights.\"" Their nigiri sushi is always fresh. The slices of fish are on the small side but I've never eaten a bad roll here. Once, I ordered a Caterpillar roll and they actually made it look like a caterpillar. :) sweet guys behind the sushi bar!! Kaya has an awesome variety of sushi and appetizers. They have the best baked mussels in town and they even have a number of grilled skewers and Korean foods on their AYCE menu. Bulgogi, kimchi fried rice.\n\nThis place is great to come with a friend, by yourself, or with a group. The servers here are very nice as well! My friends and I have had 3 group events here and the girls remember us! Then again, How could they not, we're loud and rowdy when we get together and the group room is outfitted with tambourines and karaoke!! \n\n\nSplitting checks is NOT a problem here! They'll do it 13 ways if they have to. So for parties, don't stress about splitting the bill!"
29343,3,"We have been into see Dr. Alazard three time for my newborn and everything has been wonderful so far. The one thing I've noticed is that they take people in the order they arrive. I can see other patients appointment times, and even though they're after ours, they get called first. Guess it pays to get there early! The desk girls on the well side are super sweet, the one I talked to on the sick side was a bit short but she may have been busy. The nurse has read the scale wrong twice now for my sons weight, but it doesn't change his percentile so it's not a big deal. We love Dr. Alazard and will continue to see him for our appointments!"
32972,2,"A clerk once agreed with me that Walmart corporate might have forgotten this store exists.\n\nMaybe it's left over from one of the corporation's many, many re-sizing experiments, as this is sort of a Walmart Junior. There is no sewing section, and the craft section is one half-aisle of \""kids crafts.\"" Every other section also seems smaller than usual. If you're thinking about a fatty, salty snack to ease your shopping experience, get it outside the store, as there's no snack bar.\n\nI'm going as high as three stars because the store is clean and quiet every time I go, and the clerks seem less beaten-down than at larger Walmarts. At 7:30 on a weekday morning, it's a fabulous place to go if your need to meditate in solitude overlaps with your need to buy cat litter or other household basics."
6963,0,"Our us airways flight from Santa Barbara to Phoenix was on time, smooth, without delay and renewed my faith in the idea of flying versus driving, etc.   \n\nHowever, my return flight shook my faith in this mode of transportation. We arrived to check in at sky harbor only to be told that it was too late to check in.  Our flight was for 5:49pm. It was 5:10pm.  We were told by our eye-fluttering attendant typing at the keyboard with a fake smile that we needed to arrive at least 45 minutes prior to departure.  We lost are already paid for seats.  Resisting the urge to grab him by the neck and bang his head on the counter to see what would fall out, I politely asked for options which he responded with two: 1) wait until 9:00 pm to fly standby 2) or depart the next morning at 8:30am.  Not wanting to wait fora hours to see if we could board an oversold flight, we chose the latter option. \n\nWhen we arrived in the morning to a chaotic crowd of passengers, there was little direction by us airways employees.  Instead they only contributed to the chaos by giving vague directions.  They wouldn't last five minutes in my classroom.  Clearly some employee training is overdue here. \n\nWhen we finally checked ourselves in, we faced gates changes, delays due to maintenance, and an ever increasing amount if disgruntled travelers surrounding us.  I'm glad it's over.  No more US Airways."
10213,4,"Such beautiful interior decoration, it's surreal.  Any other venue will look cheap after you have set foot in the Wynn.\n\nI had spaghetti bolognese in the Wynn's little Italian cafe (forgot the name), and it was the BEST pasta I've ever had.  It came with a generous thick slice of garlic bread that was toasted to perfection and oozing with garlicky juice with each bite.  Splendid!\n\nFor someone who is very difficult to please, I was surprised at how easily the Wynn won me over."
4651,4,I started tanning at Las Vegas Tan to prepare for my wedding.  The salon is clean & contemporary and has beds that give you great color because they are properly maintained and technologically cutting edge.  I also had a custom spray tan a couple of days before my wedding.  It gave me fantastic color that lasted for a week and did not rub off on my dress.\n\nI would recommend this salon to everyone.\n\nLori

26939,4,"I love West Elm! My go-to stores for kitchen, bartools, and glassware are usually Sur la Table and Crate and Barrel. I'd been in West Elm once before, not noticing they had a home goods area. (Or maybe it wasn't there yet). They have great glasware at a better price than most home goods/ cookware stores. Butcher boards, knives, barware, everything you need (Along with great furniture). And, they're opening up a coffee bar right inside the store! Pretty cool. Shop and pick up a cup of jo!"
28870,3,"Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Rooms were amazing. I would definitely stay here again. They only draw back is there are not a lot of dining option in the hotel itself. The hotel also is set pretty far back from the strip, so venturing out to get food or entertainment can be a bit of hike. Although, it does have very easy access to the Bellagio and the Aria."
3512,0,"Buyer beware: if you're looking for a company for SEO or any other website services, DO NOT use this company! My company signed a contract with Fasturtle with one of our sites ranking (at the time) #1 on Google. Two years and tons of money later, one of our websites has fallen off of Google completely and our other site that was #1  had slipped down to the fifth or sixth page (we were blamed for this, by the way).No proactive actions were taken when the rankings began to slip. We received no warnings when suspicious links were found (by us!) on our websites, and one of my sites was down for two days until I had a customer call and inform me it wasn't working. Fasturtle had the audacity to charge us for fixing the site that went down on their watch! Every single time we had a problem on our websites, we were the ones to locate it. Their \""customer service\"" (that's an oxymoron) is horrendous; turnover at that place is insane which says a lot (I must have dealt with at least three different \""sales reps\"" for our account) and I had countless ignored emails and calls that went unreturned. We have since dropped the disservice of this company and enlisted the services of another company and, despite the mess left by Fasturtle, are on our way back to our former high ranking. Now working with a proficient company, I can see just how incompetent the services of this company really were- I don't know what they did with our money besides let bad links on the sites, not update anything, and ignore our calls. I'm just relieved we don't have to deal with these people anymore, and I strongly caution anyone considering their services to look elsewhere."
33202,0,"I've had decent car washes from this place before.... But the wash I got today was not worth the money. I was in a rush and didn't have the time to thoroughly inspect the wash till i got home. There was still blue soap spots in some areas, the wheel wells were still dirty, and there were random unclean spots on the car. Disappointing. I will not be returning."
48802,0,"I have been contemplating my \""cheat meal\"" all week and wanted none other than Pink Box. Well I was extremely disappointed with not only their selection but their entire set up, decor, ambiance and service. I felt like I walked into a 10x10 closet with an awkwardly unhelpful employee. Besides the lack of aesthetics, there were hardly any specialty donuts! Their selection was dismal and disappointing. I was not going to pay for an over priced glazed donut that I could get anywhere else. I have tried the Fat Elvis donut before and it was amazing. However unavailable at this location along with any of the other specialty donuts I wanted to try. Needless to say I left empty handed. If you plan on being open for extended hours or 24/7 like the other locations than I suggest having something worth choosing from."
36215,3,"When I moved to Fort Mill, I had to say goodbye to some of my favorite cupcake places back home.  I was pleased and relieved to see a specialty cupcake place in the neighborhood.  \n\nCupcrazed has a great variety and some really inventive flavors like Pb&J or Popcorn.\nWhile I sometimes find that not all of the flavors are hits with me, I don't mind the occasional mediocre cupcake because I also have a few favorites --- in particular their Sweet Tea flavor and I think it's a Cafe Mocha (?) flavor.   \n\nI'm such a fan that sometimes my husband surprises me with cupcakes from here instead of the usual flowers.  Yes, he's a keeper."
31115,2,Son said his Mochi was hard. Hubby and I thought this place isn't as good as yogurtland as far as flavors and quality.
31262,1,Coffee is great but they don't have Splenda.  I asked the person behind the counter and they said we have stevia. I explained that stevia least a nasty aftertaste and they said we only carry all natural products. I would say that the pastries that are in your display case beg to differ.
36028,0,"I walked in just now and stood at the counter. The woman who worked at the counter ignored me for about 5 minutes. I said \""hello\"" and she finally made eye contact with me and told me would be with me a minute. After she was done cooking, she continued to ignore me and started cleaning the cafe instead of taking my order. I walked out and went next door to Pho Saigon and ordered some food. I advise that you do the same.\n\nI read a few more reviews and I see that other people have had the same problem with the woman at the counter being rude."
28899,3,"Overall, a great spot. Mostly AYCE but you have the option to order ala carte & can even order 1/2 rolls, which is great for trying new things on a budget. The fish is always eceptionally fresh, & Ive never been disappointed after a visit there, though they are a bit creeative with some of the special rolls....(The Tornado Roll, raw fish & cheddar cheeses? I tried but, IMO, not a great idea.)"
47286,0,Once again yet another failed attempt at living spaces. I was in the location in phoenix to pick up my coffee table and purchase a painting. From the second I walked in the door and not being greeted by the sales manager Xan. Once I walked up to her and asked if the table we order could be pulled so that we could pick up her response was if you scheduled it to picked up it will be ready. I had explain to Xan that I purchased the table online and never scheduled a pick up date. She finally called and had everything set up for me to get it. In the meantime we walked around the store and purchased a $200 painting which when I walked the cashier I had to wait while once again everyone was to busy to help me. The gentlemen who walked in the back were great and got everything loaded. Got my product home after inspecting to make sure nothing looked damaged and go figure it is missing 4 screws. So I called in knowing I wasn't going to get help in hopes they had worked on their customer service since the last time I had to deal with them.   Well to my shock they haven't. The customer service agent told me I could buy the screws else where or wait 2 to 6 weeks for the screws from the manufactor. She said that they could pull one for me to pick up and when I asked for them to deliver it for free because of the issues I have been going through with this company her response was we can't do that. I asked to speak with a manager and she placed me on hold came back and said there is no manager avalible and that one would call me back in 24 hours.  Once I get this product I will never purchase from this company ever again. So your time and shop else where you can actually find their products else where. I would rather pay a little more money and deal with this crappy company. Because of your crappy customer service you lost out on $1000 worth of sales. I will keep updating with the crappy service I receive in this sale.
28671,4,Love this breakfast place! Some of the best breakfast items! You order at the counter and sit wherever available. They definitely need to expand their space and open another location. It's nice they that they cater to vegan and gluten free. Food is excellent -- try anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed.
17680,3,"I have been here twice always craving sushi. Each time the staff would ask puzzled if I wanted any bbq. So, finally I went there to sample the Korean bbq. Now I know why they offered the bbq each time, it was just amazingly delicious!! My friend and I shared short ribs and tenderloin with onions. Sides included were kimchi, potatoes,  bean sprouts, spinach, pickled radish, rice and my favorite fish cakes. It was all phenomenal. I had a lot of questions about all the dishes since this was my first time eating Korean. The servers were knowledgeable about each dish, the ingredients and how they were prepared. Being from NY where you could spent four hours at a table, it was refreshing that the servers didn't give in to Arizona's love of rushing through a meal. It was a great experience, I'll be back for more. Oh, side note, I removed a star because they had no desserts."
28138,1,"Decent food at an affordable price. We came to eat here around 1am on a Friday night when we first arrived in Vegas. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away. I shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because I wasn't too hungry. The steak was OK at best - it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium- but who's complaining for under $4? Hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. Overall everything was lacking in salt; understandable given the older crowd. OK place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery."
14740,2,"Got sent here from Social House at TI... this place is allegedly open for food until midnight and until 2am for drinks on Monday nights, but we got here at 1am and it was muy cerrado. The staff closing up did send us on to legs four and five of our quest for late night Vegas sushi: Hamada and Kaizen.    Would like to come back to RA... it does have a reasonably cool location looking out onto the orgy of marketing that is the Fashion Show Mall pedestrian plaza."
32859,3,Food here was surprisingly better then the Hash House on Sahara. I figured it would be the other way around but the food was actually alot better here.  Service on the other hand was not as good as the one on Sahara so i guess thats the trade off... lol
44005,0,I have a bad experience here first of all I pay a lot of money here and I was supposed to get a root canel and then a crown but they say I didn't need it so now I'm in really pain so I have to come back to get it and pay 690$ which I saw in the websit it say 380$ so I tell Monica she told me that is 380 and up but I didn't see the up in it so becareful don't go there they mislead the price and rude too. I regret to pay over 9000$ for this place . And they rush u in and out too I don't think is. Honest place . The only doctor is nice there is dr Robert but all the other doctor is not good. So I will never come back here again. The other doctor that did my teeth he no longer work there but after I got the vaneer it fell off I didn't think he have experience at all. Next time they shouldn't do false advertisement I'm really disappoint about this place .
25791,3,"Superb cafe right next to Concordia campus that's perfect for a quick lunch, a study area (especially downstairs), a quick delicious drink or a relaxing weekend with poetry readings on Saturday & Sunday. Basically, they have it all! The half panini + soup combo is under $10 which is a steal for a student like myself. The lavender, rosemary lemonade is deliciously tart and full of flavour, which is wonderful because many a-times lemonade is extremely watered down. Yes this may just be another \""artsy\"" cafe that litters montreal, but the atmosphere and table arrangements create a comfortable stay, no matter what you're there for! Also, i read a past review that there used to be shisha and i'd love to see that return! It would be awesome!"
19128,2,"I love the tortillas here, and as everyone else has said, it's very quick, but I was disappointed with the machacha and egg burrito which had very little taste.  Also, the salsa just didn't do much for me.  The enchilada and taco combo I ordered a different time was only ok.  I like the refried beans.  Overall, it's good but not great Mexican food."
34876,3,"Ugh.  So Bloom is owned by Food Lion--except Bloom is the non-ghetto version that was meant to compete with Harris Teeter.  The problem is that some brainiac at the Food Lion corporate office decided that Bloom was no longer to be.  Thus--all Blooms are now Food Lions.  This location has been undergoing the ghettoization to turn it from a pleasant market-style layout to a straight forward aisle by aisle grocery store.  It's almost like they've strategically placed dirt and goop to give it that Food Lion feel.  I'll be shopping at the Harris Teeter up the road from now on.  Sad, because Bloom was such a great palce."
29177,3,"Burgers and wings are good. But I enjoy this place because I love stopping in for a beer/wings after taking my dog on hikes. I like the dog friendly, but have encountered some unfriendly staff. I've seen some totally flat beers they bring out. Absolutely no head and no bubbles. I prefer bottles at this place that way I know what I'm getting. I'll be back, but only because of location and dog friendly."
29203,1,"So disappointed by a place that has such rude front-end service that it's hardly worth getting to a seat where service is hit or miss, with food that is hit or miss. Instead of improving customer service, they've now hung a sign telling people to shut their kids up, and shut up about bad service. \n\nPretty sad. A little courtesy goes a long way toward customer service and good feeling. I remember when they first moved into this town years ago. They are a shadow of their former selves in all ways."
27004,4,Don't believe bad reviews. This place is top notch and beats spending $150 per night on the strip. Get a free 2 night stay on the weekend by buying a package from Ontario mills. 149 and you get all your money back at the resort!
31720,4,"Stopped in for some brisket.  Had the dinner plate.  As usual, cut it with a plastic fork tender.  Just yummy.  I went with double mac and cheese as my 2 sides.  Theirs is a little different.  Has some onion and I suspect other spices in it and I love it.  And as I always do, I must mention the sauce.  Again, a little different than the usual here.  Love it again.\n\nAlso as usual, friendly and prompt service too.  Thanks again Bobbee."
31250,4,"our favorites are the miso soup, mermaid and baked lobster roll! I take my kids here often, we love it!  The atmosphere is nice, the kids enjoy sitting and watching them make the rolls.  The lunch specials are very affordable the customer service is great.  very clean too!"
6161,4,"Fish tacos,  how could you go wrong with these!"
36942,1,"Extremely overrated. I expected much better due to the yelp reviews and the hype, but the food was mediocre. I ordered the kalua pig Benedict (two of my favorite foods combined sounded amazing) and the red velvet pancakes. The best thing about the pancakes was the whipped cream on top them. The pancakes themselves were really bland with odd tasting chocolate pieces and a decent cream cheese syrup. The concept is great and the price isnt bad but they're definitely not worth ordering again. The eggs Benedict were mediocre as well. I could get more flavorful hollandaise from ihop, which is says a lot. The pork wasnt tasty to me but I've had too much perfectly cooked kalua pork to enjoy anything less than. I thought the fried cabbage was a pretty good accent though.\n I'd try different menu items from this place again when it isn't as busy in hopes that it's reputation isn't pure hype but honestly this place is average at best."
6807,4,"Great selection and wide variety with good prices make this my new favorite Asian/international market in Madison! Store and items were clean and fresh. Variety of ethnicities-- I went home with Jamaican, Mexican, Indian, Arab, Thai, and Chinese foods/products in my bags! Near downtown and very close to the beltline make it easy to access, even if you're coming from out of town. Seems like the strip mall and library which share a parking lot with Yue-Wah has all been recently updated. Looks nice."
25071,1,"I wasn't a fan of the place. Not trying to be rude, the bread was stale. When we walked in there was only one other person during the lunch hour. Our order had several mistakes too. I would be hesitant to come back after this."
26615,2,"This review will probably get lost in the 100s that have preceded it, but I feel like my opinion should be known anyway. That's so Yelpy of me. : )\n\nHonestly, it's really not worth it to eat at this restaurant. Great service and pretty good food, but I have had a waaaaay better experience at a churrascaria for way less, I'm talking $26/person for buffet and that restaurant offered snake, alligator, etc. in addition to the normal variety. So, I was not impressed by Texas de Brazil.\n\nFirst of all, their meats weren't very exotic. They had chicken, beef, pork and one lamb variety. They had garlic and bacon-wrapped variations, but that was it. Furthermore, they were \""just okay\"", nothing that made me want to drool.\n\nRice, mashed potatoes, and the bananas were very good side dishes, but you are at this restaurant for the meat, right? My favorite thing was the p\u00e3o de queijo AKA cheesy, soft, delicious, heavenly bread.\n\nWe got free cake. It was our anniversary and my man's birthday just a few days before. That was a nice touch, so I did write a raving review about my waitress on the comment card. But, unless I have a coupon, I won't be coming back here."
14323,1,"Resort is beautiful, and the pools are fun. They should allow guaranteed adjoining rooms for families. When you're paying their rates for two rooms, it is a real inconvenience to have to split up. They supposedly fixed our room assignments twice, but each time it became a bigger disaster. I've stayed here many times in the past, but management and competence have seriously declined in the last two years. I hope they get their act back together and turn the place around, because the resort and amenities are nice!"
5987,3,"I recently did a pizza crawl through squirrel hill with a friend, where we hit every single one of squirrel hill's 7 pizzerias, and got a slice of pepperoni pizza at each one in a row!  Our favorite of all of them?  Mineos!  It's like loading a shotgun full of delicious cheeses and pulling the trigger.  Their pizza is all around good, but it's primarily a righteous cheese delivery system, and a cheese lovers delight!"
34125,3,"Went to Puck's, last minute, for dinner with family. Located in Crystals Mall on the Strip near Aria, it has a bright semi open space, with a nice small bar area. Only had to wait 10 minutes for a Friday night walk-in around 9PM. Staff was adequately attentive.\n\nOverall, food was good. I tried the grilled ribeye steak, which was probably the priciest entree on the menu at $40. But it was cooked perfectly to my order (medium rare) with an unctuous reduction sauce which I wish I had more off. Topped off, it had a nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. (which was a nice touch of heat) to the dish. A perfectly acceptable opening meal night in Vegas. Nothing too fancy or spend, but good food still.\n\nSampled the tiramisu dessert at the end. Tasted really good. It had these nice chocolate beads in the creamy layer that added a surprising little crunch to the dish.\n\nEven though it's a mainly pasta/pizza & some seafood place, I can safely recommend the ribeye here. Enjoy the good eats."
33217,2,"Good for a quick bite to eat. \n\n\nThe food at Tamales Guadalajara has a authentic Mexican fare, with large portions. If you go to Tamales Guadalajara make sure you try the salsa and the guacomole, it's very tasty. \n\nOn my first visit to Tamales Guadalajara my friends and I tried various menu items.   Some of the items we tasted  were the red beef tamales, beef flatas, rice, beans, chips and salsa.  I really enjoyed the beans and salsa. The tamales had a nice taste but they lacked filling. The Guacamole was delicious and their salsa was very good. If I were in this area again I would definitely plan a second visit.\n\n The staff is polite, courteous, and accomdating.  You will not feel rushed though they do a great job of getting your orders out to the table in a reasonable time. So if you are in the area, do yourself a favor and try Tamales Guadalajara, good food, reasonable prices, and great service. You'll be glad you did."
31336,1,"The cupcake choices are ordinary. The prices are expensive. The servings are small.  The only bright side is Sunday. That's when they have their lemon cupcakes. I'm not a lemon person, but that cupcake is good. I never go there any other day, and I seldom go there on Sunday. Not worth driving out of your way for dessert."

The email to us said it would take 24-48 hours to get a confirmation but nothing arrived. We emailed the company after 48 hours and got an email saying it sometimes takes longer. We then called Dig This the day before because still no specific time had been verified. They claimed to have no reservation for us at all and no availability until the following Monday. Of course, we aren't on vacation forever and thus, despite trying to book well in advance now have to accept missing the opportunity altogether at no fault of our own.  No special accommodations were made for errors on their side."

20716,2,"I've had both great and sub-par experiences here so I gave it the middle of the road rating.\n\nThe first time I was here, I was blown away by how different the sushi was and how they had things no other sushi bars seemed to have in Arizona.  The next 3 times I went back, Sunday, Sunday, and Friday back to back, I've been noticing things that I did not notice the first time.\n\nFirst, I would like to say that I believe that a waiter/waitress should not wear cologne/perfume.  I did not notice it the first time I went, but every other time, I noticed the guy bringing the sushi literally bathes in the stuff.  I'm about to eat a bite out of my 10$ per serving of Monkfish liver and catching a big wiff of [insert popular brand of men's cologne here] is not appetizing.  Especially since smell is so heavily associated with taste.  A very big faux pas in my book.\n\nAfter the great experience the first time, a few months later, I went 3 times in a row... back to back Sundays and Friday, I was able to notice that their specials didn't change in that time frame.  The chef's-here's-a-little-something-extra-you-didn't-order was the exact same also.  Maybe it's just me but I know a lot of places change their specials at least once a week.  How is the special still fresh if I see it every time I go?  I know the special is still there because they have not sold it out yet.  You know?\n\nAlso, their tempura is really sub-par in my book.  I know it's pretty hard to not have good shrimp tempura, but it's really blah. I've been able to taste it every single time I went there (it comes out as a side to a lot of noodle dishes such as udon and soba) but it tastes really floury and oily, and it's pretty heavy, batter-wise.  Shrimp tempura should be very light, almost an airy crisp, but not here.  My fellow diners were all in surprised agreement their tempura really was pretty blah.  Also, if you really like the tempura sauce other places have; the warm savory dipping broth other places have with grated daikon radish, don't expect it here.  You gotta use your soy sauce.  :(\n\nTheir cold soba noodles are very salty.  I've had to ask for a glass of ice and literally had to use the entire cup to dilute it enough to tolerate the saltiness.  \n\nThe praises of this place come from the type of sushi you cannot find elsewhere.  I love the saba here, which is Mackerel.  Other places usually take the easy route and marinate it in the pickled ginger juice or their own vinegar marinade, but this place really serves the raw stuff.  Very good.  A must try in my book.  \n\nSometimes Hana has monkfish liver, which is hard to find elsewhere.  It's better than uni (Sea urchin gonads) and literally the foie gras of the sea.  Very similar in texture and taste.  Mmmm... So good!!!\n\nBetter than the average sushi bar, but a couple of things really rubbed me the wrong way and therefore brought my rating down to 3 stars."

But, I feel that I was open minded when entering this store -- they failed the test! \n\nP.S. The only cool thing about the store is their parking garage...It is below the store. I wonder why Walmart hasn't tried that idea...."

Got a suite, at first was like, hmm it is nice, once that glamor wore off, reality set in, there is black mold in the bathroom, hair all over the floor, smells like cat litter, bed bugs, bed bugs, bed bugs!!!!! I called Amex immediately and they are removing the charges, I checked the f**k out and am heading else where. At 158 a night, you don't get what you paid for, I wouldn't even stay here for free!!!! If I could give no stars I would! Oh and don't go in the pool, I learned the hard way, I have a red rash all over my body and just read that it was closed down because it was a health hazard! WTF! If you are hungry, just look under the bed, you'll find some moldy cheese and a bloody tampon! So glad I am out of this sh*t hole! DO NOT STAY HERE, EVEN IF IT IS FREE!"

5203,2,"For those of you who don't live in Vegas, this is the company that picks up your trash and recycled items.  In the 17+ years I've lived here, they only get 3 Stars from me.  Here's why:\n\nPROS\n- They pick up trash on holidays.\n\n- They never miss a scheduled pickup day.\n\n- They will pickup trash up to 6 feet long.\n\nCONS\n- They pick up the recycled items later in the day, which can make the neighborhood messy if it's a windy day.\n\n- They always leave the trash can in the street instead of near the sidewalk.  Sometimes, they leave the trashcan at the neighbor's house next door.\n\n- They sometimes leave some trash in the can.\n\nOverall, it's not bad.....bottom line, there's no other option, so I'll have to live with it!  Thanks @Misti Y for the inspiration to review the trash guys!"
44108,3,"I eat vegetarian about 95% of the time, but when I feel like eating some flesh I have the turkey sandwich from Blackstrap. Super delicious and soooo flavorful. The braised greens and fried macaroni and cheese balls are really good, too! I know it's a BBQ place, and their whole concept is meat, BUT I would really, really, really love if they threw in a couple main vegetarian options."
38942,4,"Lot better than I expected. Love sushi and these guys get a 5, half a star more for exceeding expectations. Fish was fresh, rolls were perfect without 100 pounds of rice. Even though we didn't AYCE it for those that are hungry it's a bargain, do it. Salmon, yellowtail and white tuna sashimi, bomb. I love hand rolls with no rice, chef refused to make my hand rolls with no rice but made them a cut roll instead and he hit it outta da park all, great rich fat rolls with no rice, great job. Those of u that love Philly rolls, try this it's hella worth it, order their Supreme Salmon roll and ask them to add the cream cheese, it's a buck more, but worth it. Next time in LV, would def go back."

When it did not arrive at the estimated time I contacted GrubHub and they contacted the restaurant who advised it would be here in ten more minutes.  When the driver arrived he said \""sorry for the delay but I am the only driver today\"".  The food was all cold and soggy.  It is bad enough that it took so long to arrive but worse to know that my food had been riding around for so long while he made other deliveries."
7700,4,"I have been riding and racing bikes for 35+ years (I'm kinda old). I have been a shop rat since I was about 10 years old racing BMX. From there I moved to Mtb, then road and eventually tri. I really like bikes, but more importantly, I like bike people. It is a great culture (cult), and the center piece of any good cult is a local place of worship - in this case the bike shop, and more specifically DNA.\n\nI have been a regular at DNA since the day it opened. These folks like bikes, and they get bike people - because that are all riders. BMX? Yep. Mtb? Check. Road? Huhuh! Tri? Got it. There are lots of shops that will take your money and give you stuff, but these folks take your money and give you a bike!\n\nThe service guys (we'll call them servants) have been outstanding. I have used them reliably for race tune-ups, fittings and general maintenace for years. They are great. \n\nI am defintely a fan of this little shop, staff is smart and their service is proven. They have a very broad selection of bikes, styles and sizes, so you will definitely find something to straddle :-). And an added bonus is one of the owners mistakenly asked how old my grandchildren are... Only to be told they are actually my own kids. What joksters! I hope.\n\nAsk for Ryan when all else fails when you are stolling the aisles looking for your next sled. He is sorta like the shop dog - he takes the kicks, and gives the love :)"
37031,1,"First off, this place is not a thrift store, as other reviewers have been calling it. Calling it a thrift store entails that the clothes are donated. Trend Traders is a resale shop, and compared with some of the other resale shops nearby, like Buffalo Exchange and Mustang Xchange, it's lacking. The merchandise itself isn't much to my taste--thing some of the trendier, blander items from Forever 21 and H&M--but more than that, the pieces they carry are not worth the prices marked. The brands they carry are cheap with a limited shelf-life when bought new--who knows how long they'll last if you buy them second hand? You can find similar clothes at a real thrift store like Savers or Salvation Army for a fraction of the price, or you can buy them new for a few dollars more and they might last a few more washes. Either would be preferable."
19171,0,"I called in advance to make sure they were in network with Metlife. I was told that they were and gave them all of my insurance information. I was a new patient, and my insurance covers 1 yearly checkup with x-rays and 2 cleanings a year 100% with no copays.  After my cleaning I was informed that I had $115 charge for the cleaning. I asked why and was told that I had a PPO plan (which I knew) and that I could pick anyone I wanted but that they only got paid 80% on \""their status.\""  In other words, they were not in network.  Two weeks later I received a bill for another $57 dollars.  So now they want $172 copay after my insurance already paid several hundred dollars. I had no unusual procedures, just a regular cleaning. The doctor was great, but clearly his administrative staff have no clue what they are doing when it comes to insurance. I could have seen many other doctors without insurance and paid the $79.99 new patient cleaning and x-rays fee, with no insurance and saved money. \n\nI have left a message for the office regarding the additional $57 which I have no intention of paying as $167 dollar copay on a several hundred dollar cleaning (after they billed my insurance) is ridiculous. I am still waiting for a return phone call. \n\nThe doctor and the dental staff were great, don't get me wrong, they just need to hire some people who know who they are in network with and not just roll the dice with new patients."
45021,0,Waited for over an hour for my scheduled appt. Barely any leg rub. My nails lasted half the time than normal. Will never go back.
25566,2,Based on the food it's a 2 star restaurant. Based on the service it's 4 stars. I ordered the guinea fowl. It was extremely dry. The potatoes were undercooked. My wife ordered the fresh fish(red snapper) and the escargot. Nothing to rave home about. Lorenzo was extremely apologetic and offered me another dish.
23043,3,Took the family last night and there was a 20 min wait.  Waiter gave us the specials for the night and provided good service.  The portions are very large so go hungry. The onion straws were tasty and so are the sweet potato fries.  Extensive list of beers.  Prices are reasonable.  It is consistently voted one of the best in Charlotte.
24698,2,The food is always awesome. The time it takes to come out is a little to long some times. Regardless it's a great place to eat and healthy.\n\nEdit: wow the article about their cookie was interesting. To good to be true. :/
24649,0,"Was visiting friends in the area, wanted pizza. When we arrived, we were ignored by who I assume was the owner when we arrived. Waitress seemed disinterested in our happiness with our pizza.

13262,2,"I liked Boa, the atmosphere is nice and the food is solid but I'm not sure I'd race back here again.  No particular reason why... other than it was good but didn't blow me away.   \n\nStandouts were the seafood, particularly the prawn cocktail appetizer... fat fresh giant prawns... only three of them but boy they were delicious.  It's hard to find really top notch prawns that aren't mushy or weird tasting so that impressed me.   The lobster was similarly good, as were the king crab legs, if a little salty.    My filet was well prepared, too...   but I can get good steak at home so... (shrug)...\n\nMashed potatoes were bland... don't bother unless you add extra goodies to them...   but the asparagus was well prepared and I'd be interested to try the goat cheese baklava next time.  Perhaps as a lunchtime treat along with the prawns.  \n\nMy go to cocktail here is definately the strawberry martini with balsamic and cracked pepper.   REALLY nice when strawberries are in season.  Try it."
28835,1,"Located on The Las Vegas Strip. Yes, it's big and shiny, but I am not a particular fan of Aria or City Center in general. I will give a few reasons. The casino is big and cavernous not appealing at all, it is trying to hard to be Los Angeles,and if you have read some of my other reviews, I hate Los Angeles, I hate even more when Las Vegas doesn't feel it has its own identity and style and feels that it has to steal from Los Angeles. Next it is designed like an MC Escher drawing, to get to the convention center you have to up then down then up again, simply shameful. Every other hotel casino on the Las Vegas strip you can walk by with no or very lute incursion, at City Center you have to walk up and down and be taken off the strip. Lastly my take is that they could not care less about Las Vegas community, they never created the jobs they said they would, and they do very little in the way of outreach, nor do they bring in the $$$$ they claimed they would. There are better places to go that are designed more intuitively and are more appreciative of your business. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
13824,4,"LOVED Mystere!  This might actually be my favorite Cirque show.  There was so much action, it was awesome.  Definitely recommended, and not a bad seat in the house!! Actually don't sit in the front row, you want to be toward the middle so that you can see EVERYTHING."
31515,3,"A bowl of rice and a very nice price and and alot of spice is what makes me come here.\n\nI can get a Salmon bowl with brown rice and and a ton of hot spice for less than $7. \n\nWalk in there is a line leading up to the some registers and meny board on the wall, the usual Jap fair chiken teriaki bowls etc, options for all while meat and the like.\n\nI got for the salmon bowl $5.99, a great way to have fish that is not fried at a decent lunch price. I find the teriaki sauce a bit much so I order light on the sauce. for $.25 more you can upgrade to the health factor of brown rice.\n\nGet your bowl and head to the condiment area, there is hot chilli powder, sauce and sliced green onion. I really appreciate the onions.\n\nI think some of the low scores come from the fact japanese food just does not have the flavor punch that Chinese and Thai do."
34316,2,"This location is okay but not as good as the one in Litchfield Park (gets 4 stars). \n\nI live half-way between both of them and depending where my errands are at in Goodyear/Avondale I end up at the two different ones. I have eaten their food at least 20 times:\n\n-Rolled chicken taco special\n-Chile Verde\n-Carnitas (way better at Litchfield)\n-Chorizo burrito\n-Carne Asada Fries\n-Enchiladas\n\n\nIt is my understanding this location on Estrella is run by the son of one of the Partners. He needs to be in his store more! Depending who is on shift, the food quality varies so widely. And the heavy set dude at night on the drive-thru needs to quit if he is so unhappy. \n\nThey need to take notice because the Ramiro's down the street has new management and they have greatly improved and will give this location a run for it's money."
33577,0,"AWFUL!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! DO NOT GO HERE!!! They painted, yes paint, like spray paint, my Hermes purse and a Chanel purse!!! I have been a loyal customer for 7 years.  I didn't want to wait for a professional \""spa treatment\"" for my purses so I figured I could come here for cleaning.  Being a loyal longtime customer I trusted his opinion and advise.  Owner John, said he could restore the color.  No problem.  I came to pick up my purse and was horrified to see it was painted.  When I questioned what was done he was very defensive and angry.  He kept saying it was beautiful to him.  Not listening to me the customer.  Didn't even want to listen to what I had to say.  I realized my best bet was to ask for store credit since I go there all the time.  He argued with me about that!  So I just left.  I will never go there again.  Not because of what happened to my bags, but because of the way he treated me.  After 7 years of loyalty, he couldn't set his pride aside and come to an agreement.  I am so disappointed and bothered by his customer service."
17930,2,"We're always ordering food from here for our lunch meetings and i believe Jason's does an nice, A-OK job.\n\nThis review is for the catering side, since I've never set foot in the restaurant. We normally order two or three trays of food. They usually include two huge two pound bags of chips. Ruffles I believe. \n\nWe also get a mixed twelve case of pop.  Their trays have a mixture of breads (rye, white and whole wheat) and meats (roast beef, turkey breast and ham).   Jason also throws in some napkins, condiments and kosher pickles. \n\nIt's all good, with very little left over. So if you are planning an office meeting, I would consider Jason's Deli."
15186,1,This place was just fine as a third rate Chinese restaurant...but it was not worth the time it took to get seated (5 minutes) or the money (reasonable for Las Vegas casino standards). The noodles were overcooked and the seasoning was bland. Skip this place and go to Lemongrass at Aria. When I want food like this I can go to Panda Express for the same thing.

Then he charged me 10$ extra for putting crackel polish that i supplied. When I questioned why he said it not the product, it the time it took to do it. Really???? It was just one coat of MY polish. I will NEVER go back there again."
43804,2,"I was here with a group for Smunch on Sunday.  Nice thing about a group is you get to try more than one dish.  All of them were OK.  It seemed liked the biggest hit was a scramble with wild game, that week it was boar.  I had a fish cake Benedict, that week the fish was cod.  It was good. Of interest to note: the fish cake was both the protein and the base.  With a group of 8 you would think the food would come out in a 5-10 minute window.  Actually it was more than a 20 minute window.  The waitress was pretty attentive most of the time but a couple of times we had to flag her down.  Two of us drinking coffee had to ask for a refill.\n\nThe beer wall gets it own paragraph.  For good reason.   There are something like 30+ beers on tap plus a few wines on tap.  All of them are listed on the wall with a bit of description and their alcohol content.  Some of them are pretty potent.  You can get a flight of 6 sample glasses for $9, you pick which 6 you want to try by filling out a card, which comes back with the flight so you remember what is in each glass.\n\nI wasn't really impressed with the space.  I liked the look but as many have noted it gets pretty noisy as it fills up."

Tony, the manager, walked up and was gracious and understanding of the situation...he gaves us menus and told us what he liked the best. I wasn't that hungry so I opted for a heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad...my friend got a bone-in Ribeye, truffle mac n' cheese...and also bananas foster for dessert. The service was lovely at the bar (thank you Mario, Bobby and Tony). They were quick light lightning when we had to have our stuff boxed up due to my friend was about to pass out.

32224,1,"Soooooo, there was an online article about Sweet Tea's that caught my attention. I decided to give it a try. First impression? The small waiting area/entrance had items of trash on the floor and newspapers in disarray on a stand. Once I entered the restaurant there were 4-5 employees sitting at a table (meeting?) obviously too busy to clean the entrance area. As I was seated by the hostess I noticed 3 more employees come into the restaurant, none of them bothered to clean the entrance way or pickup the trash. The floor of the restaurant was sticky in some areas and very slippery in other areas. Did I mention an employee's cell phone was near the cash register and kept ringing? (not to mention the ring tone was annoying). The food was mediocore. Terrible cornbread! The restaurant is 'drafty' so bring a sweater/jacket. The shrimp & grits dish is commendable yet I dont think they are 'Charleston' grits. \nLong short, I would not suggest you rush to visit Sweet Tea's....it's not worth it."

32564,1,"I had really wanted to read past the reviews and like this place, but beyond the view, it did not live up to the owner's dream.  Putting their staff in tuxedos was as uncomfortable for me to see as for them to wear.  There was no pedigree in their training, beyond being polite, but polite is not what a tuxedo wears.  \""What can I get you guys...\""  and the minute a plate was near empty, a tuxedo would reach over you and yank it away.  You had to time your eating.\n\nI had an appetizer of escargot, and although generous in the portion, they were tasteless.  It needed seasoning, garlic, oil, butter, and white wine.\nFor dinner, I ordered Cavatappi Shrimp Natural.  Again, generous on the shrimp but tasteless.  It was pasta with shrimp. \n\nMy wife ordered a glass of house chardonnay and could not get past the first sip.  I tasted it and it was , honestly, undrinkable and I love finding cheap French wines. We had to get a $85 dollar William Hill Chardonnay to get through dinner.  Seriously ridiculous (400% markup)  My wife ordered their Hearts of iceberg appetizer with the hot bacon vinaigrette but it was so vinegary it was hard to eat and she could not finish it.  For diner she had the Coq au vin, but again--lack of seasoning.\n\nAll in all, it was so overpriced and under-delivered.  I felt really bad for the young couple at the adjoining table, hopefully they were overwhelmed with the view to make up for the lack of delight in dinner.  \n\nIf this place wants to survive, ditch the tuxedos, lower the prices dramatically and season the food.  The chef needs a pallet for seasoning, or is being held back by the owner.\n\nThe place was not very crowded."
33244,1,"My girl and I are planning a spontaneous trip to Greece so last night, we stopped into Beach Bunny Swimwear to check-out some of their swim wear.  We'd never been there and probably won't go again.  \n\nWe were greeted with a loud voice from the back as we walked in and then after a few seconds, the girl behind the counter also told us that they closed in about 8 minutes, in a brisk way... not very customer friendly.  My friend teased back, telling her that she wouldn't like it if one of her employees had said that so the girl proceeded to tell us about a time she'd stayed until midnight for a client... \""because ya know, they were spending thousands of dollars\"" but she didn't even get a raise for it.  I didn't know how to respond.  I was thinking that she must think we couldn't afford to spend thousands and/or that if her boss gave her a bit more positive reinforcement or reward for staying late, she'd be more friendly.  Either way you look at it, it was a weird story to tell.    Plus, I may be a regular salary girl but my girl friend is about to buy an Aston Martin... with her own money. \n\nAnyway, the swim wear was cute from the window but not functional when we got up close.  They'd be good for photos, I guess.  \n\nWon't see ya there."
8255,1,"We didn't have a very good experience at Razz's. Maybe Razz wasn't having a good night because he was shouting at one of his staff members at one point and was excruciatingly loud then and with some of the guests at the bar. So, point one; if you're looking for quiet intimate dining, skip Razz's....\n\nMore importantly, the food, especially considering the high prices, was disappointing to say the least. My wife had a fish special (Sea Bass) that was overcooked and dry. The contrast of raw accompanying vegtables made for a terrible combination.\nI had the Bouillabaisse ($29). I'm no chef, but have done enough cooking to know that if you heat shrimp in hot sauce for more than 3 minutes, you get little rubber balls. For some reason, Razz and/or his staff doesn't know this. The only reason for the two stars is that the rest of the dish (mussels/clams that are somewhat resistant to overcooking) including the broth was tasty.\n\nIf it weren't for the groupon that mitigated the bill......I'd Really be upset.\n\nI think there are much better experiences for fine dining in the valley...."
42565,1,"The sisig tacos, which I was so excited to try (SINCE WE LACK ANY GOOD FILIPINO FOOD TRUCKS HERE, like they have in Cali)... Well it was soggy, the 5 lbs of onions they used to try to hide the lack of flavor..it was all bad. Not the best first sisig taco experience. What a let down. Maybe ive been spoiled from Cafe Moda's awesome sisig. Whatever. It was just horrible. \nthen the Longanisa fried rice. Tastes like cheap shitty fast food Chinese fried rice with bits of Longanisa. \nThe only thing I enjoyed was the bistek Tagalog. It tasted like homecookin'. \nAnd really though with the iPad? The waitress takes your payment through this, and of course she has to type in what tip you gave her.

11758,0,"We heard a lot about this place and were excited to try it but once we were there we couldn't wait to leave. I don't like very spicy food and everything on the menu had a chili pepper next to the name. There were maybe two items without the chili pepper. We ordered anyway because my boyfriend loves spicy food and we were already seated. My blue corn? tamale was inedible, my rice was a mix of newly cooked and old, dry, hard rice as is they scraped it off an old pan and mixed it in with the new. The carne adovada was nondescript. We left most of our food on our plates and still left with heartburn from the overbearing spice."

19828,1,"As a frequent gambler on  the Vegas Strip, I figured I'd make my way down to Fremont Street to experience the Old Vegas, Classic Vegas, whatever you want to call it, to see the older casinos.\n\nIt was nice to gamble in the casinos and walk around, and maybe I'm just used to the strip and how things are over there, but I prefer the new school look.\n\nI like roulette a lot, and not many tables had the automatic chip counter. It slows the game down, (at least it keeps money in your pockets longer). I am by no means a high roller, so when some bets that I make in the newer casinos are over the limit in the old ones, I know their is some sort of problem.\n\nZiplining. Sounded like a cool idea. But for what the ride actually was to the $20 price, not really worth it. I could say I did it and that's about it.\n\nOverall, it was basically what I Expected. I figured it wouldnt be as impressive or trendy as the strip, and it wasn't. So it should be a 3 star, but the over priced ziplining bumps it down to 2 for me. It wasn't a bad experience, just Meh."
19867,3,"My girlfriend had a 5 day conference at the Mandalay Bay so she booked this hotel.  I got to tag along.  I only stayed Saturday night to Monday morning.  It's a nice little place.  I liked the fact that is was off the strip and quite and comfortable.  The rooms were clean and nice.  An actual internet cable rather that wifi was nice.  Flat screen TV was nice.  There's still places out there with consoles.  Oh hell, I'll be honest.  I'm still rocking a 1990 Sony Trinitron in my bedroom.\n\nI have two complaints.  Our room was next to an exit, but that exit is one way only.  To get back in the room we had to come in through the lobby.  I also tried the breakfast buffet.  It cost $10, no big deal.  But the bacon sucked.  It was like that thin ass, limp microwaved bacon you get at Carl's Jr.  You're charging me more than a Denny's or IHOP, give me some real, meaty, thick ass bacon.  \n\nMy girlfriend only had one complaint.  The shuttle.  She was able to get the shuttle over to Mandalay Bay no problem, but after 8-10 hours at a conference all she wanted to do was get back to the room and relax.  The shuttle was late every day she took it.  She ended up taking a cab back one day and then bitched at the conference and got VIPed and a parking pass."

49218,0,"I was always a fan of the HNJ chain in California, but tonight was just not their night to be representing their chain.\n\nTonight was my brother's 24th birthday and I already called in advance that a group was coming in to dine in. Our waiter, who I will hold the name from this review, took our orders, served us water, and left his shift giving it to another young man who took over the table. Granted, I knew it was about 70 mins from Last Call and we were a big group, you would assume attention to detail is most important.\n\nFirst we order appetizers, which were mediocre at best (the calamari breading was too salty and saturated from the deep fryer oil). Next, the orders of clams came out and within the first two clams I ate, I felt like I almost split my teeth because I bite gritty sediment in my food. Seafood should've been washed properly and rid of the rocks and grits of the clam. I had to send it back. By now, my appetite has faded because of the quality of the food I expected from such a reputable chain. As everyone one around me got their food, multiple bus boys/girls brought food out to the table. Unknowingly more people came to join our party, the late comers who ordered food after my brother and I received their food first. Granted, most of us ordered similar dishes, it should have been the staff's responsibility to figure out who's food went to who. I ended up not getting my 2lbs of shrimp with potatoes and corn, sending back a pound of clams, and not even enjoying my appetizer.\n\nWhen the checks came back, none of the orders were organized in the way we set it with the first waiter to left serving us. I almost feel bad, which is why I'm donating a half star to the review, for the new waiter because he got bombarded with complaints from our table. Beers from one side of the table were charged to the other side of the table's tab, and one of my friends ended up paying $95 when he barely at half a bag of shrimp. It is just ridiculous, and what made it worse is that it was closing time, so pressure to get up and leave was felt. I've worked in the restaurant business and I know how staff get when the last few customers don't leave.\n\nThe only reason why I'm donating another half star to give this review of Tempe's Hot & Juicy a whopping 1 star review, is because he gave us a free pound of shrimp 'on the house' from the kitchen. I honestly don't know what is wrong with this chain but from what I remember at my experience in Cali's HNJ, it was a night and day. I'm leaving this review still upset and disappointed at the professionalism of the staff and food quality tonight."

10839,1,"Since i moved in here near the boca park area, this is the closest pet store that i could get my dog's food. As a dog lover myself, it breaks my heart that everytime i go there, those poor puppies looks sad and sickly, they are stepping on their own poop and seems skin and bones hiding on their fur. I tried not to look and just grab the food/stuff i wanted (which is kinda overpriced!), pay at the counter and leave as soon as possible. The staffs there, which consists mostly bunch of teenagers who have no idea what their doing rather than to asked a generic question \""what kind of dog do you have?\"". They handle the pups poorly and one of them almost dropped the yorkie. Its just so sad that theyre very much engaged in gossiping and chitchatting (and theyre not even shy to tone it down even just a bit)."

25387,1,"Arrrrgh! I do not like Club Parking! Thinking about my experience here puts my nerves on edge. I should clarify that my days of enjoying dance clubs have past, although some of my gay friends still push for me to go to clubs with them. I usually have lots of fun, but Club Parking was TOO MUCH. If there was ever an example of something being an \""assault on the senses\"" this is it! It's one of those places where it's impossible to stick with your friends, even if you hold hands going through the dance floors. The club is packed to insane degrees and there are two huge floors to lose people. Occasionally, I walk into a bar like Parking that's completely not my vibe, which instantly gives me the impression that I'm too sober, which of course leads to too much drinking that I don't notice until I'm stumbling out of the doors at 2am. Anyway, the vibe of this place is fire hazard skin to skin people, more flashing lights than I've accumulatively seen anywhere else, a lot of people on drugs, smoke machines and cage dancers. \n\nSigh, writing this totally makes me sound like an old biddy. A number of my friends enjoy this place, but just as many of my friends hate it. Actually, the friends who like it are all gay guys and the friends who hate it are all girls (gay and straight). I realize it's not for everyone, so see for yourself."

Any company, any model disc or accessories you need are here. They also run a few of our local leagues and do a tremendous job at that. \n\nI couldnt thank keith enough for finding me the best set of beginner discs 3 years ago and now i play roughly everyday and am a tournament player. If you dont disc golf yet or havent in years stop by say hello and get some knowledge about whats going on with disc golf nowadays. \n\nIf i could give 6 stars i would."
49668,4,I always love going to The Capital Grille for great drinks AKA Stoli Doli & great food. This was no exception.What a professional team! I loved the wine pairings & really enjoyed the samples of food. I look forward to trying a sit down dinner w/the generous pour in the coming weeks!
3062,1,"As a regular at The Keg next to Chandler Mall, it pains me to say that my last two visits were less than stellar. When setting up nearby tables, the busboy sent the utensils crashing across the tabletops. Twice in a row, there were families who could not control their children: screaming, doing somersaults in the aisles, etc. And then to order the recommended fish that turned out to be too dry to swallow...I am really disappointed! Where is the management presence?"

25190,0,"This place was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't even bother trying. There was a line wrapped around the lobby of the Mirage, and I figured why not. Big mistake. It's way over priced, the bartenders are horrible, the music is from like 4 years ago, no where to dance, and the B-Team is perched on the stripper poles. Unless you want to people watch, then try somewhere else."
2124,1,"So we got duped by all the rave reviews for this restaurant. First we get escorted to a tiny little table that was practically like sitting with the people at the next table. We asked to sit at the many empty tables for four. Were told no as they all had reservations. The waiter must have noticed the perplexed expression on my face because he came back after we sat and told us that a reservation had cancelled and offered us one of those tables...So points for that...Side note, all those tables were empty for the entire time we were there.\n\nI ordered the Chicken with prosciutto...I promise you that what I got was chicken with some sort of thick slab of very salty pork product that was not prosciutto, accompanied by the limpest over done pasta I've ever had..The noodles broke in the fork because they were so water logged and soggy. Also served with a basic marinara sauce that in no way complimented the lemon wine sauce on the chicken. My husband ordered the special..seafood risotto. Plenty of seafood, but we're still trying to decide if it was really risotto or some undercooked rice..There was none of the creaminess associated with well prepared risotto.\n\nAfter that we decided to go for broke and order the tiramisu..You can get better at your basic supermarket bakery.\n\nThe service was very good as the waiter and busser were very attentive.."
9520,0,"This hotel/casino is off the strip and reeks of smoke. Granted, 9 out of 10 gamblers at the hotel smoke constantly while gambling so hard to control I suppose. They do have a small non-smoking slots area...but no such area for table games like blackjack or craps. As a non-smoker, it's a real turnoff. The food options are ok...nothing like the amazing food you can eat on las vegas blvd strip hotels. The hotel rooms are nice, but nothing special. If you can handle the smoke and are ok with a very average experience, it's a fine place to visit. Not for me I'm afraid."

34836,3,"Overall,  good buffet selection.  Went there on Valentine's day craving for some seafood buffet.  They served complimentary champagne and unlimited lobster claws that night. The line was long but it was  worth the wait.  Asian dishes could be improved, I think."
1895,3,Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.
6192,4,OMG there's only a couple times in your life when everything just clicks. That was tonight.\n\nI got the price fix (a 42$ meal with 3 courses) with a ceased salad that had great dressing and flavor in every bite. Then I got the filet cooked medium rare (#amazing) wich words cannot explain. Then came our souffl\u00e9 wich is inastagram heaven. (#foodporn)
13655,2,Was surprised that the jerk fried rice was not as spicy like the first time I went here. The portions seemed smaller than before and barely filled the round foil container. The food was still tasty and satisfying. I recommend the black beans over the refried since they have more flavor. Service was good and prompt. The staff was friendly and helpful in making our choices. The order paper is a bit confusing and the staff is there to explain to the newbies but it still takes a couple of times of doing the paper before you get the hang of it.
26904,2,"Reliable Chinese delivery at a good price.  Once you learn what they do well (General Tso's chicken, the duck dishes, lo mein, teriyaki chicken, shrimp egg rolls, steamed and fried dumplings) and what they do not-so-well (won ton soup, fried rice, regular egg rolls)*, you can have a pretty consistently good experience with them.  Online ordering makes things a lot easier, the delivery folks are polite and arrive within the estimated time, and the food is pretty good.  Also, one night we ordered a little close to closing time and arrived a few minutes late to pick it up, and they were very nice about sticking around for us.  \n\nI wish I could give it a less lukewarm endorsement, but going from the Asian food of San Francisco, CA to that of Swissvale, PA has been a little bit jarring.  All in all, no major complaints; it's great to have a dependable Saturday-night-in staple for the fiance and I. \n\n*The won ton soup and regular egg rolls are so-so, but passable; the fried rice is just abysmal.  If you want fried rice, go elsewhere."
43129,0,"Lacking in customer service, unhappy employees unable to hide bad attitudes, and minimal service provided to qualify as a mani-pedi.  \n\nPurchased a special on Living Social for my wife. First scheduled appointment was never recorded and she wasted a trip. Second appointment canceled due to broken A/C. Third appointment met with staff lacking in customer service skill, unpleasant personalities, and bad attitude. The special offered full mani-pedi regularly $85 for 53% savings. Service provided was the absolute minimum to qualify in either mani or pedi category. \n\nThey don't deserve repeat business, which is probably why they were on Living Social."
8823,0,"The food was over-priced, the portions were small and really the food was nothing special. The service was just so-so as the server brought our appetizer after our entree was served. My wife ordered a salad without bacon and they goofed that. After they took it back they returned her a salad that was half of what she was previously served and it appeared they just removed a bunch of food from her plate rather than bringing her a new portion. Very disappointing experience as I paid a lot of money only to go home hungry and dissatisfied. I am certainly not going to go back to this restaurant."
12820,0,"The hotel is a little expensive for what you get, I guess it's the location. The marketing staff need to learn better ways to speak to guests, I would NEVER tell a guest in MY hotel the way the hotel runs behind the scenes as far as who gets things comped for them and who isn't worth it! Food is as expected mediocre taste and over priced! I lost over $9000 there not to be a sore looser, but do you think I'm \""worth\"" giving a room to? Will stay there again just because of location, but reluctant to how the \"" hotel and casino\"" are run. You also show a nice clean bathroom in the pictures but you don't show the mold in the bathrooms."
1205,3,"One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.\n\nSo - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.\n\nThe guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.\n\nWe went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.\n\nNext stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)\n\nResults - \n     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.\n          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~\n     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.\n          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~\n     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.\n          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.\n\nSo, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.  I can't help but wonder what our next scientific food research challenge will be!"
47699,3,"Day two of the restaurant being open so all the staff were on their toes.  Tried the Buddy's Salumi & Cheese Board (olives, pickled vegetables, grilled Italian bread, genoa salami, spicy capicola, proscuitto di parma, grana padano, tuscan pecorino, and gorgonzola).  The capicola and proscuitto were the best I've ever had and the gorgonzola was epic - bleu cheese flavor with the texture of brie.  Cheeseburger at an Italian restaurant?  You bet because the Pat Lafrieda Burger (brioche bun, tomato aioli, provolone cheese, tuscan fries) was really tasty.  The tiramisu was the best I've had anywhere.\n\nAsk for a table bordering the outside perimeter windows for great views of The Strip.  Bring your camera to take pictures of the incredible entree cakes Buddy and his team made."
20216,2,"I called to make an appt. for my dog to be groomed and the groomer was very 'short' with me as if I was annoying her by inquiring about an appt.  \nWhen I showed up at the scheduled time, she quickly sent me away saying she doesn't groom certain breeds which was not mentioned on the phone at the time of the appt.  I can see why she works with animals and not people since she is abrupt and unpleasant. The only reason for the 3 star is their self-grooming is convenient and affordable."
44282,4,Manager Jeff Rathjen and co worker jose Tapia we came into the store today for a window was not going down but not also going up so we brought it into this store and the manager took the report and gave it to his worker within 5 10 minutes I was told that the window was now working again so that means I do have an intermittent problem still with this window but the company did not charge me no service fee or no charge I am so appreciated and I will use this service company again and I thank you.
503,3,"I have to agree with Todd W. on this one...this place consistently shows \""winners\""...no joke...it seems like the majority of the movies that are shown here win some type of award! Oscars, Golden Globes etc.\n\nSo, yes, I like this theater because they show great movies and those movies tend to stick around a bit longer in the theater. The inside is nothing to really write home about - it's a bit older, but the location is super convenient to SouthPark and MP/Dilworth. Concessions are standard - expensive, yet always a necessity in my book. You'll likely pay the same prices here as you will at other theaters, but the film selection is really why you'll make the trip. \n\nI know I'll be back to Park Terrace Theaters soon...probably to see some half-indie flick that will be nominated for an Oscar!"
8711,0,"Just a word of advice for people that live in and or visit Arizona. Make sure your \nshorts are either above your knees or that you're wearing pants, because the security guards at the front apparently have this idea that shorts below the knee are simply too long to enter this five star establishment. I didn't realize that this was some division of the Ritz Carlton, perhaps they would have provided me with a pair of pants had there been an issue. Little did they know my shorts were stuffed with ridiculous amounts of money, how unfortunate. Go tuck yourself in, Mr. Security Guard. I'll find somewhere that appreciates a good pair of shorts in the mean time."
40439,1,"I really wanted to like this place, but just can't.  The good:  burgers were above-average and the milkshake very good.\n\nThe bad: fries, onion rings, service, and the price tag for above-mentioned milkshake (ouch!)\n\nFries were mealy and bland.  I couldn't even swallow the onion rings.  For half the price I'll stick with In N Out and Smashburger down the road."
9260,3,I'd give it 3 starts if it weren't for the fact that you can walk around with booze and you can play slots.  Other than that this place is not very special.  I think I'm bitter because I took US Airways.  Never will I ride them again.
13863,1,"my first clubbing experience in vegas.. i guess i was expecting too much because this place sucked!! \n\nwhile we were checking in to the venetian some promoter from tao came up to us and offered to put us on the VIP guestlist with open bar wristbands.. we got there at 10.. and we were supposedly able to just cut the line but that wasnt the case.. however, we only waited in line for a total of 10 minutes so that was okay i guess.. but then i find out that we weren't on the guestlist that had the open bar wristbands.. how many different guestlists do they fucking have?!?! that promoter was such a damn liar!! next time im thinking twice before i believe them... \n\nanyways once inside and upstairs with our tao stamps (what's that about?) we went to go get drinks.. fairly easy because there werent that many people.. YET so four drinks set my friend back 70 bucks.. eek! but i guess everything's just more expensive in vegas.. or maybe its not.. i dont know, i never buy my own drinks.. kekekeke.. so then we went onto the dance floor.. the music was alright.. iono i just wasn't feeling the vibe.. an hour later it was packed!! i seriously couldn't even get on the dance floor.. that made me pissed.. but then i just ended up dancing along the top of the lounge seats..\n\ni gave one star because we got in without having to pay.. even my 2 guy friends.. and another star because there were a lot of cute asian eye candy (which, i have to admit, is more my kind of scene)"
2597,4,"Stopped in for a drink after a long bike ride.  Total dive bar, but patrons and staff were very friendly.  I didnt have a bike lock and the patrons/owner said i could just bring in the bike while I got smashed.  I must have spent about $20 after being there for 2-3 hours.  I think the beers are $2.  Its a cash only bar, but they have an ATM in the front.  I will definitely be heading there again soon."
22922,0,"Needs a new name - now.  \n\nThe Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep \""Pischke's\"" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it \""The Blue Ribbon Cafe\"" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  \n\nThe current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that."
13334,4,"We loved dinner so much here, we came back for the very next meal: breakfast!  Although I liked the dinner far better than the breakfast (predictable, given my vegetarianism and dislike of eggs), I still want to give this five stars.\n\nIt's possible that I was dazzled because I really never eat at restaurants of this quality.  But if you also rarely dine like this, listen in:\n\n-Our server was adorable and fun, while still being respectful and unobtrusive.  Think about it --is there better criteria for a waiter out there?  He was like the perfect background music, and I'd go back for him alone.  I wish I remember his name --a young 30-something Polish guy.  But luckily there are many other reasons to return....\n\n-The cheese course was perfect in its range and selections.  Great accompaniments not only served alongside (honeycomb, the right breads and crackers), but also to the bread and pistachios at the table.\n\n-A wine list that gave just the right info to make good pairing choices.\n\n-I loved my gnocchi, served with winter vegetables in a mild and yet cohesive brown butter sauce.  It was heavy and greasy, and somehow that was a good thing.  A must-try!\n\n-Sides of pommes frites and mac and cheese set the bar for any future fry or mac 'n cheese, who will lose any battles they attempt.\n\n-Salad perfectly herbed and vinegared, worked great with the warm goat cheese.\n\n-The madiera tasting for dessert!!!  I had good madiera in storage before this.  Now nothing compares.  This may be a bad thing in general.  But that night, it was a very, very good thing.  1989 Madiera!!\n\n-I'm not a big breakfast fan, and I don't like meat or eggs.  (Anyone still reading!  haha)  But I can say that the french toast was excellent despite the egginess.  (It's more like a bread pudding, with apples.)  And the cheese danish was the best I've ever had.\n\nI'll not only be back to Bouchon next time I'm in Vegas, but Bouchon in Napa is now on the list for our honeymoon next summer!\n\nAbsolutely worth every single penny (yes, ALL of them).  Go."
41627,1,"This was one of my fave clubs in Vegas b/c they played Hip Hop. I can only take so much EDM. But now, hip hop is no longer here! :( sucks. Was here LDW and was looking forward to the night we planned to go to 1oak because i knew they played hip hop, was SO DISAPPOINTED when I found out they stopped.

It's not the best I've ever had, and yet they charge you as if it is. Maybe the reason I hate this place so damn much is because they're just unnecessarily expensive."
49051,0,"Food was bad but the delivery was unbelieveable. It took forever and the driver had the audacity to tell me he didn't have change for my order. It cost $13 and I had $20. That's a little more than a fifty percent tip for terrible,  cold pizza and long wait time. Never again."
25068,1,"Looking for a late night snack...actual dinner, too.\nLarge place with a few tables and pizza by the slice.\nNot to many pizza by the slices were available.  Was talking with the staff about the pizza slices available.  Staff was very friendly...but not so informative...more later.  Ordered the pepperoni and sausage.   Forgot to ask if it is the sweet sausage or hotter...unfortunately it was really sweet...not the crappppy crumbled crap many Burg places use but this was a very sweet tasting almost like tasting perfume.  What a mistake. \nTook off the sausage but it still had the flavors...Oh Well, better ask next time. \nThe crust seemed to be pretty good.\n \nJust as I took my first bite a delicious looking white pizza came out of the oven.  Now why oh why didn't they tell me that?????"
31328,4,"Came here for lunch yest.  Right from the get-go I liked this place.  It's been awhile since I had to parallel park.  The outside gave a cozy feel to it.  I wouldn't expect it around this side of town, took me by surprise.\n\nWalking in, I was greeted by Una hermosa, Gladys.  The waitress, who i found is the daughter of the owner, suggested I try the Carnitas, since it was her grandma's recipe.  Simply delicious!!! The plate was topped with chicharron, and the pork fell apart with my fork.  Also tried the chocolate cake, which was very thick and rich.  \n\nWould definitely love to come back and try the tamales."
31242,3,"After recently getting my puppy, Lil Porkchop and being new around town, this is probably the only veterinary clinic in Vegas I trust. The first time I came here was when my dog wasn't being himself and was feeling sick so I was scared that maybe he had gotten parvo. Tried to evaluate and diagnose what was wrong with him then eventually he got tested and thank God the results came out negative. Turns out he was just feeling sick from the fluff he chewed up and ate from his bed. We figured that out when Dr. Cantwell was taking a stool sample from him and found a string of fluff from his butt. But I guess that's when I really started to like Dr. Cantwell. She was amazing with him. She's was nice, sincere, and helpful. The staff members are also nice and welcoming. Second time I came here was just a follow up on how he was doing and to get his 12 week shots, and still got the same welcoming warm treatment. I have no problem with her or this clinic. Some of these reviews talk about how all they care about is money which I can totally see that. I feel like every tiny problem I call about my dog, they always want to bring him in and I feel like it's kinda unnecessary. But overall this place isn't bad."
21082,3,Great little neighborhood spot.  Great breakfast and good sandwiches for lunch.  We have been there 20+ times with no issues and good food each time.
16755,3,"Even though this place is a good 20 minute drive from downtown Scottsdale, it's well worth it once you get there.  My wife and I dined there last year while in town for a wedding at the nearby Boulders resort (Excellent btw).  After one trip to Spotted Donkey, we were already planning our next trip back to Scottsdale just to go back.  Well, the golf and spa were other factors but I will travel for good food.  So our next trip was about a month ago and our two visits did not disappoint.\n\nBe sure to try the guacamole.  Although it's $10.50, it's really good.  HINT: order it without one of the ingredients like onions and they will make a fresh batch.  The second time we went, we forgot to order it without onions and it didn't taste as good.  My favorite dish is the pork tenderloin, which is served over a bed of mac and cheeese and green chiles.  It's delicious and large enough for two meals.  \n\nEven if you think it's too far to drive for dinner, the beautiful town of Carefree will give you that Arizona experience you know you want and get you away from the urban feel of Scottsdale."
49726,4,"I searched on Google for a close gun store in hopes of a specific HK in stock. Located by Warm Springs/Durango, this baby is only 3-4 weeks old. \n\nYou get greeted right away and introduced names by the guys behind the counter. Service was upfront and helpful. They have a good variety and stock of ammo including 9mm for defense, fmj, or 1000 round boxes. I eyed the 500 round .22 for myself.  Competitively priced firearms compared to other stores in this side of town.  My boyfriend undoubtedly bought his firearm here and was pretty satisfied.\n\n For a new place, they look prepared. I'm sure I'll be back here with my boyfriend in the near future do business."
17204,1,"It's been about two years since we went to MBFG in Old Town. After we were seated and already ordered the Saganaki, I realized why we hadn't been in such a long time . . . the place is a d-u-m-p!  The only atmosphere that reminds me that we're in a Greek restaurant is the startling cry of \""Opa!\"" when the flaming whatevers are brought out from the kitchen.  \n\nOnce I got past that, I was able to concentrate on the actual food and drink.  Apparently, they are changing the menu and they were out of quite a few of the better known, middle-of-the-road type wines and had only Greek varieties available. Greek wine? Would it taste like ouzo? The water, by the way, does not taste filtered, even with a lemon wedge, it tasted industrial strength.\n\nSaganaki, according to my friend and my husband, was divine. The combination platter was huge, enough for three people with dolmades, spanikopita, koftes, tzaziki, and hummus.  MBFG is one of the few restaurants in the area that put lamb in the dolmades.  Very delicious! The spanikopita was light, fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The koftes was also very flavorful. I am not a fan of their hummus (too sour), nor their tzaziki (too runny).  Their pita was on the hard side and a little too greasy for my taste. Hubby had the pastitsia which he enjoyed . . . a nice hint of nutmeg sealed the deal. My girlfriend had the Greek salad . . . a big disappointment.  It had all the right veggies, but the dressing tasted like Caesar . . . a major faux pas for my girlfriend who is the Greek food diva!\n\nI have been to the Paradise Valley location and the atmosphere is much more spirited and well, it just looks brighter.  The Old Town location is like eating in a cave.  If you can get past that, you can have an enjoyable meal.  I can't speak to the service since it was a very quiet Sunday night and our server was quite attentive . . ."
30973,1,"I have had OnTrac delivery many packages for me from Amazon Prime shipping. But a couple of times already they have delayed the package. The first time they were unable to delivery after I paid the extra 3.99 to have the package delivered the next day. the second time which happen today they're tracking information said \""out for delivery\"" and now it says \""UNDELIVERABLE - OTHER REASONS\"" followed by \""REDELIVER ON NEXT BUSINESS DAY\"". \n\nThe delivery man couldn't even put a legitament reason why my package could not be delivered. I am sure he felt he was running late and decided he would just take care of it the next day. Also the guy that first started to delivery packages to me would never smile even if I smiled at home and said thank you after receiving the package and he would not even say you are welcome. He would just hand me my package with a face as if he hates his job turn around and drive away. OnTrac needs to do a better job at training their delivery men on customer service skills. \n\nOverall they do a good job at delivering but I can't give them no more than two stars because compared to UPS or FedEx they just are not as good."
16177,3,"Everything was excellent. Started with the Buffalo Blast appetizer! Amazing! The pizza and soup,were both good and of course the cheesecake was outstanding. The service was excellent and we waited less than 5 minutes to get in. The only problem I had with it (as seems to be the case with many restaurants in Vegas) is actually finding it."

I came here before with my wife, the customer service was great ...years ago.\nBUT NOW.....\nWhile the manager was over and stopped by, he asked if I had a special request. He said He can make it happen in 4 minutes. 30 mins later nothing, but the took my plate without asking. So it is not all you can eat. I am just really picky, no fat- no red. I wasn't done eating. Texas De Brazil is now far better based solely on customer service."

It was still around thawing season when I went, but many of the animals were stuck inside because it was still too cold to leave them out. \n\nSeeing the chimpanzee exhibit made me kind of sad, though. I only saw one chimp and the environment was NOT natural. It looked like they just put a child's jungle gym in a room with windows for the little guy. The flamingos were also stuck inside a room with some water around it. I wish the indoor exhibits were a little better for the animals, but this IS a free zoo.."
2807,0,"Bottom Line - Rapid Collision Center 1.) Performed work to vehicle without prior approval 2.) Lied about receiving approval from my insurance company for the additional work 3.) Failed to communicate needed information to me in a timely manner 4.) Failed to communicate with adjuster about additional repairs in a timely manner 5.) Poor work done\n\nI brought my vehicle to Rapid Collision Center for repairs from a front-end collision.  They properly had an adjuster from my insurance company come out and approve certain repairs to my vehicle.  While they were preforming the work, they discovered additional repairs would be needed and decided to preform the additional repairs WITHOUT having prior approval from the adjuster.  I hadn't heard from them by the date they originally told me my vehicle would be ready, so I called to find out how things were going.  This is when they told me that they needed to complete more work and would need additional time.  A few more days pass with no communication from them.  I again call them to find out what is taking so long and I am informed that my vehicle has been completely repaired, but they are waiting for the additional work that they had already done to be approved by the insurance company.  I called my adjuster at this point to see how long it would take to get approval.  My adjuster informed me that he hadn't even heard from Rapid Collision Center about any additional needed repairs!!  I called Rapid Collision Center back immediately and they said that they were about to contact him.  A few more days pass and I call again to find out if the repairs have been approved yet, at which point Nate tells me that yes, the insurance company has approved the repairs.  He suggested that I come in and pay for the additional repairs and have my insurance company pay me back instead of them since the repairs had been approved.  This was a LIE!  My insurance company had only approved part of the additional cost, not the total.  I called as soon as I found this out, and they apologized and told me that they would be glad to refund me the difference if my insurance company didn't reimburse me after they submit it to them again.  Well, they submitted it again and again, and they were denied again and again.  I sent a letter requesting the promised refund - no response.  It doesn't rain very often in Arizona, but when the next large rain storm came through water leaked in and completely soaked the passenger side of the vehicle.  At this point there was no way I would go back to Rapid Collision Center to address their poor workmanship.  I found a different repair shop down the street and explained my dilemma to them.  The man took a look at my vehicle, told me what he thought the problem was, and fixed it for me.  He charged me for parts only!  Please, please, please, do not use Rapid Collision Center!  When I was speaking to my adjuster he even told me that this company was one of the worst he has ever had to deal with!"
32263,0,"I've only ever been here once for a buffet lunch, so the al-a-carte menu might be good, but we were ignored by our server, and found the dishes to be greasy, bland, or overwhelmingly spicy.  I love Indian food, and was really hoping this would be better.  I'll keep going all the way to South Kings for Maharani's infinitely superior butter chicken and fresh naan.  \n\nAlso, Naan bread should never never never never never be served in a buffet dish under a heat lamp.  A proper Indian restaurant should have a tandoor (clay oven), and should be cooking it fresh for every table.  It's the easiest thing in the world if you have the right oven.  Their's was soggy and dry at the same time, which is an awful combination.  I doubt I'll be going back.  (I'm a little psychotic about my Naan, but when it's done right it's amazing.)"
18216,2,"While one of the healthier choices in Arizona, I wasn't impressed with their food, nor their service.

The wrap was pretty disappointing for me.\n\nI'll probably go again just to see if something else on the menu will wow me. And if my opinion changes, I will come back & update."
24494,1,"Must've caught Eddie and co on a bad night. Aloof service made more so by our order of mostly small plates...even tho the menu is ideal for such a meal (and it ups the tab). All four plates arrived at the same time, too big for the table!  Just WRONG and so uninspired.  As we emptied and consolidated plates to make room, the empties stacked up and festered for a long time until I took out my camera.  Suddenly a hand appeared in frame and removed them.\n\nSpecifics:\nThe much lauded shrimp/potato/horseradish app is not so great. Way too much crust around a smallish shrimp. Even when I dissected one, it was hard to discern the flavors and textures.\n\nThe Mac n cheese is excellent. Large noodles and great cheese taste and texture... As good as there is in the purist category.\n\nCobb salad, large but unremarkable.\n\nSeafood wontons, okay but unable to tell you what seafood we were eating...pasty that way.\n\nAhi app (poke style), good fish, decent seasoning.\n\nNo reason to return.  But if ur in the nabe, check it out.  Maybe they'll be having a better night"
45400,1,"The food was pretty good and the guacamole was awesome, but my boyfriend and I were not treated very well. I guess it's just Scottsdale, but the waitress asked us incredulously if we wanted a table, seated us, and then didn't speak to us for a good ten minutes. She was nice to everyone else, but she acted like our presence was bothering her. I'm sick of going to restaurants in Scottsdale and being treated like I'm not welcome."

That makes no sense, and makes me think that whoever put the menu together hasn't had a breakfast sandwich. They have a 12oz soda on the menu, I was told it was 16oz and then handed a 12oz cup of soda. When I pointed it out the employee said, \""it says 16 on our thing\"" and shrugged.

23427,2,"It's the Wal-Mart of liquor stores. They close too early to be fully useful. The prices are too high to appeal to the thrifty shopper. The selection is vast and wide, yet there are still items they are missing. It lacks the charm of shopping at specialty stores as well as the employee expertise. I can't really see the point of this place. \n\nIf you're having a party and you need multiple types of alcohol for the various tastes of your guests - go to a grocery store... they usually have a decent enough selection and fair prices and you aren't going to go splurge on exotic alcohol for your asshole friends who aren't even gong to help you clean up the place in the morning. The fact that it's in a College zone makes even less sense. \n\nIf you want to buy some good wine - there are several good wine stores (like AZ Wine for example) around the valley with knowlegable staff to help you out. If you want some obscure beers, Papago Brewery will set you up. There's just no substitute for asking someone who knows the product what something tastes like or what would be good for your special occasion.\n\nAs for pricing, many items we were looking at were priced higher than grocery or convenience store prices... however, I'll have to admit that this place does have some fantastic deals - if you don't mind what you drink, then come here for the sales. The website is currently showing a sale in which you buy one bottle of wine for 5 dollars and get a second for 5 cents. That's value. \n\nObviously people like having a BevMo in town, but I'm not completely sold on it. I'm going to have to revisit it a few more times to see if it can win me over. I want to give this a 2.5, but I'll round up rather than down to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I'll have to admit that it's undeniably convenient having all of those options under one roof... it's a shame they close at 9pm. Lucky for you, their website is open 24/7. Still, Wal-Mart isn't good for anyone and I'm skeptical of this whole BevMo thing. If it takes business away from my favorite spots, I'll be angry... and BevMo... you won't like me when I'm angry."
318,0,I'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible.  This is the worst spot on Walnut St!  I'm not even sure where to start. The bar is small and overpriced. I had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved.  The vegetables weren't even cooked. This is a place no one wants to--or should ever want to go.
30083,1,"I suppose its my fault for 1) expecting waaaaay too much from this place and only because it happens to be located in Aria, the newest hotel on the strip & 2) for being a bit too buzzed and extremely hungry to choose my dish without any real thought of what I was getting here.....\n\nMe, the boyfriend, and his friend had a quick dinner here before hitting the casino floor to win back some or our hard earned money.  The server came by and took our drink orders: 2 jack & cokes (for me and my bf's friend) and a ketel cran (for my bf).  After we, including the server,  all shared a quick laugh about a random thing and sensing that our server was pretty cool, I boldly asked him that our drinks be served super strong.  He chuckled and slyly smiled, and suggested, \""oh you mean a double shot?\"" To which I eagerly replied, \""hell yes.\""  He proceeded to take our orders: I ordered the steak with fries, my bf ordered from the 'build your own pasta,' section and his friend ordered a club sandwich with fries. Our drinks came in no time and our server quickly left. One sip of our drinks indicated not only was there NO double shot, it hardly tasted like there was any liquor in there :( Worse yet, the aftertaste was horrible which led me to believe the small amount of liquor that was being used was just house liquor. \n\nWe set our drinks aside and proceeded to grub on our meals when they were placed in front of us 30 minutes later.  The french fries were goood and I gobbled them up with a side of ranch in no time. My steak was semi warm, leading me to believe it had been sitting out a bit too long after it was cooked (and that's assuming my steak was cooked to order instead of sitting under a heat lamp).  It was a nice sized steak, but the way it was cooked (way too done) and the lack of seasoning didn't do it for me. I finished half of it out of sheer hunger and left the other half on the plate.  My bf loved his pasta which looked good...he basically ordered chicken fettucine with alfredo sauce. While he left to go to the bathroom, I snuck a few forkfuls into my mouth. His friend also liked the fries and said his club sandwich wasn't bad and tasted like any other club sandwich he'd tasted at other places.\n\nThe bill came back higher than what we expected.  After reviewing the charges, we realized our 'cool server' actually charged us each for the double shots in our drinks. *&!@#  Ok slick ass taking advantage of friendly and buzzing customers!!  Had we known that by him suggesting a 'double shot' that we would've actually gotten charged for another drink, I wouldn't have agreed to it.   My bf and his friend were also in disbelief of the charges.  However they didn't want to make an issue out of it, in case it ruined any of our gambling luck at the tables (they're superstitious like that) and paid the bill. They must've been right cuz I came up $200 at a roulette table shortly afterwards :)\n\nSo...in a nutshell I wouldn't willingly come back here again.  The food is mediocre and overpriced (even without the double shots that were charged to our bill).  However, if I happen to come back here (not by choice, but by circumstance) I'd probably order pasta or breakfast items since those are relatively simple."
23163,2,"This is me... This is me NOT on drugs... This is me saying that Guru Palace is just okay.\n\nIt's my fault though. This happens when I'm expecting way too much from a restaurant. Guru Palace has been on my list for some time now, but after they won Best of Phoenix, I had to try them immediately... so I made my way over there to enjoy a weekend lunch.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty gorgeous inside, mixing traditional art with and industrial and contemporary feel; that made me really happy. Everything was very clean and there was a lot of open space; again, I was very happy. The food was what started the decline of that happiness though. \n\nSome of the food was very good, like the Tikka Marsala - it definitely rivals India Oven's recipe and their garlic naan was excellent. But some of the food was seriously meh to me. I had some of the goat and it was extremely fatty (and I've eaten plenty of goat, I'm Middle Eastern), the mint sauce had absolutely no kick and the chicken curry (even though it had bones in it) didn't have that rich flavor that I associate with a great chicken curry. \n\nMy hope is that I missed the dishes that earned this place the Best of Phoenix award, and I look forward to eventually making it back here some day to try those dishes. *Feel free to message me you know what I should try.*"

4004,2,"I keep getting behind on my Yelp reviews and blogging so I have been toying with the idea of having a computer at home for quite some time.  Recently I have been looking at the Best Buy ads and this weekend I finally decided to pull the trigger.  I almost got there on Saturday but ran out of time and found on Sunday the same laptop I intended to get was on a 2 day sale that included a free 3 in 1 printer.  Best Buy has in the past not always honored an internet sale price at their stores.  I could have ordered it online for in store pick up but I wanted to pay cash and I haven't figured out how to do that over the internet.  So I called the toll free number and the woman I talked with didn't know if I could reserve one on line or not so she gave me the store phone number.  Talked with Terence and he started by saying my sku was too long but he typed it in anyway and found it should ring up properly.  He then spent about 10 minutes finding the computer and printer and leaving them for me at customer service.  When I arrived I picked up some other items to go with them and a sales rep answered several of my questions and then I picked up my computer at customer service and payed for all it it right there so I didn't have to go through checkout also.\n\nActually a rather pleasant experience.  Over the years I have been in several Best Buys, this one the most.  Sometimes the service is lacking and sometimes like this time it is great.  They did try to up sell me on a few things but not nearly with as much pressure as they used to.  As the sales guy on the floor went over what this computer does compared to my office computers that are 7 or 8 years old he explained about writable DVDs but forgot to suggest I get some and I didn't catch it either so I will pick some up some where."

31333,1,For starters the service was great but slow. Waitress was very friendly and the executive chef discounted our overall bill because we waited over 45 minutes for our lunch entr\u00e9es.  The pop and lemonade tasted dirty. I sent back a total of three drinks and stuck with water. The chips and salsa were decent. I ordered beef and chicken fajitas. Beef tasted like teriyaki and the chicken was dry. Didn't really enjoy the overall taste of the beef and chicken combo. Most likely won't be going back.
31898,1,"You know, for it being such an upscale restaurant, I expected way better service and food. I'm really disappointed in myself for not reading these reviews before we decided to go, as it would have saved us a lot of money. \n\nFirst off, I don't understand why we are asked to wait fifteen minutes when there are plenty tables that are visibly open for seating. After a half hour passed (mind you, we were the only party waiting), we had to walk back up to the host counter to bring it to their attention that we were still waiting to be seated... apparently the had forgotten about us. The best part? The host was visibly on his cell phone in front of customers-- how is this professional at all? Does he not realize that he is the first person that potential customers see? \n\nFor starters, we ordered the guacamole as the appetizer, which was kept simple and nice, although I don't think I would pay $10 for it again. Their tortilla soup was also a little too brothy for me. For being a type of restaurant with a little mexican/latino \""flavor\"", you would think that a dish like this would taste a little more authentic. I really hoped the food would be all it was priced to be, but $42 for a fillet mignon A LA CARTE? Oh, and lets not forget the $13 truffle mashed potatoes that tasted like they came fresh out of a box. Is it sad to say that I've had better mashed potatoes at a cheap dive bar? Come on! \n\nIts pretty obvious that the restaurant cares more for the presentation of the food rather than the quality. I have had way better food and service for a fraction of what we paid at this restaurant, unfortunately."

A member of our party stated a food allergy, he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well, which took another 34 minutes, and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us, when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again, and I would suggest that you do the same.

Although I do like my Cardiologist (Dr. Hines), I cannot remember a time when I have had to call to make an appointment that I didn't have a problem with the scheduling department. This office is very unfriendly.  The staff act as though they are doing you a favor and that you are putting them out.  \n\nI had to call to make my yearly stress test (for which I had to wait over 6 minutes on hold before I got to speak with a person), she asked for my phone number \""in case we get disconnected\"", she spent the next 4 minutes trying to find an available appointment time and then proceeded to question as to whether I was \""authorized\"" to have this particular test.  After I explained that my doctor had ordered it, she said \""just a minute\"" and put me on hold.  After being on hold for over another 6 minutes, when it seemed she was coming back on the line, I was actually disconnected.  I waited a few minutes to see if she would call me back.  Then I called again, only this time instead of being told to wait the message went to a recording that said they were busy and if I would leave a message with my phone number, someone would get back to me immediately, that was 6 weeks ago and I never received a call back.  \n\nIf you have the time to waste and can deal with the disorganization and lack of good customer service, this is the place for you.  I will emphasize here that I find my doctor very good and have hung in there because I like him.  However, there may come a time when I just can't deal with the front office staff any longer.  They are so busy there, that they seem to not care as to whether they are inconsiderate to a patient because they don't have to work hard to find a replacement."

I noticed more and more hair being left on the \""front\"", plus I had a lot of ingrowns (I thought it was just my skin/hair, but after being waxed elsewhere, it's all cleared up). Even more disappointing was that the \""back\"" was ignored. While unpleasant to acknowledge, that's a big part of what makes a Brazilian a Brazilian! When it was simply not done for a few appointments in a row, I couldn't overlook it. Maybe there was a policy change, a change in her description of the service or a problem with my nether-regions, but I wasn't told about it, so the sudden absence was off-putting."

Nonetheless, my personal sample-giver gladly doled out as many flavors as I wanted. \n\nThere are 16 flavors--all are very tasty!  Reeses, cake batter, banana, white chocolate macadamia nut, snickerdoodle, mango...Some of the most authentic flavors I've had from a froyo joint.  It's also nice to see the serving size and calorie count on each flavor's label.  There are lots of toppings: fresh fruit, cereals, candy, sauces, baked goods...\n\nThe one thing that knocked the rating down a couple stars was the melt factor; the yogurt wasn't really frozen and it was completely melted by the time we got it home.

Checking out the Yelp reviews, we settled on Pho Lan, and the reviews were reliable as usual.\n\nThe place was large and clean. Service was excellent - friendly without being too obtrusive. The Pho broth was delicious - it is the lighter style but delicious and not salty at all. However, it could have been a bit hotter as it was not hot enough to cook the bean sprouts I had stuck in there. I ordered #7 which was the more expensive combination, but there seemed to be just a couple of strips of tripe and tendon. Far too little - even though these are the cheap bits (which I love best). There was barely enough meat to go with all the noodles. \n\nWill be back next year...... and hopefully give them another star."
26498,2,"2.5 stars - Cheap and insanely huge....For $7-8 you can have enough food to tip the scale over a few notches...I recommend sharing \n\nI tend to go for the #33 lunch special with a tostada and cheese enchilada. I preferred La Paz's enchiladas but now they are gone....so these will do. The food is sort of one note- cheesy.. Speaking of cheesy their queso is some of the better I've had (I am not an imitation cheese fan). The guac is just ok - wish they spiced it up a bit more and added more lime. \n\nA co-worker of mine ordered the veggie quesadilla - and honestly it was beyond even what a large plate is and was filled with huge chunks of once frozen veggies - cauliflower, broccoli, green peppers, onions. She said the veggies must have been cooked in a thicker oil (not something like olive oil) - and the flavor was odd. So  if you don't eat meat I think a better option (taste and sadly even calorie-wise) is the cheese enchilada. \n\nThis wouldn't be a place I would go out of my way to go to, but I go as a group work lunch and haven't been  disappointed - not the best,  not the worst....just plain ok..."
34917,0,"This place sucks ASS!!! The food SUCKS and they only got me in the place through misleading advertising a happy hour that they lead you to believe is one thing, you order what you THINK is on HR and then...WAMOOOO!!! HUGE BILL the owner threatens to then call the police on you unless you pay up.......... PASS and save your money for Goldies or Zipps right up and down the street."

47625,3,"Went here while visiting my parents for Christmas.  It is tucked in the corner right next to Paradise Bakery if you have a hard time finding it. \n\nThis is basically Chipotle for pizzas.  They have set salads & build your own salad as well.  My parents chose this option and they really enjoyed their salads, but they are pretty big so they were unable to finish them.\n\nThe line was decent size, but went very quick.  The pizza options were broken down to several categories: sauce, cheese, meat, veggies, and fresh herbs.  They do not charge more for adding any of the options (don't know if you ask for extra portions though).  I suggest that you do not get fresh tomato, it makes the pizza very soggy afterwards.  I made the mistake, don't repeat it!  Other than that, my pizza was delicious!  I also had the Pookie, just love that name!  Don't be surprised, it is a normal sized cookie.  I am so used to huge cookies done this way, but it's only $3 so you cannot expect too much.  \n\nWarning, they do have Pepsi products!  Boo!  They also do have a nice selection of iced teas so that made up for the Pepsi faux pas. \n\nWill I be back?  Definitely, but will not order the fresh tomatoes on my pizza."
5865,3,One helluva view and fantastic jalape\u00f1o crab dip.  Pair it with some ice cold beer and this place is sure to be a hit during the summer time!
25540,1,This grocery store gets 2 stars just for being open 24 hours.  \nI only shop there if it's after midnight (when the other grocery stores in the area have closed). \n\n- overpriced\n- very annoying security 'guys' follow you around the store\n- limited selection
8133,4,"Hands down the best neighborhood Italian restaurant in AZ. The veal, chicken and pasta dishes are all amazing. One of the best salads in town as well. The bar menu is one of the best deals as well, tons of food for not a lot of money. They also pour a great glass of wine."

21118,4,I recently got married in Vegas and requested that all guests and family members stay at the Platinum for the wedding. I called in months in advance and got a great rate for the group. The hotel was absolutely perfect! When we arrived and told them we were there for our wedding we were automatically upgraded to a Princess Suite (at no additional cost). The room was massive! The bath tub was HUGE! The Platinum is a non-gaming/smoking hotel which actually has a nice feel to it. And the fact that you can go straight to your room without having to walk thru a smoky casino was definitely a perk. \n\nThe Platinum has a Spa located on the 4th floor. Me and all of my bridesmaids went there on the morning of the wedding to have our make-up done and they did and excellent job! Danielle did my make-up and she made me feel soo comfortable and helped me to get over my wedding day jitters! I definitely plan to spend more time at the spa on my next visit to Vegas. \n\nThe one down side is that the hotel only has valet parking so there was some delay in picking up the car. But the valet attendants were very pleasant and helpful.
42619,2,"Let me state that this initial review is pretty old (sat as a draft that I forgot to post), but I can't update it yet. Review 1,  2 stars : Poor service. Had to wait 6 minutes or so just for someone to come to the front and take our order. Asked for mayo and ketchup only on the burger and the girl taking our order was a smarta**, stating that if we had been here before we would know that ketchup and mayo was on the table. Of course the whole burger came out wrong because the girl interrupted us when trying to order it with her smarter-than-thou attitude. The second girl I talked to fixed it and was really nice.\nReview 2, 4 stars : We got some food while we were bowling for my little sister's birthday. Service was good. Food was pretty good. Overall, a pleasant experience."
34550,3,"For those of you who aren't familiar with Cafe Rio: It's similar to Chipotle but waaaaaay better!\n\nEvery time I visit Las Vegas, my sis-in-law usually has leftover cater-sized portions of the Pork Barbacoa Salad with the house dressing. During my last visit, we had lunch here and this time I got to try it with their tortillas, which is seriously like crack. Normally I don't like to order salads at fast food places but this is the exception.  \n\nThe portions are pretty big but I can eat this salad in one sitting."
2886,3,"When you're a thyroid and kidney patient, you get the joy of visiting Los Vampires at Sonora Quest rather frequently. Oh no, I'm not afraid of needles. Just sick of catching crap from friends, family and co-workers for walking around looking like an intravenous drug user . . . \n\nI've been both right when the place opens at 7AM, and after work (4PM). You can either walk in, or book an appointment online. Highly recommend just making an appointment, because while you can just show up, prepare for a major wait. Appointments I've made are almost always on time. \n\nSyed is awesome. Never a bruise or a goose egg when my appointments are with him! :)"
10476,3,In a bind to go to CES and couldn't believe I could find a hotel this close to convention center that didn't bankrupt me. Great location and found I didn't even have to drive anywhere. Nice friendly place and cool bar/small restaurant inside it. Looked like they were building something in the courtyard I will have to check out next time I am there.  Coming back in a few months.
43321,4,Great place to have sushi the staff is very helpful. I realy like this place and do not understand why the bad reviews. If you do not like the sushi that is on the revolving belt then you can order from the menu. The food is price right and this is now my favorite place for lunch. They will be having alcohol they just need to apply for their license.
30940,1,"Just got out of work, decided I'd go to Carl's. I order my food and its descent. But what really made me give the place two stars would be the service. It was horrible. Never coming back to this location."
17120,0,"Ordered dim sum for take out. When I arrived, two of three items were unavailable. I asked for two other substitute items. Also unavailable. Why did you even take my order when you are out of what I asked for?!? Next time, save me a trip."
68,1,"Service was okay, at best. I wouldn't go there again.  They quoted me at thousands of dollars of repairs for my car to pass inspection.  I took it somewhere else and had it done for a fraction of the quote."
45376,2,"I heard some great things about this place, so I had high expectations.  I wouldn't say my experience was a \""normal\"" one, since we had a party of 12.  Please, keep that in mind when reading this review. I'm sure if you go with two people it would be completely different.  \n\nOur server was friendly and attentive.  My only gripe was how long it took to get our food, and it wasn't exactly warm when we finally received it.  The flavors were great, though.  My favorite was the Al Pastor.  I also opted for a Chorizo Verde taco, just because I've never seen green Chorizo until last night!  \n\nI think it's pretty cool that you can BYOB liquor and they make margs and mojitos for you.  I personally didn't try one, but the rest of the table said they were awesome.  \n\nOverall, this is a great place for the neighborhood, but I'm just not sure if I'd travel from the northeast side of the city to come back."
31388,4,"I first contacted Liz after another accountant botched my 2008 taxes and got me in seemingly deep trouble with the IRS. Liz went through line by line and corrected the errors, then wrote a clear and thoughtful letter to the IRS explaining the honest mistake. Highly recommended."
11066,4,"Stopped in after reading reviews. I had 1/2 tuna & salad bar. Partner had 1/2 pastrami & salad bar. Both 1/2 sandwiches huge & delicious. Salad bar full of fresh veggies, greens, potato salad, mini muffins. Ice cream too. Had their own brand flatbread crackers that were outstanding. Employee Jason came to table to make sure we were happy, very personable. Hostess Pamela who took our order was top notch, friendly, gave us good suggestions from menu. Even gave me sample of tuna before I ordered. Great place to go"
6544,2,"Comfortably Decent\nBy no means the greatest bar in Madison, but I'd say it's quite a bit better than the handful of other bars within 1-2 blocks of it.\nThe decor is alright, but I'm easily mesmerized by a fish tank. The outdoor patio is large, but therefore quite popular. Menu is okay, but heavy on burgers. My tilapia sandwich was quite satisfactory, though. And I'm always a sucker for waffle fries."
423,3,"one extra star because they are consistent, well priced and chicken tempura and chicken teriyaki are tastey. this is my go to spot when i want something cheap and \""asian\"""
21320,3,"I really enjoy this place. The outside may not be the best for evening business outings, but it is a great place for lunch. The box combos are decently priced for lunch, but I enjoy their sushi more. I do wish the edamame was warm as I received it cold, but everything was good. My friend got the spider roll, looked awesome! \n\nThis place is great for sushi and comes without the side of attitude you get at Kofusion!"

Je pourrais pardonner, mais le menu me d\u00e9\u00e7oit aussi. \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, tout semble bien bon. Mais une fois dans l'assiette, soit \u00e7a manque de go\u00fbt ou sinon, c'est trop assaisonn\u00e9 (lisez sal\u00e9). Et le menu des cocktails?

36598,1,"You now the first time I went to the Griddle, I was semi-pleased. It was the second and third time that got me fed up! For service: I have to say its a 50/50. They're service is very unproductive, they almost have no professionalism and knowledge to what the waitstaff need to say or do. The very first waitress that we had was very pleasant, but the second and third time sucked ass. We had to ask for this and that too many times. The food is also inconsistent, the third time I went I ordered \""Griddle combo or something like that\"". I asked for fruit instead of the house hash for $1. So when it came, it was incorrect and the portion size were so small. Here's an example, house hash, mushrooms,spinach, onions, and chicken. Portions came out in that order and there was literally 4 pieces of chicken that were the size of croutons . Pathetic! For $10.   VERY OVERRATED. Just order pancakes and that's it, otherwise you will be disappointed."
13017,0,"Yes this place may have history and its 24hr operation may help keep it alive but the service just plainly SUCKS!!!! I went there for the first time on a week day around midnight because everything else was closed, no waiting line, not too busy, it took three different servers to take our order and get our food (3 ppl)  about 45 minutes or so later. Oh, the corona beer I ordered took the waitress from the bar 40 mins to come back and let me know she forgot to order it. Hmmm, classy? NOT!! Save your money and go to Dennys instead, they may not have the neon hype and fake trees but their service is waaay better!!"
46752,0,"Do not eat here! I called to report something to the manager over the phone about an employee. When the manager became confrontational, I ended the call. A few minutes later, I got a call back from the manager asking for my name. When I told him I wouldn't give it to him, he said he only needed my number to call me back. If the management is rude and harasses customers that try to contact about legitimate concerns, what does it say about the place. I found out the managers name was Jarred which he refused to tell me by the way."
17314,1,OK If you've never been on a club on the strip before then you'd probably rate this a 5... but if you have? Well.... uh.... BORING!!!!   It was a Friday night when I went and it was boooorrrrring.  Empty.  Lonely.  I guess the only good thing about it being empty is you won't catch the swine flu LOL
48837,4,"I love this place.. I come her almost daily on my lunch break.. Great product, great customer service, and a wealth of knowledge"
5877,4,"Wow, this place is outstanding! We felt a little under dressed, seeing as though it was a Saturday evening and everyone was fairly dressed up, but no one made us feel like we should have dressed more formally. Our waiter was great, he knew EVERYTHING about the dishes on the menu, and recited a specials menu that was so long, I lost track of the many mouthwatering specials that he described in detail. Our drinks were fantastic, and the seafood was heavenly. My party finished off the meal with Irish coffees, and they were so strong (whiskey wise) that he had to warn us as he set them down. My Irish nuts and berries ( a cream chamboard drink) was so strong it made my head spin (in a good way). Very expensive, but very much worth it."
36092,0,"I had a terrible experience. I stood and watched the host take three couples to their tables AFTER we arrived and they didn't have reservations. Once seated, we were promised warm bread from the oven that never materialized. I had a shrimp linguine dish that had only 5 small shrimp and the entire dish was dry. And noone ever came to refill our water or even came by to see if we wanted more water. It was horrible and I will likely not return.  It's too bad because the place came with such high recommendations."
12954,4,"Eating at this restaurant was not just a meal but an experience. The food was awesome. We had the special soup, escargot, and the steak frites. The steaks were perfectly cooked. The service was spectacular. Our server, Michelle was a true professional. She made perfect recommendations and was on the spot with everything. We had the chocolate tart and the bread pudding for dessert. Awesome! Sitting on the patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains was just the icing. We will definitely be back!"
47416,3,"Good group of guys work there, overall real friendly which is rare for the bar scene. Limited drinks on tap but prices are very reasonable. good food, no complaints really. the layout is a little odd, but that does not bother me."
6255,1,"Sadly, we had a really bad experience. Our guacamole had a really strange texture and unpleasant taste and the tacos were hardly even mediocre. The fish tacos had no cabbage, cilantro, or lime, they were pretty lacking in general and were served with wilted green leaf lettuce. The black beans and rice had no flavor. The party at the table next to us had to send their meal back for being uncooked. It was just not a meal I would ever come back for."
3472,0,"Earlier this year, I received a beautiful diamond and ruby bee brooch for my birthday. It is a vintage family piece so it has a lot of sentimental value for me. When studying it, I thought I had felt a few loose diamonds. I decided to take it into Scottsdale Fine Jewelers for repair. I met the owner Scott and informed him that I believed there were some loose diamonds and that I wanted the prongs checked and tighten, if need be. I had every intention of leaving it there for repair. He took the bee into the backroom and then came back out with it surprisingly much faster than I anticipated stating that it was fixed and that there was no charge. Of course I was thrilled that there was not a charge and that I could start wearing it, but I was also very skeptical about the amount of time it took him to check all the prongs. Due to that, I did not wear it that often. \n\nThree months later I was wearing my bee and when I got home I noticed that a diamond was missing. I was heart broken and furious, I took such care to make sure that would not happen! I took the bee to another jeweler and explained what had happened. He studied it and told me that the previous jeweler, Scottsdale Fine Jewelers, had taken a pair of wide pliers and clamped them over the entire piece, the possibility of the prongs being checked individually was slim to none. He also found a prong that had been cracked due to Scottsdale Fine Jewelers 'repair' work. I was incensed at what had happened! A vintage family piece, that I took such care in to make sure it was properly maintained, now needed work it did not need before. \n\nTurns out my skepticism was correct. Why a jeweler would claim a repair was completed when it was not even done to begin with is completely unacceptable. I had thought about taking it back in to Scottsdale Fine Jewelers after the diamond came out, but then decided against it due to the fact that Scott misrepresented his work. Why would I take a chance on him doing so again?\n\nI will never step foot into Scottsdale Fine Jewelers again and will tell others not to do so either. If they can't do a simple repair with full disclosure, how can they be trusted?"
39004,0,We had a group of 13 of us today for a birthday/football get together .. Let me tell you that this place SUCKS \nWe never even made it thru the door and this goon of a door man was looking at us \nGeez dude it's Sunday football and it's Scottsdale\nWe were dressed appropriately . Bottom line is\nThis place SUCKS way better places in Scottsdale\nThen this doucher don't waste your money here
33168,3,Great food!  A little pricey for a broke mook like me to do regularly but yummy!
18686,2,"I love Gyros. \n\nThis place is decently priced and their Baklava is delectable. \n\nIt is an okay place for a gyro. I have never had a problem with customer service, everyone has always been very nice, but then again, I have too. I never give shit to the people who make your food, and I'd say that everyone who has encountered the \""Gyro Nazi\"" was probably being a dick to the poor soul.\n\nAnyways, if you want a decent gyro for a decent cost and don't want to drive a half mile up the road for a better one, then Mr. Gyro is the place to go."
16625,2,"I love Himal Chuli. I wish I loved Dobhan. The space is attractive but not warm and welcoming. The service is lackluster even when there is hardly anyone in there. \nAs for the food, it is uneven. I recently had the Tandoori chicken. It was delicious, moist, and good to look at. The vegetables were equally as tasty and attractive. The accompanying yogurt sauce was excellent. \nI have had lamb a couple of times in the past. The last time I had the tangine it was so salty it was inedible. I spoke to the owner who said the preserved lemon could have caused the problem, he offered no reparation. \nThe vegetarian dishes are overpriced. \nI wish that the owner and staff reflected some commitment and joy about this restaurant that could be a neighborhood gem."
44436,0,"NOT FOR VEGETARIANS, I can say that for sure. We went in and were greeted by polite but somewhat immature waitstaff saying that we were the coolest couple that had came in there loud enough so everyone could here. Then we asked our waitress which Vegetarian entree she would recommend since they did actually have a vegetarian section. She mentioned she was a vegetarian when she started but then really struggled to actually recommend anything. This should have been a sign but I Though maybe she just had communication problems and gave it the benefit of the doubt. We ordered two dishes one was a cilantro Chilli entre and one was a mixed veggie and both were flavorless and terrible mostly consisting of Bok Choi which was under cooked and unchewable. One of the entres went back immediately because it was cold. Pretty disapointing considering we dont get out much and this was supposed to be a treat for us. \nThe ambiance was terrible! Apparently they have Karaoke rooms upstairs that you can rent for $32 an hour (WHAT?!) in traditional Korean style. The sounds of flat off key singers coming accross terrible sound systems boomed through the building. Not only that but there was a table where all the restaurants office supplies were sitting out, like tape scissors, stapler and such. This was the right in the center front of the restaurant where your eye normally is focused on. I dont want to see your messy desk area, its unprofessional! The table we were sitting at had a split in it which came apart as we were leaving dumping my water all over me.\n\nI cant say that the meat entres arent good because I didnt try them but the ambiance issues and annoying staff are reason enough not to waste your money expecially considering there are so many great restaurants in Madison."
27812,1,"Came here for lunch.  I ordered the ceviche and what I received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp.  I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \""cooked\"" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions."

24503,3,We like to go here for Tapas happy hour!  Fun little plates of deliciousness that are great for sharing.\n\nIt's a good family place and our picky eater can always order pizza (there's a kid's menu).  \n\nService is usually pretty good.
37315,1,"Came here for a team lunch based on some Yelp reviews, however, the meal I experience was below average.  There wasn't much spices and most dishes tasted bland.  I had to order additional plates of hot sauce, lemon, salt and pepper just to season the food.  Perhaps, it was an off day for them, but I probably wouldn't make additional effort to go back."
23521,3,"The staff here is always extremely friends, burgers are very tasty and their milkshakes are to die for .... rewind to the scene in Pulp Fiction where Uma Thurman asks for a $5 milkshake.  There is no bourbon but these are some fine damn milkshakes!"
37856,3,"Since Yelp orders things by original date, and there are 2982 reviews when I write this, I'm thinking my review will be read in say, March of 2017.  \n\nThat said, I've made a point to try most of the Strip buffets, the other reviewers aren't lying it's pretty tasty here overall.\n\nThey've got the small pots/baskets for a lot of the dishes like some of the other buffets do, and though they are cute, you end up with one on your plate, and no room for any of the other tasty treats.   \n\nAll the usual seafood choices (crab legs, etc...)\n\nThe bone marrow is good, but wow it's filling and greasy.  Do not have it first!  \n\nDessert choice is great, a lot of choices (macarons even!) to be had.\n\nService is normal for buffets, the servers are attentive and friendly, clearing your multiple plates away without you noticing.\n\nOut of the way to get to in the hotel though, which is both a good and bad thing.  Good in that it reduces lines.  Bad in that you have a long hike to get there, and honestly, it feels like you're walking through dead parts of a convention hotel where you probably shouldn't even be.  But viola, there you suddenly are, and it's food coma time."
17185,3,"Definitely a little corny but it was a lot of fun! You have to remember it's not exactly like the TV version. My friends and I had a lot of fun even though we didn't get called up. The famous showcase round was by far the most ridiculous \""set up\"" ever. \nA cruise to Mexico\nA trip to Hawaii\n100 shares in stocks\n2012 Nissan.....the 1st person said $29,675, 2nd person said $33,000\n\nwait for it..............$14,000!!!! come on!! That's not even fair! Of course everyone would over bid if they value all those items for that price!"
15920,3,"Classic MAC and CHEESE pizza!! There is no way you can miss this being in Wisconsin, where cheese is king ~~ The other pizzas they make are good too, but I just can't say enough about their mac and cheese pizza. One day when I leave town, this will be one of the classics that I will certainly miss, no doubt. \n\nI love how Ian's has their pizza is a slice or as a whole. So if you find yourself craving pizza and you can't find 10 other people to share with you, or if your friends have very distinct preferences for pizza toppings, you can just each get your own slice and still hang out together."

We were a party of eight, 4 adults and 4 kids.  We were greeted by their friendly staff and seated quickly.  We ordered the Nacho's and onion rings.  The onion rings were good but I thought the nachos could have used more BBQ meat and cheese.  They were okay.  I ordered the pulled pork platter.  It was good, but not a Wow!  My husband and son ordered the build your own.  My husband and son liked what they ordered.  My grandkids liked the smiley face fries and shark tank.  All in all the BBQ was good, but I have had better.  As far as the service it was good.  My husband ordered a beer and it took awhile.  The prices were consistent with other bbq restaurants.    Overall it was a good experience and we would come again."
2146,1,"I'm giving this two stars only because our server was great.  We went for happy hour and perhaps that was the problem...the spicy tuna roll wasn't spicy and tasted like they made it yesterday.  The tuna tataki didn't taste fresh and was rather bland.  We tried the inferno roll, but i could barely taste it through all the mayo.  On a positive note, the Godzilla tails were pretty tasty.  Sorry Shogun, you can do better!"
18833,2,Employees are really loud and very rude while in break. Is there a reason why 3 of them are yelling and laughing hysterically and manage to be louder then all 20 ppl sitting and eating in the dining room?

Yes, yes, I know I don't have to wear 5 inch heels, but c'mon, at every other club I would've be able to last the night, but goodness....after entering through those stairs, my feet gave up after 20 minutes.   Then I had to trek all the way down the same stairs to exit the club.  I don't know if there was another exit/entrance, but the bouncer told me that was the only way out.  FML.\n\nOther than that, the club itself was very nice.  The patio area was gorgeous and a nice break from the crowded dance floor.  My friends played craps outside and won, so that was exciting as well.  Music was good and drinks were expensive (but it's vegas). \n\nI would go back, but I might have to take some flip-flops with me."
19345,0,"I have a gut feeling I may be updating this review as I am still in possession of my Ford Focus rental from Dollar at the Phoenix Airport. I don't have the final bill yet, and fear I may join the growing list of Yelpers who were overcharged,  gouged, dinged, or otherwise have gotten a haircut as a result of Dollar's alleged business practices. \n\nMy preliminary review focuses on Dollar's customer service, or lack of it, in the wee hours of 29 January, 2014. It's 12:30 am and a group of ten tired, somewhat surly, travelers have queued up to pick up their reserved cars.\n\nI've heard in the line that since the customer service counters at Hertz, Avis, Thrifty, Enterprise, National, Fox, and Alamo were closed, their customers (who didn't belong to their frequent renter clubs) had to pick up their cars at Dollar. \n\nMany flights were arriving late into PHX due to the snowstorm dubbed \""Leon\"".\n\nTen customers, not all actual Dollar customers, were waiting in line to be served by one female employee, who clearly appeared as if she didn't want to be there. \n\nIt was taking her 10 minutes, on average,  to process each customer. I was sixth in line. There were eight computer terminals at the counter. One employee. \n\nThe Dollar Lady, as she will heretofore be known, would call out for someone named Alexis, (unforgettable because it sounded like she was ordering \""a Lexus\"" every time she picked up her two way radio) requesting a count on how many compact cars were available in the lot. It seemed as if Alexis was actually manufacturing these compact cars the Dollar Lady was ordering on the radio.\n\nWhen it was my turn to approach the Dollar Lady, she went through her spiel about insurance, which I declined, as my credit card and auto insurance at home covers me on hired or rented vehicles. We'll see if I get charged for the insurance,  as other Yelpers were.\n\nShe asked if I would be \""more comfortable\"" in a larger car. I don't know the reason for her question.  Was it a lame attempt to upsell me, or a veiled jab at my larger than average body type? \n\nIt's now 1:30 in the morning. I'm tired. I'm surly from waiting 60 minutes in line. I gave her my response:\n\n\""Only if it will get me out of here quicker.\""\n\nI guess my response could have been deemed as \""poking the bear\"". But I said what I said in a straight,  matter of fact tone. No yelling, no snottiness.  \n\nShe said something to me, I can't recall her exact words, owing to the time of day and my reflection upon what I said to her. I recalled her saying \""working here\"" and \""bathroom\"", but the rest was a bit of a blur. She instructed me to check boxes on the electronic contract screen. As I commenced to doing so, she got up and left. \n\nHad I offended her? The tension in the line of people behind me, now numbering at around a dozen, was palpable. Did she quit? Was she going to bring in more people?  Was she going to the lot to yell at Alexis? \n\nNope. Bathroom break.\n\nThe rest of the encounter between me and Dollar Lady was straightforward and civil in tone. I answered with \""yes\"" or \""no\"", bade her a pleasant evening, and headed down to the garage to see if Alexis had my car ready. \n\nI showed Alexis my contract. Alexis pointed towards the Focus. I got in and headed for the exit. Alexis was there again, in the booth. I handed him my contract and driver's license. He handed them back, opened the gates, and off I went...into the Phoenix night. Alexis went back, presumably to acquire more compact cars.\n\nWe'll see what happens when I'm handed the bill at the end of my rental agreement.\n\nOh, I'll be prepared, turning in the gas receipt \""from a station located within 10 miles of the rental location\"", as per the Dollar Lady's instructions.\n\nDon't mess with the Dollar Lady.  Especially at 1:00 in the morning."
35617,1,"This place is pretty pricey. I had a reg strawberry smoothie and it costs an extra 40 cents to get boba. A large was over $4. The taste was ok but it was made sloppy, kinda watery. Had better from hawaii. My moms durian was good though, but I don't like the inconsistency. All products should be made equally well. Workers are friendly enough.  Don't think is worth the hype."
3326,2,"I wasn't sure what to expect with all the bad reviews that I read about this place. But after staying here for 3 nights, it looks like things have improved. \n\nThe whole place underwent renovation about 3 weeks ago. My room was spacious, clean, and fairly quiet. There is construction going on next door that you can hear inside but the noise wasn't loud enough to wake me up. Soap, shampoo, and clean towels were all provided. The free WiFi worked well. The location and price are hard to beat. Search online for coupon codes.\n\nMy only complaint is that my nonsmoking room (the entire hotel is nonsmoking now) still smelled of smoke."
33358,0,Not to happy we need a good Chinese food place out here. Maybe that's what it is. If you go you will feel like you wasted your money after you eat.  I guess it is what it is.  I hope we get some Asians out here to open up some businesses in some of these empty spaces that are all over. We need good food out here!!!!!
41716,2,"I can't believe that I came to a pizza place and I didn't order any pizza! My friend and I shared an order of the not your mamma's garlic bread. I loved the pesto spread and the roasted glove of garlic. I had a garden salad which was filled with all the regular ingredients- tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, etc. It was almost big enough to be shared. I am a part time vegan so I was excited to see all the options on the menu. \nService was friendly. There were plenty of seats for an intimate time or a big group of friends. TVs at the bar to keep you up to date on scores. There is a To Go section as well."
6221,1,The food here is great - my problem with the place is around two things:  ok although a minor problem it still is a consistent problem...every time I go I get a milkshake and every time it is not mixed well enough.  This results in huge chunks of ice cream you have to mash or wait for it to melt.  I dont like that.  The second problem I have with this place is the service.  I have gone four times at varying times of the day and always the service is subpar.  I end of flagging down the waiter for refills and begging for the check again and again.  But the food is good so if you are only interested in the food and the cute atmosphere then this is your place...not for me though.
39423,2,"I learned a lesson here...don't get a burger from a pizza joint. Bland tasteless patty of pale meat....not good tasting or looking.\n\nPizza was decent but something about the oil they use on their crust...tasted a little off for some reason. Could have been just me, others at our table seemed to think it was fine.\n\nChicken fingers were great, big planks for chicken, not over cooked, seasoned well.\n\nMeatball sub was also equally as tasty. So, except for the mystery meat burger, it's not too bad. Staff were super nice and that gets them an extra star."
32903,0,"Ok, so a year later, I came back with the hope that the beer selection had improved.  After all, the trend is for restaurants and bars to improve craft beer selection.  I'm disappointed.  No craft beer on tap, and a couple of generic craft beers in the bottle. \n\nI can't imagine it would take much to get a variety of real craft beer ... several IPAs, some witbiers/hefe selections, and perhaps some stouts and porters. It would be an easy way to attract the beer aficionados with the money and interest to come in and have some quality beer. The food is GREAT, it's just that the beer selection SUCKS. Probably the last time I come into this place ... bummer."
18862,2,"Regular run of the mill place.  Sufficient enough for the co-eds that run this street.  Was surprised that they didn't offer any taco or enchilada dinners, everything was just a la carte.  Drink special were reasonable.  Staff courteous.  \n\nI have nothing against homeless people, but the parking lot is crawling with beggers.  If you aren't happy with your meal, feed them!"
32651,1,"have tried the food here a few times (old location and current) and am just not impressed and it's clear that they have lot of Brookline locals doing their p.r. / promotions for them. People that don't get out of the yinzery confines of Brookline much, i'm guessing.  I see a couple praising reviews of it and I wish I could agree and wish i'd had whatever food they did but , shrug, just another old school / old-boy Pittsburgh Italian-ish eatery. (real Italian is better .)"
39598,3,"Great for breakfast plates!\nThe reviews on this place aren't the best but I still enjoy it and if there's a long wait you can seat yourself right at the bar which has no wait time at all. It's actually a fun spot to chat with the bartenders who are always great and just enjoy your food. \nBreakfast is always great here with perfectly crispy bacon, hash browns, fresh eggs and toast that comes with whipped butter and a selection of jellies. I prefer strawberry & lay it on :)\nThe actual restaurant is very pretty with lots of nice details & yes it's always busy especially in the evenings. I always say that's a good sign. The service is good and I wouldn't say they are the fastest so don't come here if you're in a rush. I prefer to enjoy myself & take my time...\nOverall it's a great place with a good traditional menu and the prices aren't too bad. I come here all the time to grab breakfast for dinner."

44503,0,"Very bad experience tonight and I won't be back. Have been here before and loved the good and experience however tonight was terrible. \nWe sat down at 6p and made reservation on open table. Took server 5 minutes to greet us. By that time we were irritated because it was way too long of a wait. No apologies just why can I get you to drinK. Really? No upsell or suggestive sell? \nWe ordered all of our apps and drinks and then had to flag down the waiter to order our meal. Truly felt as if we were not important. A party of seven with a bill of $350 clearly isn't trying to be cheap but yet we were not taken care of and had to ask for bread, drinks and refills on n/a beverages. \nThe two managers walked around the room quite a bit and never once did they stop to ask about our experience. Really poor table touching.  When I flagged down a manger and told him of out experience he just said okay and never once apologized.  Just goes to show you how much value they out into guest service. \n\nWe won't be back and I will tell everyone I can if this experience."
19314,0,"Run away. \n\nEvery sleazy stereotype of a car sales can be found at this location. Lies, manipulation, deception, and fast talking b.s. are all on the menu and served fresh daily. \n\nWalked away, nay ... ran, and never looked back."
4914,1,"Oh man so I know everyone just loves this place. \n\nWell I have been here a couple of times and usually go for the beef bowls. \n\n\nSo this time around, we decided to get more of their specialty stuff. \n\nSo we got lots of different things the pork and onions skewers, beef tongue skewers, buttered clams, hamachi sashimi, beef carpaccio, miso cod, salmon Kama. \n\n\nThe skewers were ok not as good as kyaras but ok. The clams were ok as well but a little too salty to my liking. Hamachi sashimi was good. The beef carpaccio was too oily. Miso cod was such a disappointment it was mushy very salty and just lacked the sweet flavor you usually get at other places. The salmon Kama was also salty and didn't seem cooked right.\n\nSurprisingly compared to other reviews I actually thought the service was great. They very attentive \n\nSorry maybe we went on an off night"
25631,1,"Average. OK winelist, food basic Italian without much thought, ambience OK. Would I recommend it? Not if I could walk somewhere closer...."
18906,4,The kids enjoyed it. My brother told me they have a deal on Friday - $5 per person. The staff was nice and the location was clean. They have free wireless so I was able to work while the kids played. There are two sides to this location. The side on the left has black lights. If you're out of shape you may want to think twice about climbing the bouncy slide. It is a tad bit of a workout for parents with littles. Overall good experience I would return. Oh the positive side is they have a pump it up screen to take pictures with. I love those things.
13743,2,"The Buffet at the Bellagio, an array of incredible fancy looking cuisine, that dissapoints with bland flavors however, not everything is bad for great service and selection this is a bargain....also, if u have a weak stomach don't plan on swimming after you eat  because you'll be spending a night with the SHARTS!"
2662,0,Love the organ...  Sad to see this Arizona historical treasure in such danger of mediocrity due to poor management.  The pizza we had wasn't worth taking home.  I didn't want to insult the cardboard box by putting pizza in it that is more tasteless than  itself.  Fix yer food folks!!!
26700,3,"I wanted to give their coffee a shout out.  I received two cups of coffee today from a student of mine unexpectedly.  Once was Creme Brulee and the other was Sugar N Spice.  He said to try one or both and spread the love about them.  I gave the other cup to my co-worker and they enjoyed it!  I don't live in that part of town, but thought this was the least I could do.  I'm a big supporter of buying local and spending local.  Tasty coffee with a twist! Hopefully one day I will be in that part of town and will drop by!"
41978,3,"Food was great and give you plenty to eat. Menu on wall didn't have a lot of selection. If there was another menu I was never offered one so not sure if there is more to offer. Food came out quick so didn't have to wait long. Would  come back here again, just hope  there is more of a variety."
28418,1,I don't have too much to say about Tropicana. The place was clean and the parking was convenient. And that's about it. \nThe pool staff was as unhelpful and cocky as can be. The prices in the restaurants and ships in Tropicana are beyond a joke. Should you run out of sun tan lotion at the pool be prepared to pay $17+ for a replacement at the Tropicana. \nAsked for a smoke free room.  Apparently they thought I said smoke full because that's what I got. \nEven if they fix all that crap you still have to deal with the fact that you are at the end of the strip and have to walk a mile to get to he center of the strip. Pay a little more and stay somewhere closer to the center so you don't have to go so far to get everywhere you want to go.
21722,2,"This place is \""okay\"" for vegas (DOESN'T compare to Thai food in LA).  This so-called Thai restaurant seats about 20 people.  Their menu is actually a mix between Chinese and Thai food.  \n\nIt was really disappointing to open the menu and see things like Orange Chicken on the menu.  Really?  Really?!  They don't even have basic Thai appetizers such as angel wings or fish patties.  We were actually debating to leave the place without ordering because it did not have a lot of Thai dishes, but the employees were too nice so I decided to stay.\n\nWe ordered two dishes (because there really wasn't anything else on the menu that sounded Thai, nor appetizing) -- Boat Noodle Soup and Chicken Basil.  The noodle soup had a good flavor, but they did DUMB IT DOWN BIG TIME for vegas locals.  They did NOT have the pork rinds, blood, lliver, and tripe that a boat noodle soup usually has.  The broth was really sweet too, which was overpowering until I added my own chili flakes to balance the flavors.  \n\nThe chicken basil was ok tasting, but wasn't great.  The place definitely dumbed down the spice factor too -- considering we requested \""medium\"" for both dishes, the dishes were NOT spicy at all.  Again, I think this place is catering towards a clientele that can't handle much spicy food nor distinguish between Chinese and Thai food. \n\nMy bf pointed out their water is filtered, which is a good thing, and that they \""flavor\"" their water with slices of lemons and oranges in the water pitcher.  Just fyi for those picky water drinkers out there.  This also tells me that their soups, most likely, have a better taste because the water is filtered.\n\nI would only come here again when I'm craving (semi) Asian food in Vegas and  cause it's cheap -- for two dishes it was only $14."
1613,3,"OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok, like weekly. Filiberto's carnitas tacos. That's all I've ever had from here. Always drive thru. God forbid any of my foodie friends from yelp or chowhound see me. Two perfect little corn tortillas, filled with tender and juicy pork with a few crispy edges, cilantro and pico de gallo. Ole. I eat them in my car. With a measure of guilt and shame. But it just it makes it more exhilirating. And tastey. Ahhhh...a weight has been lifted!"
10959,3,Those Athens fries are the REAL DEAL. I would just come here to eat fries actually and wouldn't have a problem with it. --So I HIGHLY recommend coming here. Oh and also they have hookah right next door if you're interested ;) Why not?\n\nI had a nice safe choice--a gyro. Great tasting lamb meat and not overdone with the mixture of spices and sauce. (I'm also noting that the last time I had a gyro it was a crappy food truck one in SF) so Yes. It's legit here.
8057,1,The hostess didn't ask us where we wanted to sit and forgot to set our table. Our waitress was very good but seemed to be too busy. They need better management to train their people to work as a team. The host staff should have been helping in other areas. Other than that the food was good but it would have been nice to get some warm complimentary bread. I had to ask multiple times for the bread and when we did finally get some it was cold and slightly stale.
25743,1,"\""Tourist trap\"" pretty much sums up this restaurant with mediocre food, service and atmosphere. I don't mind paying more money for quality, but things were far from exceptional. A 12oz beer was $10, and steak and fries was $30. The girls were nice to look at, but nothing more."
39308,4,"China Star is one of the best places to get authentic Szechuan cuisine in the entire city of Pittsburgh.  Great recipes, a broad menu, and consistent execution make China Star an outing that I always look forward to.  The Chengdu Chicken and Cumin Lamb are especially good.\n\nIf you want Americanized Chinese food (your egg rolls and your General Tso's chicken), this probably gets bumped down to 3 stars at best.  But if you want REAL Chinese food, I can't think of another option that comes close."
27269,2,"Its a great little bar, the bar staff are extremely knowledgeable about cocktails and can even mix you something not on the menu. The food is really good and very reasonable for the area.\n\nWhy did they have to build this place so close too the student accommodation? Fanny central."
48469,3,"I like the Sands properties since their shows are constantly rotating, bringing something new. The people who produced the Beijing Olympic ceremonies also produced Panda ! So the basic story is Long Long is on a journey to save his Peacock Princess from the Demon Vulture who kidnapped her on their wedding day. \n\nIt's got a little bit of everything: stunts like balancing on stilts, acrobatics, kung fu board breaking and sword work and traditional Chinese dances from the long sleeve dance to some fan dancing. I think the costuming was done very nicely and the stage was nicely used. The one thing is the whole back wall is used to project various landscapes and since there are steps and such in the back in certain angles the projection didn't look like it lined up right. The musical score I think was welldone and made sense with the story, though it would have been lovely to see more live music since Chinese culture has such awesome traditional drumming and unique instruments like the huqin Overall though it was lively and pretty show. \n\nThey try to interact and make it fun for the audience. Before the show you can find the pandas wandering around the lobby for pictures. During the show, they've thrown out various trinkets, pulled little kids to dance in the aisles with them, throw streamers onto some people, had big panda beach balls being thrown about during a staging transition. Between the theme, the bright staging and the audience interaction I would say this would be a good family friendly show choice. It seemed like there was a high number of children watching and seemed to really be enjoying themselves. \n\nNow I know that the main draw IS the panda characters, but I feel mixed about that. So the pandas are the only ones in full on fuzzy animal suits and other animals are more people with wardrobe that was made to interpret a animal. So there were moments where it's supposed to be sad or tense and I just couldn't muster up the feels for him since the panda was such a caricature of himself. He's supposed to be shaking in sadness and crying when he lost princess peccock, but his big head is just bobbing in a way that was funny and not helping the cause. In the picture I posted of the show, you'll see how it's a serious scene with everyone else on stage and then....there's a kawaii little panda in a suit and top hat. \n\nAnd of course, the story line sounds a little stolen from Kung Fu Panda. I absolutely loved Po, but the animation and the fact everyone else is animated made that more congruous. I'm sure it's a love/hate thing and some people may absolutely adore the fact it's a panda and part of the point is that it's fun/funny. \n\nOverall, I still enjoyed the show and appreciated the variety and a different culture it brings to the Vegas show lineup. Definitely if you are a parent, this would make a great family night. Or if you are a rice chaser, as I saw a lot of those there too."
47080,2,Hail ceasar was relatively boring.. Dressing was bland. Baby kale salad was really good. Turkey burger was okay... Don't get the gluten free bread! Drinks were good.
23538,0,"First time @ this Paradise Bakery location & it will be my last! It was not busy me & my sister were the first ones to stand in line. After we placed our order & paid then the crowd started to roll in. Ridiculously slow service just to make 2 sandwiches. I mean come on REALLY!!! Our order was finally finished until the employee started to pick up trash off the ground before handing me our food! What ever happened to good costumer service??? My sandwich was not even good, dry with no spread & they messed up my sisters order. Horrible service & work ethic."
6942,3,"I have taken my 4 cats to this hospital and never had any problems/ issues. \nThe staff is always friendly, caring and patient. From the front desk to the vet- everyone truly cares for my animals. The vet takes time to explain whats going on with my pet and discuss the treatment options. We've done surgeries at this hospital on two of the strays and the care was wonderful! I was worried all day and the staff let me go back and check on the kittens to ease my anxiety as they were recovering from surgery. \nA couple of times we've had emergencies and they were able to fit us in right away. The only reason I'm not giving a \""five star\"".. is the cost. I don't have the insurance, we pay as we go, and it gets to be a bit pricey-meds, tests.  I would totally recommend this hospital."
42450,0,"Awful!!!! Phil, the associate who cleaned my carpets told me he would have to take my large area rugs outside to wash them.... It was raining. I never had a company have to remove large area rugs to clean them so I decided to have him do the upstairs instead. When I went upstairs a few hours later, when my carpets were \""dry enough for me to walk on\"", I noticed my brand new white sapphire earrings were gone. Phil ignored my calls all night and morning and finally answered me via text message. After hours of going back and forth via text with the \""owner\"", who by the way IS Phil pretending to be someone else, they admitted to taking the jewelry and retuned it on my front porch. Crazy, I know. I have a police report number and let half off depot and groupon know of this issue. Do not use them. If they stole from me, right off my bathroom counter, what else could they have taken?! Buyer beware!!!!"
11479,1,"I went to a party at Sedona over the weekend. It was a cute place I liked the decor. We order a lot of appetizers off the happy hour menu. The Tuna Ceviche was very water, flavorless with little tuna and the chips looked like some sort of sea urchin that were bland and too light to be considered a chip. The Cured Wings were good. Not spicy like promised but the feta on top was a nice touch. I don't like when places try to get all fancy and throw in words like Confit or Cured to church it up. It's fried chicken wings people not French cuisine. The Calamari was nothing to write home about and the dipping sauce was just so so and super skimpy. The Roasted Red Beet salad was the worst I've ever had. The beets were sliced very thin and put on the bottom of the plate then the salad in top. The beet was like a fruit rollup but mushy and you could barely taste it. The salad was flavorless and I didn't detect any dressing. The Shrimp Cocktail was a joke. It was $8 on happy hour menu which makes it $2 a shrimp. I couldn't imagine paying $11 for this on the regular menu. For dinner I ordered the Short Ribs which were really good but for $24 the portion size was laughable. The Salmon was pretty on the plate but flavorless even with the sauce. The Ahi Filet looked like pork and that was also flavorless. Last but not least the Lobster Rolls were dinky as all get out. It was cold lobster salad on toasted bread which was also flavorless. I will never return that is for sure!"
30701,3,The Rigatoni Bolognese is amazing! It's my favorite dish is in this place. (Meant to post in 2012. Way delayed post.)
44683,1,"As a Vegas local, I can honestly say this place takes the lame cake. This is Rum Jungle with a new name. Nothing more, nothing less. Where were all the \""Cirque\"" arial dancers swinging from cool silks and where was the awesome laser lighting as promoted? It sure wasn't  happening the night I was there. (1 wk ago) \n\nInstead, we walked into a almost full, two story nightclub, many girls walking around with their shoes in their hands and when I ordered ONE Vodka Redbull and ONE Malibu Pineapple; was given a $45 tab! Seriously? You guys are not XS or Tryst. Relax.\n\nFor this kind of atmosphere, just go to Oracle Mansion, better music, same quality people and better drinks from what I hear.\n\nP.S. The \""just go to Oracle instead\"" comment is a sarcastic joke!"
13569,2,"Went here with some friends and was not familiar with the menu.  The order counter seemed confusing to me too. Got a turkey sandwich,  but think they used miracle whip not mayo.  Not a fan though."
8313,1,Apparently when you pay $185 to play the golf course it's too difficult to blow the grass clippings off the fairways. I don't mean to sound like an elitist prick I'm far from it. But when you've been living in Scottsdale for close to a decade and play a course the first time with that price tag on it you expect close to perfection. Greens were slow and course was overall in mediocre shape. I understand everyone is going thru or just ending their overseed process but to charge what they do in the condition it's in is a joke. For the price I would much rather play We-ko-pa or troon north if I'm spending the money.
25379,4,Unbelievable atmosphere. The restaurant decor is like a modern art exhibit. The bathroom is downright scary...it's like a kill-room from a horror film...and this is supposed to be complimentary. \n\nAs for the food...I got the classic Eggs Benedict and it was amazing. Great portion. The garlic potatoes are the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. \n\nIf you find yourself in Montreal you have to get over here.
3892,4,"When I think of this salon, I think clean, friendly and overall great!  I have been seeing Sylvia (esthetician) for a couple of years.  She is fast, efficient, friendly and knowledgeable.  I get my waxing done here and I recommend Sylvia to every one of my friends and family.  Call in advanced to get an appointment set and then they have a discount if you book for the next time in advanced.  There is a yelp check in deal for brazilian wax that is to die for... just sayin"
10636,4,"SOOOOOOOOO  consistently great!  From super courteous, friendly, timely service to the hot fresh sourdough bread.... Spinning salad is always very good, although probably could go a touch lighter on the dressing.   Cutting to the chase... the mashed potatoes that come standard are excellent... fresh/smooth/tasty beef gravy.  But really, u GOTTA get the creamed corn.  Would recommend ordering that in a side dish as it's a larger portion which also makes it easier to share with one other.  Plus, the au jus won't run into it so much as it does on the plate.  We also shared a baked potato as it was excellent.  \n\nBut what good is anything if the prime rib isn't 5 star.  Have prime rib everywhere, including the HOP'er (House of Prime Rib in SF), and you just can ever go wrong here.  So consistently flavorful and tender from the outside of the roast on in.  I hate it when the only flavor is on the outer crust and the inside is just so bland.  Also, very helpful that the au jus is so flavorful as well but really, the beef is where it should be.  The Lawry's cut is seemingly plenty even for a big eater, but if you are super hungry, then go for the biggest cut.  For ladies, the California cut is also a very satisfying amount, especially with the appropriate sides.  \n\nDidn't have time for dessert, but i tell you what... Consistently awesome.  We were in/out in 60 minutes, which isn't for every occasion.  But if running off to a show/quick date night with sitter at home, it's great.  So, it's not exactly a slooooooow, course out and take 2 hours super special event meal.  \n\nAlways a win!  How awesome is that in Vegas right?"
47946,1,"I think people usually associate 2 stars with hatred and I don't hate this place but, \""Meh. I've experienced better,\"" just about sums it up. I'm also comparing my experience with Scripps in San Diego which was simply amazing. At Agave, the people are pleasant, if often disorganized and one of the N.P.s I've met has been just great. \n\nMost of the work appears to be done by CNAs and while pleasant enough they mispronounce my child's name every time we visit. The \""triage line\"" is a joke and results in a call back within a day by an assistant essentially saying to make an appointment. At least that was my experience: I was concerned about apparent side-effects from vaccines that were administered a few days prior. I can't afford so many appointments to the same \""doctor\"" when what I'm expecting is a little follow-up from prior appointments.\n\nBut here is my biggest problem with this office, and to me it's huge: Apparently our doctor is Dr. Thomas, but in 4 appointments in 6 months we've never met her. In fact, I've never seen a doctor there during our visits. The entire place appears staffed with N.P.s, P.A.s and CNAs.\n\nThe office is cute, everyone is nice, wait-times can be excessive and based on my experience there isn't an actual doctor to be found. I've received the same level of expertise from WebMD or MayoClinic.com"

20562,0,Don't depend on groupon to get a good deal. I literally compared this place to its competition by there reviews and from what I read first baby imaging was the best. \n\nWell I called to make an appointment 5 weeks ago and whoever I spoke with did not give me enough information to save me a 30min drive. \n\nI told the lady that I wanted to find out the gender before my doctor told me since I would have to wait till 20 weeks. My appointment was for today which I am currently 16weeks. Once I arrive the sign in form has a box stating a $25 fee would be added to my charge if this was my first ultrasound. It also says that they are not a medical clinic and the information they would provide me is everything a doctor would tell me. So why would I pay you $25 if your information is not valid and why wouldn't someone notify me when I made this appointment 5 weeks ago of this extra charge.\n\nNot only did this sudden news make me upset but I was told to arrive 15min early for me to wait at the front desk for 10min to check in. I also requested the first appointment of the day and there were two groups before me. \n\nI will never return to this facility due to how unprofessional it is run and I even informed them on this review. \n\nThis is my first child and I was really looking forward to finding out the gender early but I guess I will have to wait 4 more weeks till a real doctor can give me accurate information.
23742,4,"As always, awesome. A great In-N-Out location, perfect food for a great price. It's busy as you might think an In-N-Out might be in Vegas. Really busy. Did I say it was busy? But it's worth the ten minute wait inside. I think drive through might be faster, it depends."

33459,1,"They still have a lot of kinks to work out.\n\nWhen we first arrived no one was there to open the \""front\"" doors.\nI had to phone the front desk for several issues and got incorrect information each time.\nThe staff at the pools and casino were very unfriendly.\nIf you are staying on a Friday or Sat night you should request the East Towers. For the money I paid I would not expect to be woken up from the partying that was taken place on the roof top bar. It was so loud it shook my tv."
42223,2,"It's difficult to base a review on a single item, so the rating may not be a true reflection of the quality or variety offered at this venue.  I tried the chocolate eclair which was certainly nontraditional in appearance. The top layer was a smooth, dark chocolate,  and the eclair was light (albeit a tad dry). It felt like the experience ended much too quickly, but it was an enjoyable one nonetheless. On a side note, the bakery appears to go by a different name and not the one listed above."
36160,1,"It's okay but only went because that's where the other people I was with wanted to go.  The food is very average, nothing too special.  There are some things on the menu that you think might be good then you get them and are not impressed.\n\nOne cool thing about this place is that they have a rooftop deck now.  So if you are just going for drinks and it is a nice day out, that could be a good option."

I have 2 kids my daughter I gave birth to in NY and I also had a great doctor there but he really knows what he's doing. I was iffy about him at first, I was really thinking about changing to a different doctor but I'm real glad I didn't. If u want a good doctor to deliver your baby he's the one! I had no problems"
13000,3,"I know there is another review for this place, but i'm pretty sure this is the correct name for tthe lounge/restaurant. went here couple weeks ago when me and the guys went to vegas for a 21st bday bash. it was 2am and my friends and i were pooped and wanted a place where we can go and chill. i remembered watching the vegas episode of \""no reservations\"" with anthony bourdain a while back. they came to peppermill for some cocktail in a huge bowl. i knew i wanted one. \n\nbefore entering the lounge you must remember the dress code: no hats. other than that your good to go. it was dark but the neon lights and black lights brought a relaxing mood to this place. it was me and 3 other guys. bad idea. this place is for COUPLES! if your not there with a significant other, you'll feel a little awkward. the plush couches were made for snuggling. we felt really uncomfortable and so we headed straight to the bar. i saw those huge goblets and i told the waitress i wanted whatever drink goes inside those. the cocktail was the scorpion. i had it before at trader vic's. its a very good fruity/girly cocktail. i really couldn't taste/feel the alcohol....yet. its 18 dollars for the cocktail but it can easily be shared by 3-4 people. some guy next to us won 7000 dollar jackpot in video poker, and i'm not too sure the management was too happy with that. overall, this place is a really chill, relaxed place to hang out after a long hard night of gambling, drinking, clubbing/dancing. but make sure you come with a significant other or else get ready to feel lonely and awkward. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSECRET....order the scorpion blended with ice cream. it will freakin rock your world. o and be careful please cuz you won't be tasting any alcohol in it.....it'll taste like a fruit milkshake. :)"

2061,0,"I was referred by a friend and have had nothing but trouble with this office.  In November I found out I was pregnant and was having issues before my first appt; I had an emergency and had to get in right away and ended up seeing another doc.  I won't give names, but that doctor basically beat around the bush to tell me I was miscarrying instead of telling me flat out.  My husband literally played 20 questions with that doc to get a simple answer.  It was ridiculous.  Also in Novemeber I had the office call me on two different ocassions to reschedule because they made a \""scheduling error\"".  As far as I'm concerned thats something they should fix since people take time off to make appts in the first place.  Fast forward to today, another emergncy appt and I just got a phone call from them that they canceled my appt. I am so furious with the way that they run this office.  Try and make your schedule work, don't cancel people.  I'm livid and would not return here if you paid me to!"
22627,4,"Yesterday I had the MOST amazing meal at Mastro's. \n\nI had the most incredibly delicious, juicy, sumptuous double pork chop perfectly cooked--medium well and butterflied.   It was a sight to behold (I should have taken a picture of it to post for you) and the smell, well,  there should be such a thing as smell-a-vision.  I have never, ever, ever, ever had a more delicious pork chop.  EVER. ANYWHERE.   If you eat pork, don't even think of going to Mastro's and not trying the pork chop.  Oh, and did I forget to tell you about the accompanying dipping sauce with walnuts, apple and what tasted like bourbon?  A perfect match to the pork chop and really good.  \nHubby had Chilean Sea Bass which he described as perfectly cooked and delicious. But my not being a fish eater I could not verify that.  I can verify that he cleaned his plate.  We had broccoli florets which tasted somewhat garlicky and hubby loved---I could take them or leave them.  I did notice that the broccoli had some yellow spots on them which should not be for a restaurant of this quality.  I also noted that the salad had tomatoes with the tops on them (the spot which attaches it to the vine was not removed).  This should not be either --Mastro's is too good for that.  We ended with the fudge cake which was good but not as good as the chocolate sin cake that we had before. But still, it was good.  \nWe noted that Mastro's was packed on a Tuesday night.  I think this is a testament to people appreciating the quality of the food and of course, the service.  \n\nThank you for an extraordinarily enjoyable meal.  I look forward to another great meal at Mastro's real soon."

37626,4,"One of the greatest dining experiences I've had all year, maybe all life.\nBurger was succulent, excellent roll, each bite was juicy and delicious.\nThe Oreo Milkshake had some amazing aftertastes, and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one.  I went into a food coma afterwards for about 1/2 a day.  We ate at 4 p.m., and I was done for the rest of the day!\n\nHighly, highly recommended."
29957,2,"My oh my oh my - what do I give Peepshow?  I have thought and thought about this and if I could give half stars I would give it 2.5 stars, but since I can't I will bump it up to 3 stars.  My debate on the rating is as much about how Planet Hollywood runs the show as the show itself.  So here I go. \n\nThe Good:  The show is fun.  It is a loud, crazy, high energy hour that gets the audience going.  Also, I really like the lobby - I know silly - but the corset on the ceiling and the peepholes everywhere really work! \n\nThe Bad:  \n\n1) Holly Madison - OMG I didn't expect an Oscar worthy performance but the girl can barely get a line out.  She ran into at least 2 dancers.  She looks like a deer in headlights!  Terrible!  Except for showing her rack she is one totally out of her league.  \n\n2)  The Showroom itself.  The seats are too narrow and the ushers insist on cutting off access to upper seats and making everyone go up the same way which is just crazy!  Not to mention they don't actually show anyone to their seats and let me tell you this audience needed help.  I have never seen so many people who couldn't find their seats!  And ushers did nothing!  \n\n3) The Showtime & Their Policies on Seating:  Donny Clay does a show at 7p every night and Peepshow does a 9p show every night.  Now let me ask you - does that sound like enough time to clear, clean and seat between shows.  IT ISN'T.   Note to Planet Hollywood, move the fucking showtime you idiots.  It results in everyone cramming into the doors with 10 minutes before showtime and scrambling to find their seats (and I already bitched about the ushers and the seats).  \n\nThen there is the fact that they don't close the doors.  They allow people to get up and come and go as they please during the show.  So during an 1:15h show we had at least 10 people get up countless time to refill drinks.  Translation we never had a clear view of the stage w/o someone's drunk ass not blocking it.  Plus the heckling was OUT OF CONTROL.  You couldn't hear the show half the time with drunk off their ass men hooting and hollering like they were at a strip club.  Yuck.  And the ushers do nothing.  They are 110% useless.  \n\nThe show:  The show might be good if you could hear it over the audience.  There are spots in it that are particularly fun (the emerald bikini pole dancer & the whole pink number).  However, the distraction of the audience and the lack of any skill by the main attraction (Holly), make this show a bit of a joke.  \n\nIt is truly a 2.5 Star show.  It passes the time, but it isn't a great show.  I agree with Diwata P.  If you want an awesome burlesque show go to the Crazy Horse - you won't be disappointed!"
4557,2,"This place is small, located in the strip mall on Craig, next to the Pets Mart. After picking up some doggy items my boyfriend and I stopped here to grab some sandwiches to go on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nI went in to order while my boyfriend kept our four-legged friend busy outside where they have some tables set up for out-door eating. Um, too bad it stinks outside right around the area of the store though. Definitely not appetizing to eat sandwiches around a sewer-like smell.\n\nI have given Capriotti's a 5-Star Review before, but this was kind of \""meh\"". I'm bumping it up to 3-Stars though because the Bobbie was yummy per usual. Unlike a lot of people, I'm not a regular at Capriotti's because I'm more of a Port of Subs girl for my go-to sandwich. However, Capriotti's hits the spot sometimes.\n\nThis location is tiny by the way and there's not much seating to speak of inside. Also, the set up to pay/get your sandwich/get your drinks is a little clumsy to say the least."
6259,1,"I have been into Dynasty for a pedicure before and it was a nice experience. Nothing that blew me away, but nice none-the-less. Unfortunately, I made the decision to stop there to get my nails done yesterday and my fingers are still regretting that choice. The nail tech that I had was rough, made me bleed twice without any compassion and just gave me an overall negative feeling. I seemed to be an inconvenience for him. The work was sloppy and not what I am used to. Now, I know getting nails can cause your fingers to be sore, but I've never had my nail beds hurt like they do today. I learned my lesson not to go here again for a nail set. Just wanted you to know my experience."
30216,4,"Grumble grumble, this place shutdown! Grrrrrrrrr. Not surprising though, the M resort has already passed financial hands to someone else and is no longer owned by the Marnell family. Just as well, some of the people running this establishment had more business running a truck stop gas station than a hotel/casino. Maybe when the M gets it's act together and stops thinking on such a corporate level of ignorance, they can turn things around. They have a beautiful casino and some pretty great restaurants in there along with some great views of the pool from some of them. If they get their management under control (so typical of the Vegas casino landscape) they might have a better chance at greatness.\n\nSo long Veloce."
40507,1,"Found a great dress, but when I was trying it on, the fitting room attendant opened the door on me (without knocking) and I had to slam it shut.

I can't give more than 3 stars though b/c I have had better and a couple other places and I gave them 4 and 5 stars.\n\nChill Out is a small little shop that we stopped in after lunch next door at The Nile Cafe.  I tried to go another time but it was closed so I was happy that I got to try it out this time!  The whole little shopping/dining strip is a pleasant suprise and really cute. \n\nI tried a few of the flavors, cookies and cream and bananas foster-- both were really yum."

So try to go there before dinner peak hour.\nPlanet Hollywood for Dinner --Great food, fresh crab legs. Better than Paris. \nFlamingo for Lunch -as bad as Rio.  Stay away\n\nI would only go back to Planet, Paris, & Harrahs for the buffet pass deal."

45000,4,"I was extremely satisfied with my waxing services from Nadjege. She was thorough, practiced clean techniques including no double dipping and she was amazing at removing in-growns. Her home is beautiful, clean and very private; I felt very safe and comfortable there. Her prices are ridiculously affordable, especially for the quality of service she provides. Also, I was so relaxed I could barely stay awake and nearly fell totally asleep during waxing - that has never happened before! I have already made my next appointment with her."
11955,1,"Well, I guess I'll be the first to give a not-so-great review. \n\nI so love Hubert Keller from all the cooking shows (and actually, I rode in an elevator at Mandalay with him- but couldn't get the nerve up to say anything! DOH!). I had high expectations, and felt so let down.\n\nWe sat at the bar, as the booths and tables were all full. The service was friendly. We ordered the strawberry mojitos to start. They were not good. They tasted like cherry 7-UP and the strawberries were so big they clogged the straw- so you couldn't get a sip without scooting your straw around and trying to dislodge the strawberry. \n\nWe ordered the mix of 3 fried things and 5 sauces to share, and I ordered the veggie burger. I found it a bit daunting to choose from all the little extras for the burger. I did try a couple, and, in the end, my veggie burger ended up costing around 15 bucks (with no fries...those we had to pay extra for).\n\nWe chose the mozz sticks, sweet potato fries, and regular french fries for our combo. For sauces, we chose the spicy ketchup, the tartar sauce, the cinnamon sauce, the chipotle aioli....and I can't remember the other one. They weren't horrible, but none of them were special. Again, it's Hubert Keller's restaurant, so I figured the sauces would be sublime. The fries were also so disappointing! Just basic, frozen fries. The sweet potato fries were great with the cinnamon sauce, and I usually don't care for sweet anything. They were the highlight.\n\nMy veggie burger sucked. For one, it was huge. Hotel rooms in Vegas typically don't have microwaves, so there is no way to reheat left-overs. I don't understand why Vegas restaurants serve such ridiculous portions when you cannot enjoy left-overs! More than half of my veggie burger was thrown away.\n\nThe burger was also mushy and tasteless. I ordered some of the cool sounding add-ons, but couldn't taste them at all. The beet relish came in a little ramekin and had no flavor whatsoever. \n\nMy sister and her friend liked their meat burgers, so maybe it's just the veggie burger. If I ever try the place again, I'll try the vegan sandwich (with the roasted veggies) on ciabatta."
33166,2,"The Native is pretty good. Good beer selection though it is mostly dominated by domestic light beers. The wings are legit. Try the honey hot and if you're feeling a little crazy...get the suicide wings! They'll light you up!!!\n\nService is alright. Nothing too special here. They're a little expensive for what you get. For two of us at lunch, our bill was $32. Thats pretty steep for lunch."
3069,0,"You have to understand that this is not the only Farmers agency that screws the common folk.  For a wind damage roof claim, they send out Mr. Zero six days after the storm to AZ from TX, and the guy comes up with some lame reasons for a complete denial of a $25,000 claim.  Think long and hard before you ever associate with Farmers in AZ.  I guess they do not think dust, 70 miles/hour wind and torrential rains can do any damage to your roof.  Stay away from them and you will not be sorry."
47384,0,"Okay, they even get orders wrong as a walk in. I specifically asked for grilled chicken enchi's and she puts shredded chicken in them! Really? Next to that, customer service...horrible. Everyone in there looks so down and out, just slumming away; no smiles, speak to you very emotionless. One girl even says to a man that walks up to the counter \""ya what do you need?\"". Where is management at this place? I thought about asking to speak with a manager but seeing as how the employees are mummily (ya I made that word up) serving guests, I couldn't help but think that they are a reflection of how their management is allowing them to act, so it probably wouldn't be worth it. Such a shame the staffs personality and service doesn't match their delicious food."
3137,3,Get fuel here! Yay!
48691,2,This is an old alley way in a not fabulous section of the strip. It feels like a dirty alley all dressed up. It is way too skinny and basically a wind tunnel. \n\nWe went down to Linq to get some cupcakes from Sprinkles. We parked in valet which was amazing. The service I received with my two small children and a boat load of stuff was amazing! If every single valet was this good I would valet everywhere! \n\nThey have a nice little fountain next to Sprinkles with some chairs to sit and enjoy your cupcake or latte. They also have Ghirardelli and a Polaroid store and a Yard House and a few other places. \n\nFor me it didn't feel like all of this stuff should be in this place. It felt like they were trying to make something of nothing. I will probably be back but only because of Sprinkles and Ghirardelli.
16442,2,"I was so tired when I came Here and didn't eat as much as I had wished to!\n\nFirst of all, service was weird. That's something you never really heard of huh? Our waiter was attentive meaning he checked up on us a lot but he would ask us if we got this or that roll. A little odd because the chefs or him should be marking off what we ordered.\n\nSecondly this place not only has sushi but hamburgers, French onion soup, wings, fries, and a bunch of non-Japanese food items! That's pretty cool since some kids may not like sushi or too young to have it. \n\nSo my aunt and uncle did most of the ordering so I don't know what some of the names of the rolls are but Alfred R. Has pictures for you to see! \n\nExtra Spicy salmon salad: the salad and salmon was really good but my aunt and I couldn't handle the extra spiciness. Those chefs were true to their word. I felt like my tongue was on fire for 30 mins!! It was the good Kind of spicy but I could not eat at all. We ended up having them remake it.\n\nJohnny roll: this would have been absolutely delicious if the cucumber weren't so bitter. Maybe they soaked it in something to keep it \""fresh\"" or discoloration! \n \nOne of my favorite was crab and avocado wrapped in salmon! That is definitely a must try! The presentation was attractive and appealing to the naked eye! \n\nI believe we got the Jose roll and it was tasty but the albacore was a bit off. \n\nWhite tuna and salmon nigri were great! Seemed like their salmon was more fresh than their tuna at the time. Also they served this last so you could fill up on rolls first and then you can't stand looking at the nigri when they bring out. Smart and sly but not cool. \n\nThat's all I remember but I wished I had more of the nigri! Oh they serve mochi ice cream! \n\nEnjoy! :)"
49455,2,This a place to go if you like MEAT.  If you don't like meat then its not a good choice for you.  \n\nSo many choices for meat.. Its definitely a place to come back over and over.  Great atmosphere ... Just be warned... If you go around lunch time expect huge lines.  They really need a much bigger parking lot.

12228,1,"I really wanted to like this place because I've heard nothing but positive things about it. Sadly, I didn't like it at all. \n\nWe went here on a Friday night with a couple of friends and I couldn't believe I had never seen this place. But it could be because it's kind of hidden. \n\nThe place is super nice. I loved the ambiance and crowd. The service was really good. Its a nice place to pre- drink before goin out. We ended up staying there til they closed. And that's where they earned two stars.\n\nWe got burgers because the friends we were out with recommened them and claimed that they were the best burgers in town...Basically all the burgers are the same with slight differences. They taste the same though. I wasn't impressed. Delux burger has better burgers. \n\nThe next morning was hell. My bf and I woke up with the same symptoms of sickness. Mind you, we each only had ONE drink that night so we werent hung over. Their food made us sick! We were both so sick that we couldn't move. It was awful. \n\nBut even with all that, I really want to like them so I will go back and give them another chance."

1129,3,"It may look like a fast food joint on the outside but this place is local Arizona BBQ at it's tastiest. \n\nI ordered the 1/2 lb. pork rib dinner ($11.49) which came with two sides. They ran out of collard greens so I settled for two corn cobs.\n\nWith the ribs and corn my face and fingers are super messy from the sauce. Good thing I'm eating alone. The ribs were super delicious! I wanted to cover every bite in their BBQ sauce. It was that good. The sauce was slightly tangy with just the right amount of sweetness. Honey Bear's calls it Tennessee BBQ, but here in Phoenix it's oh so good."
39408,4,"Really good food! \n\nThe Gyro plate is such a GOOD DEAL! You get so much Gyro meat for your money. They give you a Greek salad, that is really fresh. Then you get a choice between fries or rice. And they give you so much Gyro lamb and beef. \n\nAnd it was really delicious.\n\nThe girl working the counter was very friendly. Restaurant was clean and so was the bathroom. \n\nI live about 15-20 minutes from here but I will definitely be back again."

16390,3,"Our first time there, we were looking for a relaxing dinner before the symphony. The service was excellent, the waitstaff knowledgeable and the food delicious. Next time I will order less! The fish chowder was as good as a chowder I got earlier this fall in a Maine restaurant. tI would have been enough in itself. The mixed grill with filet and salmon on a bed of grilled vegetables was excellent. Next time, I will order only one - probably the filet. I have not ordered beef in years - and this was a good reminder of how good it can be! Oh yes, there will be a next time!"

Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! \n\nI've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best.

27735,1,"Our service here was so slow, we thought we'd never eat. There was also confusion on the waiter's part about our orders. At least we sat somewhere away from the crowds."
9019,3,Very friendly staff. Food is cheap like any fast-food chinese restaraunt. The portions are huge for the lunch and dinner specials. The veggies are fresh just the right crunch. The food is better than the more expensive chinese restaraunts. Dissapointed with the egg rolls and the soups though. They can use some improvement but overall a quick and easy decision.
31079,4,"i thought this place was phenomenal. i was staying at the westin and got in around 9 pm. my american iphone was not working and i refused to pay $15/mb of service to yelp an open restaurant. i walked around and everything was either closed or called burger king.\n\nso i wanted to try something different. and man oh man....this place was awesome.\n\nso here's what i got: \n\nroast atlantic black bass & crispy rock shrimp with roasted onion and \nporcini risotto, truffle butter sauce\n\nare you honestly going to tell me that that doesn't sound good? unless you don't like seafood, mushrooms, or good food, then yeah, i can imagine you wouldn't like this dish. nor will you like 42% of restaurants on yelp.\n\nyes, it's a little pricey, but so are movies that everyone goes to, cars that everyone drives, houses people own, or awesome meals like this. BOOOOOM KNOWLEDGE DROPPED.\n\nthis was my first time to french canada, and this place i will always remember."
45361,4,"After asking a friend of mine of where to go - I took my SUV down to Island Auto for an oil change and a check engine light that was on in my car.  The owner was really nice and honest - he didn't give me the run-around or try to overcharge me.  My car was repaired well, and for a much better price than what the dealership wanted to charge me.  Will be back again!"
7074,1,"It's unfortunate that some of my favorite stores are no longer in the Biltmore and it's remodel by Westcor makes it look like all the other strip malls in AZ.... what happened to the old Phoenix Charm?  Where did it go?\n\nRumor has it that Biltmore pushed Banana Republic out and Restoration Hardware.  I know Gucci left b/c the rent was raised so high, they said F YOU- we are heading to Scottsdale, leaving the expensive eye wear to be purchased as Saks.\n\nI also heard that all the restaurants will be gone and condos will be going in there and up--- is this true????  Someone tell me!!!!\n\nThe most disappointing is the charm of the Biltmore is gone.  It's still pretty and nice to walk around but the charm is far gone.  It's unfortunate.  \n\nAlthough, my friends and I do think that there is an unwritten rule that only cute adorable children and precious doggies are allowed on the property and they must frolic and play on the grass.  So if you got an ugly kid, leave him in the car ala Britney Spears style."
13470,0,This place has gone to shits !! The food sucks and the service is horrible ! It used to be good but now it's the worse.. Don't go coz the food is not good n dry n disgusting.. Sorry to say
21406,1,"If you like quantity over quality, this is the place for you. The food is mediocre at best. I ordered the 2 eggs, hashbrowns with a side of pancakes. It was a lot of food for only $5, but the large portions with cheap prices is the only thing they have going for them. My bf got the chicken fried steak, which he could not finish becuase it was too fatty. We were really looking forward to the biscuits and gravy after reading the reviews. However, we were very disappointed, as they completely lacked any flavor. \n\nIf you are looking for good quality food, skip this place."
20440,4,"After Tuesday's great service, I went back this morning to replace the other tires on my car. I would like to say it was planned (half true) but I had *another* tire go flat on me this morning, so the plan was accelerated. I was able to air it up and go straight to Llantera... and I am glad I did.\n\nIn and out in less than an hour, I was given two almost brand new tires AND my tires were rotated and balanced. $80 out the door and I was in my office just after 9am.\n\nIt's not just the price. I could have gone to any number of places and dropped $600 on 4 new tires this week and been satisfied. But therein lies the difference... I would have been nothing more than satisfied. \n\nI drive an older sports car, I mostly commute and putz around town, and never take it on road trips. I have a lead foot on the gas and brakes, so my tires do take some abuse... OK, a lot. I can admit it. That said, \""almost brand new\"" tires are better than what was on the car when I bought it almost 2 years ago.\n\nThe point is that Llantera shows you what they have, gives you options, and makes sure you have the best tire available at an amazing price. Plus the rotation, balancing? It's an added plus that everyone is friendly and helpful and thoughtful (thanks for the bottle of water!).\n\nI am more than just satisfied, I am well taken care of and happy with the experience."
40234,0,Took my jeep in for a repair in march on  a tuesday afternoon and it was not looked at until friday! \nGot an appointment for a monday at 7:00 to get my transmission checked out. Explained to the service writer my previous experience of waiting and she assured me it would not happen with her! Wednesday at noon it STILL had not been checked out so I picked it up and took it elsewhere! WILL NOT BE BACK!
9365,0,Ever walked into an old establishment and feel like you leave needing  shower...welcome to Dona Maria. It's plain damp feeling and just unpleasant. The food was OK but being  regular lunch eater in the downtown area I'm glad I waited so long to try this place and it will be a long time before I try it again. Sorry!!!
7979,4,"I've always had a good experience at this Starbucks. I live basically right next door so I come here a lot and usually go through the Drive Thru and I've never had any issues. The staff here is really friendly and I like friendly people. \n\nOne thing though and this has to do with the customers not with Starbucks....if you are in the drive thru line with more than 2 cars behind you...YOU'RE IN TOO DEEP...don't try and \""back out\"" of the drive thru because that is obnoxious. Also, do not PARK directly behind the drive through on a week day morning because YOU WON\""T BE ABLE TO GET OUT. Literally, some dude came out to his car one time and he was parked directly behind the super busy drive thru and laid on his horn for literally like 5 minutes. WTF do you think that's gonna do you FOOL. Sorry you made a really terrible parking choice but don't punish the rest of us."
45585,0,"I gave it 0 Star. Arrived at 5pm and got seated but no menus were given. At 5:10pm asked for menus. Ordered food at 5:20pm. Got my 2 Thai Iced teas at 5:23pm, nice service is picking up! At 5:45pm asked why food hasn't arrived yet and was told that they are backed up and seeing the table behind us which ordered 10 minutes after us getting their order. Walked out at 5:55pm and still no food. Sad place for restaurant, could not even get a Shrimp Fried Rice in 35 minutes....."
20005,4,"I'm from SoCal and was at LV for my bachelorette party. On our \""recovery day\"" I decided to go get a brazilian done. I've only gotten waxed a couple other times and am still nervous about getting waxed down south. I yelped places around LV to go and BOX was the ONLY place that had 5-star reviews. \n\nNow I know why--they did an excellent job and I felt comfortable the entire time. The ambiance of the place is very chic and right when I walked through the door I was greeted and offered something to drink. \n\nThe lady who did my wax (I forgot her name!) was so professional and talked me through the whole thing even though I had a Brazilian before. \n\nI highly recommend this place!"
35850,1,"There's another review here which describes Saffron's interior as being more like a banquet hall than an Indian restaurant and I have to concur completely. When we arrived at around 8PM on a Saturday the large rectangular building was empty with the exception of two other pairs of customers at the round tables in the main part of the room. Down one side there are four half-booths, although only two of these appear to be available for customers, with one having a computer set up upon it and the other, outfitted with a pair of mismatched, padded office chairs appears to be used as a hangout for the proprietor's children when they aren't helping out with the restaurant.\n\nAfter being instructed by a small child to \""just sit anywhere\"" we took one of the open booths and another child brought us our menus. The covers looked slightly grubby, like they could have used a wipe down and I noticed a large stain on the side of the booth next door to ours - it looked like someone had spilled a large glass of coke over the side of the table at one point and that it had been allowed to set before washing. Chairs and tables were covered with plastic to ward off such spillages and the plastic on top of our table felt like it could have been a little cleaner also, as could the salt and pepper shakers which felt a little grimy when we moved them.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit odd and has a little raised section in the corner opposite the door and the 1970s disco ball in the middle of the room. The disco ball was just a mystery and I expected to see the four children from The Chronicles of Narnia file in and take their places in the four throne-like armchairs upon the curious dais at any moment. It was an unusual atmosphere.\n\nAfter a few minutes our host arrived with a jug of room temperature water with shrink wrap covering the top. He had collected this from one of the central tables which was home to a collection of such jugs. He seemed very friendly, however, and quickly accepted our restaurant.com certificate and enthusiastically took our order. In order to meet the $35 requirement we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, and a selection of Naan (two garlic, one sesame).\n\nOur host then presented us with some pappadums and the usual chutneys of tamarind and mint. The mint chutney had a nice kick to it and although the tamarind had an uncharacteristically odd \""ketchupy taste\"" it mellowed into a pleasant aftertaste so it all worked out. We were cheerfully informed that we could ask for more pappadums if we liked and as the host departed I commented to my wife about how the friendliness and enthusiasm was enough to make me overlook some of the oddities of the place in my upcoming Yelp review.\n\nDespite the fact that there were very few others in the restaurant we didn't see any staff again for the forty or so minutes it took for our food to arrive. I wasn't bothered at all by the longer than average wait time and the food more than made up for it anyway. My Chicken Tikka Masala was a little milder than I am used to, however the very nutty and savoury Shahi Paneer was a perfect accompaniment. I found my garlic naan to be tasty without being amazing, but my wife found her sesame naan to be a little overcooked on the bottom. The Malai Kofta was somewhat different to other incarnations of this dish that I've experienced. The sauce tasted more like a onion/butter sauce than creamy, but was tasty, however the kofta themselves were dark, somewhat sharp in flavour and fell to pieces at the merest touch of an eating utensil. Overall though, the food was excellent and we couldn't wait to return and I expected to award the restaurant four stars with a disclaimer about the slightly odd vibe to the place and maybe a friendly suggestion that they wipe up a bit in my review.\n\nThis is where things took a turn for the worse. A medium sized party had entered the restaurant and placed their orders just as I was enjoying the last bites of sauce-dipped naan and they also appeared to have a couple of take-out customers. Our host asked me how everything was to our enthusiastic responses and disappeared into the kitchen.\n\nI got my credit card out and politely sat at the table waiting to deal with my bill. Twenty minutes later we were still waiting. Ten minutes later I asked a child if they could ask someone to help us with our bill. Twenty minutes passed and a surly woman came out, but it was to deal with a takeout customer. The child still clutched our bill and restaurant.com certificate. Finally, after about an hour of waiting we were finally dealt with and could get out of there, lamenting that we could have driven across town to our home TWICE in the time we waited to pay for our meal.\n\nThe food here is great, but being made to wait a full hour (no exaggeration) to pay, including 30 minutes after you TELL THEM you want to pay is just unacceptable, especially when there were at least three adult staff members and custom was slow."
37715,1,"I was excited that they opened this restaurant and was excited to eat here, as I've been at a Steak 'n Shake establishment before. However, this place just did not live up to it's name. \n\nFood wise - this location was comparable to the other ones I've had. But, presentation wise - I was disappointed. It's not that hard to put together a burger - but yet they've managed to mess it up. Especially when I ordered the BBQ burger. Most of the bacon wasn't even on the burger - and there was BBQ sauce all over my plate. Looked as if someone had murdered the BBQ bottle on my plate. \n\nService is a complete joke. The first time we went - we ordered our shakes before we even ordered the food. And yet - we didn't receive them until about five minutes after we were done eating. \n\nThe second time - we saw our waitress only when she came to take our order. We didn't have a ketchup bottle on our table - and asked the person who brought the food if they could bring us one. They never did, so we took it upon ourselves to take a bottle from an empty table. Turns out - that one was empty. So we tried another - which was empty too. By the end of the meal - none of us had any water yet - so as someone was passing by, we asked her to refill our waters as she already had a pitcher. She re filled one of the glasses before running out of water. She said she'd be right back with another pitcher - but never saw her again. \n\nThis place needs to step up on their service and fire everyone there that doesn't know how to be a server. \n\nI would've given this place one star - if it weren't for the fact that I do love their milkshakes. Just stay away from the Butter Pecan one - but it tastes nothing like butter pecan ice cream."
39053,0,Blueprint needs some work. The feel of the restaurant is all over the place. They need to get one theme and stick with it. The food is average at best as well. Today was the second time I have eaten at Bluprint. The brunch prices are way to expensive for the portion size and quality of the food. They don't use fresh ingredients and charge prices like they do. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros and both were $15. The burrito was very small and had bad store bought sliced sausage and maybe 10 black beans. The shell was so big all you ate was that and nothing else. The hash browns were bad as well. They didn't have any flavor. The huevos were set in front of us and the first thing is saw were un cooked eggs. How the cook sent that out to a table I will never know. The white of the egg was still clear! We mentioned it to the manager and he said he would fix it. After talking about the price and the poor quality of the food we had already ate we decided to get up and leave. We paid for the burrito and left. That is the first time i have ever done that. If you are going to charge $15 for breakfast items they better be great with fresh ingredients or good and big portions. This place is neither. Bluprint won't be around if they don't change and do it quick.
35622,0,"ZERO STARS!  I don't know why we punish ourselves by returning to this place after promising to never return. I guess deep down inside you hope that major changes may have occured but alas....\n\nI am beggin my fellow Yelpers to never, ever make the mistake of going to this sorry excuse for a restaurant unless you enjoy a dirty restaurant, cold food, old food, bugs galore (gnats, flies, and spiders oh my!..I'm sure I could find a roach if I looked hard enough), sh*tty management, snotty hostesses, the buffet-attendant drinking a drink at the buffet, and probably the worst & most unfriendliest waitresses you could possibly have, \n\nTake it from me. Go elsewhere. PLEASE. If I could afford to pay for billboard space in their parking lot, I would warn the world to stay away. Heck, I'd even pay you guys to put this up on ROTD just to help spread the word.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
21084,1,I heard the food is good. I will visit very soon
34814,3,"HOLD IT. HOLD IT. As some of you know, I am on an ongoing mission to find the greatest Eggs Benedict in all of Egginburgh. For many months, Kilimanjaro Coffee has held the crown. No longer. No longer.\n\nI don't know what made it so amazing here. The bacon, for a start, is not how I like my bacon - it was streaky and on the side, instead of back rashers sitting snugly under their eggy blankets. And yet. And yet. And yet. The eggs were poached to perfection and, once cut into, ran free and wild across my plate with joyous abandon. The muffins on which they were served were light and fluffy. The hollandaise was absolutely packed with flavour - with the addition of a quick sprinkle of black pepper, it blew my mind. And the bacon... just... worked. It just did. It's magic. The dish, teamed with a creme caramel rooibos, set this urban wanderer winging her way, harp and all, up to cloud nine in seventh heaven.\n\nUrban Angel is surprisingly capacious inside, made of lots of little rooms, but don't come here if you suffer from any kind of body dysmorphia as much of their decor consists of mirrors - including a charming pair in the shape of wings. The recess into which the hand basin fits in the poky little ladies' is also panelled with mirrors (which is kinda weird when you stand up to pull up yer knickers, know what I'm sayin'?). It's also below street level so you'll more than likely lose phone signal.\n\nBut when they've got eggs like that, and a menu that includes a raw chocolate shake, endless smoothies, Eteaket teas, Edward & Irwyn hot chocolates, and lots more unbelievably scrumptious things, you can forgive a few little things like that."
5099,1,"This is my second time coming here and I dont  plan coming back. Although the drinks are delicious, the service is the worst. My friends and I were only allowed 40 minutes to order even though there was still an hour left on the clock. Our waiter spent half of our 40 minutes ignoring us. After finally getting his attention and order we tells us they're out of boba. What?! I work at a boba place in California and we will make boba or any drink even if it is 5 minutes before closing. Our customers are very important to us and are given great service, it makes them happy and more likely to come back.  I wasn't able to finish my taro slushy so I asked a waitress nearby if I could have a to go cup, and I'm not lying my friend Lia noticed this as well, the waitress rolls her eyes, flipped her head and makes a sound. I was like woah! JUST BEYOND RUDE! Although this place has convenient hours in las Vegas' Chinatown and yummy drinks, this place really doesn't know the meaning of customer appreciation and good service."
4128,4,They have good food. Been eating here since I moved down 10 years ago. I like their toasted subs and the pizza is excellant! My husband likes the wings and bread knots. Happy Hour is also a bonus.\n\n They are Phoenix Suns sponsors and host the Gorillla during the season. My kids loved eating thier gluten free pizza and meeting the famous Suns Gorilla! Very relaxed family friendly atmosphere. Always welocoming you with a smile when you enter.
34455,4,"Their products, service and prices are phenomenal. Their product prices got my business and their prompt and courteous customer service and amazing product quality will keep me coming back. I know that once my order is placed I don't need to worry - it will done correctly and on time!"
33073,3,"I went to all the big box stores as well as Lumber Liquidators before going to check out Floor and Decor which is a ways from me. I have nothing negative to say and happy to detail my experience. \n\nLooking for new flooring (laminate/wood flooring) after my house had a flood. I did like a few ones from Home Depot...but by the time I got back those items were sold out (online as well). Hard to believe but I guess I have great taste or something.\n\nDecided to check out the \""Walmart of flooring\"" and not disappointed. Sure the staff seems to be like at Walmart which means they are nearly invisible if you want them to be but I was able to get help fairly quickly and kindly as well. \n\nWhat gets them the four star review is that the wood flooring I wanted at their Tempe store was sold out (I bought all the remaining stock, about 20 boxes) but I needed twice that amount. The service counter told me their Tucson store had some and I was told to call because their payment processing system does not allow you to pay over the phone. That is why I give them 4 stars and not 5 because it would have avoided me having to call their 800 number to make an order only to be told to that that order would be from the Tucson store anyways. Confusing and something they should fix. One should be able to simple call any nearby store, prepay for the item and be able to pick it up. This wasn't the case with them. I was however very satisfied with their call center because the order was $100 or so above my daily credit card limit and I was unable to make the full payment when the shipping costs were added. They kindly removed enough shipping costs that I could conclude the transaction and not only that but the call center customer service rep recognized me and made the process very easy when it could have been a major headache.\nIf they can fix their current payment process, they deserve five stars and you can't beat the options and the fact that this place covers all your flooring needs."

20129,1,"This review is for 10.29.2014.\nWalking this spacious environment, my friend and I were happier and more pleasant after great brunch. \nI tried to reload my card. The agent, Zik (I am not sure about the spelling of his name), was impatient and didn't know how to reload the card. He had to ask 2 other agents for the processing. \nWe presented the promotion code for 25% off via the email with my cell, and again, he failed to process it. After a while of wait, he told us, he couldn't enter the code. Without asking for supervisor's help, he looked at us and said NO. He was obviously not willing or intended to help even we were the only customers in line. We sensed that waiting any longer wouldn't do any good but ruin our day. \nThere were no smiles or greetings, no asking my name or choice on the milk, and no name on my cup the entire wait or purchase.\nA beautiful day-off with great hanging out with friends, just ruined by him."
29396,1,"I heard many good things about this place and so was excited to try it out.\n\nMy friends and I ordered the Thai Beef Salad, Asian Chicken Salad, Monsters Meatball and Spaghetti, and Grilled Salmon. We were extremely disappointed. I don't even know what the meatballs tasted like. The spaghetti and salad dressings were BAD. The rice was hard. The salmon was a-ok, but the portion was small compared to other dishes.\n\nOn the bright side, I tried their famous frozen hot chocolate, and I loved it! We all loved it! Totally made my experience better. \n\nI don't know if we didn't order the right food, but I'm definitely not coming back here for their food, ONLY FOR DESSERT!"
20287,4,"Divine Cafe is truly befitting of it's name. Wonderfully fresh ingredients help create their many variations on lunchtime staples. This stuff is made-to order, and it most certainly has the \""from scratch\"" appeal. The prices are affordable and the service is friendly. When you dine-in, you're greeted with a basket of tasty homemade chips and a dip that's delightful. A word to the wise, if you're in a hurry and looking to take-out, it may be to your advantage to call ahead. They take what their serve seriously, so the wait for a sandwich can be longer than one would expect and more importantly longer than you have time for during your lunch hour."
15288,1,"Slow service and 15-20 for mediocre philly cheese steaks.  Sandwiches and fries do not have a lot of flavor.  Also the televisions are blaring loud, if you have sensitive hearing beware.  Seating is limited."
23694,3,"Was here a couple of weeks ago for a Gammage Goers event. Love this cute little place right on Mill Avenue! The bruschetta was tasty and a good price for the quantity! The service was really slow (we waited around 15 minutes for the check), I think because it was St. Patrick's Day she was a bit overwhelmed, but I definitely want to go back to try more items. Especially their Sangria. ;)"
33279,0,"took my sis and the kids here for a quick bite after shopping and i was very disappointed.\n\nThe location is like any other RR in cleanliness and atmosphere, your basic family friendly sports bar.. but this visit was just terrible.\n\nThe waiter forgot half the stuff we ordered, brought mixed up sides, and a wrong dish all together... took forever and then the manager came and corrected everything after we had to wait...\n\nWe were very specific about a couple of things, like the temperature\n for the little ones food and it was ignored.\n\nDining with little ones is always an adventure no matter what you do, so it helps if the staff understands and does their best to make the process painless.\n\nI probably won't come back here."

14689,1,"we dined here on our first wedding anniversary. We had high expectations from this AAA 4 diamond and michelin rated restaurant. we chose this one in particular since the menu appealed the most to us.\n\nWhen we walked in at peak dining hour, we were surprised to find the restaurant so empty (not that we mind). En route to the restaurant we did find a lot of activity at other bellagio restaurants which makes me wonder why this place did not attract any crowds. The location is also not as attractive as the other bellagio restaurants facing the musical fountains.\n\nThe cocktail we ordered on our server's recommendation was the most disappointing $14 cocktail I've ever had. It just tasted like cucumber water.\n\nWe always wanted to try the hamachi crudo and decided to give it a shot. It comes with green apple, winter black truffle, tempura crunch. Everything combined it was very tasty with the tempura providing the crunchy texture.\n\nOur server recommended \""three seas\"" tasting of japanese fish, bamboo rice, ginger vinaigrette so went for it. There was scallop, hamachi and snapper. They all tasted the same since the ginger vinaigrette was too overpowering. Paying $45 for that dish was a complete waste of money.\n\nWe had the TRUFFLE-STUFFED CHICKEN with SAVOY CABBAGE, SUNCHOKE-PEAR PUR\u00c9E, FOI GRAS RICE. There were hardly any truffles to be found in the chicken. moreover, the chicken itself was bland and unseasoned. The savoy cabbage had some flavor and foi gras rice was probably the star of the dish. \n\nFor a michelin rated restaurant, the food fell short of expectations. I've dined at a lot of fine dining restaurants and have had better bang for the buck than here."
8663,1,"I went here on the recommendation of a friend.  I was not impressed.  The location/neighborhood is scary.  The restaurant is old and outdated inside.  The prices for the complete dinner was very reasonable.  The spice level on my meal ordered mild to medium came out HOT. (compared to others at my table and the way they ordered their dinner).  The naan was good when hot, not so good as it cooled down.  The mango lassi was delicious! The service was inattentive and lacking.  I won't go back."
4688,0,Ok so I have purchased items from RC Wiley and have spent a lot of money but will never again. I had a $500 credit limit after I purchased my fridge and when  iwent to use it towards ny bed room purchase it was no longer available due to me paying it off too soon????? (Apparently since I paid $500 in 2months instead of $25 in 10 months) When we attempted to question what they meant and if there was anything that couldbe done the supervisor emele pretty much told us to take a flying leap -are you serious!!  So I spent my $2300 at Ashley furniture. RC Wiley apparently is balling and they don't need me to buy anything. Good luck! when u have poor customer service reps representing you like that their making your company look bad.
27472,2,"The fruit and veg from here isn't always at its best and I did once buy a bag of plums from here on the cheap just to find they'd gone off, but it was on the cheap and luckily for this review I know to slow cook them and they turned out to be delicious.  This means there is a risk if you are buying the really cheap or out of season items, but other than that you should be okay.\n\nIn general I don't want to put you off because there are some nice items on offer here, but you do want to keep your eye out for something that's simply too far gone."
32448,2,"(+)\n- The DJ was on point.  Played a good mix of hip hop, house, and old school music.\n- Room to walk; wasn't overcrowded like other clubs.\n- Great decor\n- No cover for being on guest list (but see below).\n- Sexy go go dancers, at least the ones I saw.\n\n(-) \n- $18 each for a Monster Vodka.  I don't even pay that much at more upscale clubs here in L.A., or any other club in Vegas.  At least our girls got free champagne to balance out the expensive drinks.\n- One of the dudes at the front was a douche.  Typical.  We waited on one side of the square \""line\"" for maybe 30 min or so, and when we got to the front he told us that we needed to order bottle service or go to the back of a different \""line.\""  We refused and didn't move.  Then a very nice lady came to us, asked us if we were on the guest list (which we were), and let us right in.  So take that, stupid ass douche!\n\nAdvice:  Get on someone's guest list.  Don't let the douche bouncers get to you.  Roll with girls.  Look for a nice lady worker to assist you instead of the douche guys."
38210,0,"My fianc\u00e9 and I attended a dinner party here. Immediately, I noticed it was crowded and had live music. I took that to be a good sign. \n\nUpon glancing at the menu, I noticed some very unique dishes. Butternut squash enchiladas? Who knew? I also noticed prices averaging around $20 per plate. That was slightly off-putting, but I was excited to try something new. I expected hearty portions and fine food. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered the Kobe burger, topped with applewood bacon, Brie cheese, and apple-jicama slaw. He liked the burger, though he ordered it well done and it came out medium to medium-well. However, it was about half the size of a burger you would expect to see at twice the price. \n\nI ordered the short rib chili with cornbread dumplings. I was not pleased. It was incredibly greasy and the meat had hunks of fat still attached. The cornbread dumplings were good, but there were only three of them, each about half the size of a ping-pong ball. Altogether, our meal cost about $50. It's worth mentioning that we did not order any alcohol, and we were still hungry after leaving. \n\nIn short, if you are looking for unique flavors in a downtown atmosphere, you would probably be quite impressed. If you are looking for decent food at reasonable prices, I would suggest eating elsewhere."
42678,2,"The ham and cheese croquettes are delicious.  The meatballs were okay.  The artichoke appetizer was okay.  With so many options to choose from, I will go back and try more.  But, I will have the croquettes again."
1217,1,"This place is fun to walk into, as it really looks like you're walking into a Depression era drugstore, not the 50's. It's crammed with old pharmacy stuff and signs, just lots to look at.\nI really wanted to love this place but I can't because the service just isn't what it should be. We were helped by two of the staff during our visit, one very friendly waitress who breezed by and said hello  and a waiter who couldn't have appeared more miserable.  \nI was surprised at how small and, hate to say it, dull, the menu is. Burgers, hot dogs and cold sandwiches. The burgers are from frozen patties and I actually had to pull a big chunk of cartilage out of my mouth. Yuck.\nThey use Thrifty brand ice cream and have an extensive menu of ice cream sodas made with unusual flavors. We ordered our sundaes and for some reason, they were made one at a time, so that my companion was halfway through with his before mine was delivered, and it was completely wrong. Wrong ice cream, wrong topping. But it took so long to get that I just ate it. I'm not going to complain too bitterly over ice cream. And I hope this place works out its kinks and does well."
23085,0,"I have been to this Walmart four times now, and each time I go, it is never a good experience, not even an acceptable one. I went today, and there was empty shelves in all I'll. They hardly had any stock\nIt's dirty in there, and none of the employees are happy that they have a job. I know I know, I shouldn't expect too much excitement from a Walmart employee, but still, they don't have to be rude\nAvoid this Walmart at all costs, I know I will from now on"
940,4,"The best vintage shop in Champaign! Scott and Amanda are always up for a chat about mid-century furniture, and are lovely people.\n\nFurniture Lounge is simply the best shop to go to if:\n\n* you are redesigning your home and need furnishings, lighting, decor\n* you are trying to find a unique gift for a friend or relative\n* you love thrifting, antiques, or vintage\n* you love mid century modern design\n* you want to look at something interesting and beautiful!\n\nThey recently started taking credit via Square reader in their new downtown Champaign location."
10861,0,Before  I rant... the Manager did take one of the plates off our bill...so that was a plus. \n\n\nWe looked up the best BBQ places in Vegas (Google) and this place was at the top. Looking over the reviews on Yelp we figured it was going to be good. \n\nI ordered the pork sandwich with potato salad. My wife ordered the brisket plate with mash potatoes and collard greens. \n\nMy meal... it's hard to describe... the pork at no flavor at all...it's topped with coleslaw and BBQ sauce. I added salt...magic dust...and two kinds of BBQ sauce to get some sort of flavor going. The potato salad tasted store bought. \n\nMy wife's plate.  Brisket.... brisket should be fork tender... no knife should ever be needed. It lacked flavor as well... and was tough/chewy.  She thought it had the consistency of boiled meat. The greens tasted like they were from a can... no flavor/seasoning. The mashed potatoes...straight from a box.  (her meal was taken off the bill as she didn't eat 95% of it.) \n\nWhen you walk in to the place... you see the grand champion signs from 12 years ago over the doors... maybe this was a killer BBQ place back then... but... I can't say the same for it now. I would not recommend this place off the experience we had. I'm sure there are many more BBQ joints in Vegas worth trying...\n\nWill not be going back.
10363,2,I was really impressed with their Boca burger.  It's not every fast food hamburger joint that has a veggieburger.  I was really glad it was well done because I ordered everything on the burger.  It seemed like this place was always open; people were constantly lined up to try the Fatburger.
29546,1,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to downgrade my prior review as I've been disappointed the past couple times I've purchased from the Meat Shop.  The staff is still great, very helpful, but the product has let me down. \n First it was pork belly, the quality was not good-much fattier than my normal Asian market source but I figured homemade bacon's kind of a tough standard to judge quality as it's smoked and cured.  I then did a head-to-head with spare ribs and the ones from the Meat Shop were thin and tough while the ones I got at Smart & Final were meaty and juicy.\nI suppose if I better express what I'm looking for I might get better results but just because I don't that shouldn't mean I get crap, especially for triple/quadruple the price of the regular grocery store."
32369,2,"Ok kids. Lets be honest here - this is NOT the best poutine place in montreal.\n\nWhat is it then? Well it's 24 hours and its a damn good place to come after the bar.\n\nThe poutine gravy could be better, and hotter. But what is amazing is the sheer choices - meet over meet over meat over veggie (oh yeah, those)\n\nThe portions are huge.\nThe options are limitless.\n\n\nMy favourite is t-rex when i'm hammed. \nSo please do come here, but let's not call it the best poutine in montreal."
19110,2,"Always packed to the walls on the weekends so plan accordingly. As usual, no gourmet pizza here of course but I still love coming here because they make a super tasty pizza! It reminds me of my childhood."
2941,3,"Paradise Juice is a daily ritual when we're staying in Paradise Valley.  The freshly-made juices on the menu are great but PJ comes into it's own when you customize the standards.\n\nI love Kale, and getting a Green Juice made of primarily Kale instead of the basic offering of cucumber was no problem.\n\nIt's not the cheapest juice bar in town but you get what you pay for; Paradise Juice is worth every penny!"
49436,1,"The employees were incredibly kind and even offered me something that was not available at the counter. I wasn't incredibly impressed with the flavors and felt there was some ingredient that I just didn't like in many of them. Not to mention, many of the ones I tried were very rich and I love rich flavors but I wasn't crazy about any of the ice creams. Maybe better luck next time- also felt the scoops were bit over priced."
40289,4,"Delicioso!\n\nKind of expensive for a popsicle, but its really good, and they have rent to pay!!\n\nDefinitely worth the splurge!"
49776,2,"My wife and I decided to try this new pub in Fitchburg on our date night. The place was hopping at 5pm on a Saturday! We ordered chicken fingers for an appetizer with some sweet potato fries. The chicken fingers weren't impressive and neither were the fries. FYI, the side of fries with the chicken fingers are prepared differently than the sweet potato fries appetizer which comes some sort of spicy seasoning. I wish I would have gotten that instead.\n\nI also tried the French onion soup. It was very good and not too salty. My wife had the fish fry and I had the spicy blue burger. Both were tasty. A huge party foul though...I ordered my burger medium and it came well done. I was hungry so I went ahead and ate it, but obviously, not a good first impression. On a side note, the offer Sriracha at the tables as a condiment. I ordered a ramekin of mayo and made my own spicy mayo to dip my sweet potato fries in. Very delicious, but too bad they don't do this already.\n\nOverall, the visit was good and the pub has a great fresh look and ambiance. There's nothing unique enough for me though (no brewery, small space, food was so-so). I might give it another try after they work out the new place jitters."
3430,2,"A bit of an older b&n but it has all the essentials.  Good, clean store and friendly employees make the experience even better."
43638,3,Such a cool place! Stopped in for lunch and had a wonderful experience. Even got a free appetizer for checking in! Split an order of delicious calamari followed by a lobster roll. The roll was messy but worth it. Would definitely return and recommend to friends.
6529,1,"The entire property is run down, kinda creepy and pretty yucky.  I had rented some inline skates thad had moldy inserts.  I think they may be the only roller rink in Madison so you don't have too  many options.\n\nObviously this place is popular with kids and they don't seem to notice all the blight so we would just grin and bear it."
30844,2,"With the recent closing of RE Tapas, this restaurant is the closest tapas bar in the area.  So the husband and I thought we'd give it a whirl.\n\nNo sangria with my tapas?  They did tell us beforehand that they weren't getting their liquor license until next week so we can forgive them.\n\nWe ordered: \n- Barcelona's Fries.  It was delicious with a good sauce.  Worth your money for $4.50.\n- Stuffed Mushrooms.  Pretty good and wanted more.  Shitake mushrooms stuffed with chicken & chorizo and parmesan cheese.\n- Surf and Turf.  Thought it wasn't worth the money for $10.\n- Empanadas.  Choice of chicken or pork.  We got the pork and it was delicious with a chipotle aioli sauce.  My only beef was don't put empanada(s) as plural and just cut one in half.\n- Sliders.  These were overcooked and charred.  I would've complained but I'm not one to ever send a dish back.\n\nAll in all, an okay dining experience.  I left feeling underwhelmed and wishing I had to gone to Firefly instead.  Maybe next time they'll win me over with some excellent sangria."
35793,1,"Disappointing.  After reading the positive reviews,  we gave Vida a try for dinner.  I agree with another reviewer that it was subpar.  Better choices are out there"
40364,0,"As we eat out more than we eat at home we decided to try East Ocean.  We drive by it on Eastern all the time.  One star is all I can say.  The Dim Sum was wonderful but no where did it list prices. The entrees yuck  would rather go to Panda Express.  This is so over-rated will not go back.  The service was so so (we did get refills constantly on our sodas) watched a female start taking an order from a table and her cell phone rang, she answered and walked away from the guests placing their order.  AND then she walks to us and her phone rings again and she answered, guess we should have left then.  Lots of tables available and there was only 5 tables that had guests (we were there 5pm)"
20069,4,"Try the soondubu jjigae and bibimbap! Every meal comes with 6 korean side dishes, so I always leave satisfied. The waitresses here are very kind, helpful, and smiley. One of them even helped me with my korean, which I greatly appreciated. I highly recommend you try this place out!"
15063,0,Complete assholes. Nuff said
36313,2,"Tried my first poutine! Exactly what it says fries, gravy and bland little cheese balls. I think the rendition was good but the sentimental taste is better than it actually is.  Burger was average but on a nice roll. Street watching priceless!"
34782,4,"From the street this place looks tiny, but make your way down the stairs inside or the (slightly) rickety metal steps down from George IV bridge and you'll find an elegant dining room where they serve one of the best lunch deals in Edinburgh: a starter, mains, and two sides for about seven quid.\n\n\n The food is upmarket without being pretentious; and if I can't speak of their desserts that at least tells you the portions are more than hearty and didn't leave any room to try them! My companion qualified her starter of tomato and basil soup as pretty much a meal in itself.\n\n\n Very good service too in formal yet relaxed surroundings. Don't watch the large clock on the wall and let your lunch hour go..."
25463,2,"En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral je ne suis pas un grand fan du palais des congr\u00e8s. L'endroit est tr\u00e8s grand mais n'a pas a assez de toilette.

22870,1,"I wish I could give this place more stars but- like everyone says its over price, slow service and the food is only ok. You are better off going to the Starbucks in the hotel and getting a muffin."
17612,3,"Aside from debating the merits of what constitutes a four star vs. a five star review with Bonnie G and Erica O (aka Judith Light from Who's the Boss), or the Carrie Bradshaw-like storytelling from Sarah K., I can't really decide what the highlight of the evening was.  Here are the highlights of the Lost Leaf. \n\n. Great lighting, \n. Awesome hardwood floors, \n. Exposed brickwork everywhere \n. Near-perfect sound level at just the right decibel for the late 20s and 30s Downtown scenester crowd inside.\n. Art created by locals adorns the walls.  \n. Cool little side patio for smokers.\n. Diverse bottled beer selection (perhaps that's to make up for the lack of beers on tap - which is zero.\n. Awkward bar layout - that makes for difficult traffic flow to back half of bar when it's busy.\n\nYes, this is a hybrid bar - art gallery, and I like it a lot, but not enough to warrant a five star rating.  Why?  Something seems a bit lacking here and I'm not sure what it is.  Regardless, this was a great place to hold the first-ever Yelp event.  It's a great space, don't get me wrong, but I can't say enthusiastically it's five star.\n\nHere's a tip:  AVOID on a First Friday.  It's way too packed and not worth waiting in line to see and do."
26416,4,Was in town for Labor Day and had a BLAST at this place!  Love dueling pianos. It felt like Silky O'Sullivan's on Beale (but classier).  Will frequent this place every time I'm in town!
15586,0,"I try and I try and I try to like this place but the only thing Fleming's does consistently is let me down!  Simply said... our shrimp appetizers came out sans deveining.  Yes, the digestive track of the shrimp were right there for us to see.  Next, my veal chop came out raw.  RAW!  Cold and uncooked in the center.  I sent it back twice, and finally just gave up.  Amateur hour again.\n\nTo their defense, I had an amazing steak at the Dayton, Ohio location.  But at least four other locations have let me down.  Sigh..."
40348,1,The lobster mac and cheese was terrible. I also tried the lobster ice cream which was another terrible idea. Won't come back for anything else. Located inside the Planet Hollywood.
23855,2,"Maybe it's because I've enjoyed many a meal at the Sushi Samba locations in NYC, and maybe because I was a little hungover from the previous nights festivities, but I was not overly wowed by lunch here with two of my lady loves with whom I was vacationing. \n\nOne thing that is always a priority on vacation is food. It has to be, this is a break from the mundane life I leave behind, so why do I want to eat my standard weekly fare of life in the working world? I love sushi and because of it's nutritious nature figured this would be a great way to replenish all things lost to bottomless cocktails and greasy late night foods. I didn't partake in the consumption of any libations at lunch, but did hear that the mojito was pretty stellar.\n\nI ordered the trio seaweed salad that came beautifully presented on a three trayed dish of hijiki, wakame, and my favorite aka-tosaka. Each were lightly dressed with lemon and sidelined with some tomato caviar. Not terrible for a $11, but not overly substantial either. For lunch I ordered yellowtail jalapeno which was ok if not a little heavy on the jalapeno, and a spicy tuna that was all sorts of bland. I think I would have been happier enjoying these as a happy hour because it seems that the prices are a little easier to swallow for the quality of the food. I didn't order anything complex, and maybe they just let the \""easy\"" stuff slide, but I wasn't terribly enthused enough to want to go back and give it a second shot to see just how good the rest of the menu is according to the higher ratings given."
33354,4,"My wife and I have gone to this place countless times along with our daughter. My wife always gets a full pedi with flower etc. pricing is average but all of the staff are good. I don't always want to get a full pedi, so I just get a callous removal which is $10.00. I don't need all the extras and there seems to be nowhere else in chandler that does this for $10.00. We will continue to go back!!"
8213,4,"Every time I go to Scottsdale, I have to come here for dinner.  Since it is only about once a year, I HAVE to have the BBQ Salmon!  It is consistantly awesome, I promise.  We start with the queso dip and the iron skillet corn bread but honestly that salmon is a star and believe me I usually choose steak over fish.  This is a winner.  Where I live we have Houstons and I have pleaded with them to have the corn bread, cheese dip and BBQ salmon put on the menu.  They have declined...pity."
17362,1,"This is perhaps the single most overrated place I've been to in Las Vegas.  I'm not sure why it's packed all the time except that it has a nice atmosphere and a great location.\nWas not impressed with the sushi ,the pizza, nor the drinks.  They had some gals walking around giving out beer - that was cool eye candy but I can go to about 1,000 places locally for that.\nDon't get it - prices aren't great either.  It is a nice happy hour place since the atmosphere is really cool.  But just not understanding the big appeal."
41231,2,It was okay they're definitely good at trying to up sell you! Was trying to do just 30 mins then ended up doing 45 mins. They later tried to get me to do 60 mins lol! The ambiance was good there was a dark room with soft music. It was a little weird because there were two other guests when I got in the room with a screen divider being the only thing separating us. The therapist did minimal talking the only downside is when they did talk they talked to each other in their language and they didn't speak English very well.
2397,1,"The waiter was nice and very friendly tonight. The bread and salad was good. But the linguini and clams was kinda gross. It was nothing new. The sauce tasted plain and the clams were already on the noodles. It's more spontaneous when you can open the clams yourself. The sauce was also really thick. If it was thinner it would have been better. The cheesecake was alright. I've had better and the portion is really small. I looked at it and said are you kidding me? It was like a \""fun size\"" but I was looking for the king size cheesecake. Other than that I don't think I'll be back."
26294,0,"We travel a lot and Total Wine is always one of our first stops when we get where we are going. Every other Total Wine in all other locations, 5 star. I would give this one -5 if I could. Not only is it small, over crowded, dusty and has boxes in the aisles, there is no one to help you find anything in the crammed together mess, when you do find someone, they are clueless about their products. The registers always seem to have people training and thee trainers are often rude to the customer and downright mean to the trainees.  On one of our trips over Christmas my 70 year old husband was refused his purchase because he didn't take his wallet, just took some cash, and couldn't prove he was of age to purchase alcohol! I am dead serious! We travel to Scottsdale every few weeks to visit our kids, Fry's will be our soul provider of wine, beer and spirits from this last trip forward. By the way, the favorite all time Total Wine to date, St. Pete, FL."

19775,0,"Initially I was excited at the proximity of a Krispy Kreme to the NY NY. Well, I was not impressed with what I found. Granted these locations are counters without fresh baking, however the products just looked sad. Since I was set on purchasing, I bought a dozen since the price was best buying a dozen. The donuts were dry and no where near the quality I am used to having from them. The glazed donuts that are pre boxed and sold in parking lots by kids groups were better than the sorry little things I got the other day."
18146,4,"One word can sum up my stay here:  Amazing!!! \n  I've been to Vegas several time but Caesar's ranks as my favorite! The service was stellar!.Every time I called the front desk to ask a question, I was addressed by my name. I was here for a conference and lucked out with an upgrade to the Augustus tower Jr. suite, thank you!!\n\nLocation is perfect with lots of shopping at the Forum shoppes tons of dining options!!\nHuge pool, casino, everything. Let's be honest, Caesar's is massive!! Right in the middle of the strip, plenty of action all around!!\n\nThank you Caesar for an awesome experience!"
45516,2,"I love the food bacon was amazing!\nPancakes weren't fluffy or that good. :(\nBUT hate the noise!!!!!\nYou can even hear yourself eat. It was crowded and everyone was talking, it got so deafing you couldn't enjoy your meal. \nThey need to do something about the acoustics in the restaurant."
13798,2,"We had the breakfast buffet during our midweek stay at PH. There was no line to get in, and it wasn't very crowded. There was plenty of good quality food. It is a big room, so the buffet is spread out. (But food is grouped .... fruit here, cereals there, pancakes/waffles, etc.) So my husband totally missed the fruit section, where they have the smoothies. And, he missed the hostess's instructions that a server would be around to bring drinks. So when he saw the fridge full of alcohol and water bottles he thought that was it and innocently tried to grab a bottle of water. He was immediately scolded and embarrassed by a manager who came shooting across the room to announce there would be a charge for the water. Use more tact here, he's not a criminal.  As far as buffets go, this is your average run of the mill one. Nothing to warn you about, nor really praise. Oh... The music level is a little loud. But we experienced that a lot in Vegas. Weird."
41892,1,"First time here....we live within 5 minutes but have waited to visit to allow them some time to work out the initial kinks of a new restaurant based on previous Yelp reviews.\n\nWe got there around 10:00'ish on a Sunday morning.  We were seated right away and got our drinks right away.  Restaurant did not seem overly busy to me. We had some questions about the menu, got them answered and placed our order.\n\nWe ordered the Paradise Valley Omelette and the Steak and Eggs.  It took 27 minutes for them to deliver our first entree'. The omelette was hot off the press, steaming and had some really nice hot, stringy cheese.  The Steak and Eggs was a completely different story.  The steak was cold, overcooked and tough.  Enough said so I sent it back. My next entree' (Eggs Benedict) came out in 5 minutes and it looked great.  However, the English Muffin was barely toasted, the ham was super thin, and the Hollandaise was tasty but it basically formed a pool on the plate.\n\nThere were some positives.  We ordered a side of the Jalepeno Bacon and it was really good.  I had the side of Biscuits and Gravy on the Steak and Eggs entree and the biscuits were good.  You could tell they were homemade.  Also, the homemade sausage gravy was great.\n\nOur waitress was really great and really seemed to know the menu well.  She did comp the Eggs Benedict entree after we talked about how weak the Steak and Eggs came out from the kitchen.\n\nThe food runner needed some help in a big way....I just kept seeing him flash in and out of the kitchen and running through the dining room. \n\nThe bakery items looked really good so I might go back to try them sometime in the future. \n\nOverall, I'd say about 2.5 stars but I've definitely had better breakfasts at other restaurants in the area.  I'm not completely convinced that I'd go back unless I knew it was going to be a better overall experience."
15848,2,"Total tourist spot. It is a great place to hang out and party for non clubbers and out of towners. Relaxed atmosphere, great music on the Strip without the crazy club scene. One note though; the flair bar tending is cool the first time you see it then it gets old...really fast. I actually went to a couple of these flair bar tending contests (I do not know what possessed me to attend such an event) but it is the same twelve people who competed for the last ten years. I even heard one guy say that he has a mock bar at his garage and he practices all the time. They even have a club/group for flair bartenders. Are you serious? Minus one star for lame a$$ flair bartenders. Easy with the tossing and heavy on the vodka."
19944,0,"I wish you could select 0-stars as the option here. I checked in to the location to get a quote \""free 100% hand wash\"". The rude man taking customers out front (with clipboard) realized I was a new customer going for a free wash and says: \""no you can't go car is too low\"". I am in a standard height Nissan coupe. \n\nI said ok... Then just spray it with the hose and \""hand\"" wash it. He says \""no you must pay custom price for that \""$24.99\"". They are simply abusing Yelp deals to draw in customers and immediately void the offer and upsell you. \n\nSteer clear at all costs."
16165,1,"Hickory Tavern trades out on what the Carolinas use to be and misses the mark on what Charlotte is.  Charlotte is a major city now.  It is still growing.  This new style (this location) is a move in the right direction.  Decor and layout are pluses, but menu selection and service leave a lot to be desired.  Let me re-emphasize the service.  It is not even close to being good.  I have been in this location three times now.  Only once did we have a server with a personality.  None of the times did the food come out in a realistic time frame.\nWhy oh why do I see cooks in the dining room?  Why did it take 25 minutes to get food on a day when they simply were not busy?  Oh, thats right... the cooks are watching TV in the dining room.  I guess the servers are in the back doing their nails."
30804,0,Here's another sucky airport bar with crappy food.  I ordered the nachos as they only had a few food items on their menu.  They sucked!  They were wet and flavorless. Make sure to ask up front to separate alcohol on your check.  I asked when the waitress brought me the beer I ordered and she told me they were already on one check.  WTF?  Go back and separate them then!  I will not be back here.  If you are looking for food before your flight I suggest stopping off before you reach the airport.
14049,4,"I have seen all of the Vegas Cirque Du Soleil shows and this is my favorite one.  I love that there are speakers in the headrests - that extra base and surround sound environment really makes you feel more aware of what is going on in the show.  I love when the speakers pick up the shooting arrows.  It sounds so awesome - like they are zooming by your ears.  The music is also really cool - lots of drums and even a heavy metal electric guitar song.\n\nThe stage feels like a futuristic Matrix or Mad Max environment.  This is a saga about a royal brother and sister that get separated when marauding tribesmen kill their parents during a summer festival.  There is a distinct Asian theme to this cirque.  The tribes people are tattooed like Hawaiians or the Yakuza, there is a Kabuki looking evil lord, and lots of Chinese style acrobatics.  The boy is guarded by the main family warrior who is this yoked shirtless hottie cakes with dreadlocks and a spear.  The girl is guarded by their overweight big breasted nanny and some clowns.  \n\nThe stage is a 360 degree revolving platform that moves horizontally and vertically.  The floor at several points is the wall.  There is this one scene where they are at the beach and then the beach turns into the wall and a zillion pounds of sand slides off of it along with one of the clowns who drops about 30 feet down.  There is another scene where the stage is supposed to be a mountain and the girl and her entourage is trying to climb to the top to escape the evil peeps.  As they are climbing up the wall there are evil people shooting arrows at them from the audience which in turn makes pegs pop out of the wall to simulate arrows sticking out of the wall.  The climbers swing in really pretty circles around the pegs.  The girl gets to the top and is sheltered by these Mongolian looking people.  It is now winter.  \n\nMeanwhile the boy and his stud warrior guardian hang out and make really cool shadow puppets.  They subsequently get caught by the tribesmen and get put in wheel shaped cages.  In the process there are a couple of other scenes including this one where guys are running and jumping rope on the outside of these hamster wheels that are revolving like a Ferris wheel about 30 feet in the air.  That may be the best acrobatics scene in the whole show.  While in captivity, the boy falls in love with the tribes' princess, who looks a little butch.  She releases him so that he can find his sister and then she does a cool baton twirling dance.  \n\nThe sister also falls in love with some dude in that sheer Britney Spears outfit with the little diamonds all over it and a red thong and they flirt with each other while flying around the stage from one of those hanging sheets.  Visually it is really pretty, but the dude looks like he might be a little light in the loafers with his long flowing hair and rhinestone outfit.\n\nI don't know how the brother and the sister reunite, but they do and they regroup and go to war against the evil Kabuki lord with the help of the tribes' princess' troops.  I forgot to mention that somewhere along the way the boy rescues the princess' dad from being captured by Kabuki face.  The bad people that tried to capture the boy and the girl are now on their side.  They go to war; the stage is again a wall and of course they win, get their kingdom back and the boy and the girl get married and all of the costumes are really pretty. \n\nSome other cool scenes include a boat on the stormy waters, an insect inspired rain forest act with swinging acrobats, and a flying contraption made to look like a bird that is operated by 5 people.  This is a must see theater production.  It was so worth the $340 we spent on tics"

30692,2,It was very delicious and tastey.
39669,2,"Came here last week in the evening decided to get off of the strip. Ok so my first thoughts when I entered was GHETTO but I had heard the crab was THE BOMB. Catfish was delicious and when they say the sauce is spicy they are NOT PLAYIN!! I had the Soft Shell Crab it was tasty. The Hawaiian sweet rolls were crusty hard, HELLO that is not how they are supposed to be served.\n\nDo not expect tremendous amazing service it was very casual and they were young and busy and seem to just want to make sure you got your beverages and order and that was IT! I think their clientele isn't necessarily looking for more so I get the feeling that is why they don't try harder.\n\nMy advice if you are a local order take out. If you are a visitor take heed.\n\nRespectfully Reviewed"
34025,2,"My bf and I have started a new tradition of weekend coffee. I am not a big coffee drinker but after trying starbucks, McD's this was next on my list to try. YUM. I didnt order donuts or anything else but I was tempted to order breakfast after reading about their offerings on the Eat This Not that emails I get. Next time I stop by I will have to try their breakfast and update my review. \nI will note that the coffee was about the same price as other places but they did fill it quite low to the line, like an inch!"
341,0,"Pamela's is an abomination of a breakfast place that represents the worst of everything.  However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.\n\nIt is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).\n\nIf you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.\n\nBetter alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Caf\u00e9 or even Square Caf\u00e9, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.\n\nFrankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.  At least they have heard of this thing called \""butter.\"""
28850,3,"I really liked this hotel and I am not a Vegas lover. If you are looking for a hotel that does not remind you at every moment that you are in Vegas this is the place for you.  Like THe Hotel in Mandalay Bay (another awesome non-Vegasy place), Vdara is smoke, slot-machine free.  And I also noticed a deficit in sock and sandal wearing tourists.  Bonus for sure.  Quick and courteous staff, although the concierge seemed to be a bit overwhelmed when I tried to set up some basic transportation.  The cafe on the first floor is cool, pricey...but when in the City of Lost Wages....oh! And the kitchenettes in the room are nice; you could actually have a pre-party in your room.  Last,but not least...the pool, by Vegas standards is sub par.  Find another pool to post up at if you can."
12999,3,"Mirrored ceilings? Check.\nFluorescent rainbow lights? Check.\nVegas eye candy? Check.\nHot tub & fireplace combo? Check. \nPeppermills on the table? Check. \n\nyeah, this place is sweeeeet.  And they make a BLT with avocado...BLAT!"
25064,3,"We love this place! We come at least once a month.  You can never go wrong with \""bottomless fries\""  as an appetizer and distractor for the kids.  The burger selection is good and service is always prompt and friendly.  I recommend signing up for there frequent diner card to earn free burgers for purchases and a birthday burger as well."
27854,3,"The Montreal public transit system is pretty sweet. For $3 you can jump on any bus (heads up they don't give change) or metro (they do) and get to most places on the island. Most of the core metro stops were originally built right before Expo 67 - in other words, a bunch of urban planners and artists spent a bunch of money to make beautiful transit that would help showcase Montreal to the world. Each original station featured a different Quebecois artist, so sometimes you'll pop out of the metro below giant stained glass, or come up the stairs to face an enormous sculpted tree. The Mtl subway system is the most used system in Canada, the city has been coordinating forms of public transit since 1861 and you do get the feeling that, though not perfect, it's something Mtl takes seriously and tries to do right. \n\nThe subway and buses are very clean and even kind of chic compared to Toronto or NYC's, and the system is simple to navigate: eg unlike other city's subways you won't have different trains running the same track, stopping at the exact same spot requiring you to read a sign on the train itself to make sure you've got the right one. In Montreal if you stand on the right platform, you're getting on the right train. \n\nThe monthly pass is called the Opus card, it costs about $70 a month for unlimited rides if you're an adult, but you can also just buy 10 or 20 rides at a time on your Opus card and they won't expire at the end of the month - a sweet cheap option for a commuter like me who doesn't need to use transit every day. When you swipe your Opus card at the metro turnstile it shows you how many rides you have left so you know when to refill. It doesn't have a photo on it, but you can register your Opus card number at Berri, Jean Talon, Snowdon, or Lionel to protect you in case of loss or theft. \n\nIf you're a visitor you can check out the 1 day or 1 week rates, but these have set start and end days and times that I find confusing personally. When folks visit me we just buy the $20 pack of 10 tickets - these can be used on the bus or metro, they include transfers, and they don't expire for a year (or more?) so whatever my guests don't use doesn't go to waste. \n\nWhen using these tickets on the metro just slide the ticket into the slot as indicated, wait for it to pop back up, then remove it and push through the turnstile.\n\nThe metro stops downtown - eg McGill, Peel - connect to the underground malls, so you can shop and wander indoors for miles in the winter. Calling this an underground city is overselling it, but for mall basements connected by tunnels and metros it's arright.\n\nThe metros generally stop running around 1am, except during nuit blanche when they run all night. There are useful night buses that run most of the major arteries, and the lineup for these at 3am is jovial, boozy and ridiculous (the one to Montreal West and the West Island leaves from Atwater). \n\nIn general I've had great experiences with the drivers and staff at the metros and on the buses - special shoutout to the singing driver who is beloved on every route he drives. The staff are mostly but not always bilingual, but anyway all the automated tellers have an English option. There is confusion every time they change the system, but that's to be expected and doesn't happen too often. There was a brief period when STM bus drivers all seemed like jerks because they would drive away from passengers trying to cross the street or running up at the last second to catch the bus, but someone seems to have changed their mind about this jerkiness being a good idea and now they act like kind-hearted humans again, waiting that extra second for little old ladies trying to catch the bus, and things are much better."
32208,1,"I signed up for a 30 min massage, I was not impressed. \n\nThe upstairs has leaks in the ceiling.  Additionally, when you are in the massage area, you can hear everything that is going on downstairs--which is not even mildly relaxing. \n\nAs far as massage....I've had better at a fraction of the price."
17179,0,"My stay at this hotel was beyond disappointing. \n\nI paid $310 a night for three nights. The hotel charged me for six nights though despite an email confirmation stating that I was only supposed to stay for three. After speaking to a few hotel staff and then finally two front desk managers, the decision was made - I was not getting a refund despite the evidence. To my complete shock and amazement, I was personally yelled at by Sheena at the front desk who was the one who accepted the charge of the additional three nights. Mistakes happen and it was fine.  But she didn't want to discuss it at all, let alone work out a resolution. I've never seen anything like this from a hotel. She interrupted me several times and then started yelling at me. She told me to stop talking because she wouldn't remove the charge anyway. I travel quite a bit for work and stay at hotels often. Believe me, this is not normal behavior even for $50 a night stay, let alone $310. \n\nLet's just say accounting issues weren't the only problems at this hotel. First, they call themselves a luxury hotel. It's truly false advertising because the hotel doesn't fit the definition of a luxury hotel. In order to be one you have to have at least a 4 star rating along with some amenities and services. This hotel is bare bones and rated at 3 stars. \n\nGetting my room serviced was a challenge. Housekeeping did not come to my room at all after 10am. Every time I called for service, I had to wait at least 4 hours for it. On my last day, I left the room at 9am. I came back at 2pm and the room still wasn't cleaned. I called for service and no one came by. Two hours later I called again for housekeeping. They finally cleaned the room at 6:30pm after two different people knocked on my door to see if housekeeping serviced the room. The housekeeper also complained about it and went on and on about internal issues with her manager and colleagues. She even complained about the housekeeping cart and how unmanageable it was. I tried keeping my head down to work and she kept talking. I had to leave the room for an hour because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nAside from new towels and made up beds, the room was actually dirtier after she left. The bathroom floors had been muddied up from her shoes and she left the old towels on the floor. Old shampoo bottles were still on the shower floor. She also pushed the desk chair in over my computer charger which got stuck and I had to turn the chair over to work on getting it out. It ruined my cable and I had to buy a new one. Unbelievable. \n\nThe toilet in the room was gross and very loud while flushing. I mean, seriously loud. It was almost frightening. It sounded like it was exploding and drowning a cat at the same time. This certainly added to the bizarre feel of the hotel. \n\nThe elevators were slow. One was broken, but it doesn't justify a 10 minute wait at 7pm during the week. I stayed on the 10th floor and had to take the stairs several times. I felt bad for the other guests that were older and had to take the stairs also. This was the recurring theme during my visit. \n\nFinally, one good thing! The restaurant food was good, although the choices were limited. Nothing fancy, but good burgers and sandwiches. The servers and waitresses were very accommodating and friendly. This was a bonus, and unexpected given how the front desk and other staff behaved throughout my visit.\n\nAs you can tell from the above, my stay was not enjoyable. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Stay at the Marriott or Hilton or a hotel that actually has their act together and can manage it decently."
3758,2,"Just played there yesterday with my wife.  It's a good course for beginners and other golf challenged people.  It was in fair shape.  The fairways and greens were pretty shaggy and the rough was mostly hardpan.\n\nDespite that, it was a fun round.  There are a few interesting holes.\n\nThe people in the clubhouse are super nice, so the after round drinks and food were great, too.  Great hot dogs!"
35589,4,"I'm starting to form an association with this place and watching movies at AMC AZ Ctr. Friday night I stopped by to have a dinner before seeing a film. Shortly after arriving, they addressed me by name and inquired about my bacon tattoo (thanks, Amy D!! They thought it was a hoot.) And they remembered I wrote about wanting the try the lamb ($27). \n\nIn a word: Phenomenal \n\nRubbed with Dijon mustard and topped with fresh herbs, the lamb was baked rare (I don't see any reason to cook lamb past rare; doing so destroys the terrific texture and flavor that make lamb such a treat for me). The manchego and chorizo risotto paired perfectly with the lamb. And I was surprised the cheddar basil waffle was actually a Belgium waffle in style as I was envisioning something much thinner. Yet it all worked remarkably well. \n\nNow I must acknowledge this was a spurge for me. At $27, I knew it was something I couldn't enjoy every week. But for that price, I was delighted with a generous rack of lamb and a hefty portion of risotto. In fact, it was entirely too much for me to eat in one meal. And as my leftovers sat next to me in the theater, I felt wonderfully fulfilled not only because I converted to Team Jacob but because of the knowledge I would have the best lunch in the office come Monday. \n\nCenturion is a damn fine restaurant."
25681,2,"I was looking for a slightly more economical place for dinner, in the vicinity of the Marriott, and happened to come across this place, also a very short walk from the stadium where the Canadiens were playing the first game of the conference finals. Don't let the name fool you. The food is traditional pub fare, but the atmosphere is definitely early-twenties. They have large screens conveniently placed so that you can catch a game from literally any seat, which was nice, but during commercials, they jacked up the rap music, which was highly annoying.\n\nIt's pretty clean, and wide enough to navigate in. After waiting a little bit to get noticed, I just grabbed the table closest to the door. Service was so-so, they're nice enough, but when my beer's gone, I shouldn't have to send up a flare for another one, and while they had a decent crowd during the game, they weren't overwhelmed by any means. It's okay when your staff schmoozes with the clientele, but it shouldn't be at the expense of other, thirsty customers. I chose to eat inside to watch the game and get away from all the obnoxious cigarette hounds outside (they have tables on the curb, like a lot of Montreal joints).\n\nI had the Cajun salmon. Their definition of \""cajun\"" means blackened to the point of being dry, with just the slightest hint of spice, but not terrible. The rice was completely tasteless, but luckily it came with grilled peppers, mushrooms, and onions. The salad was a pain in the ass, large and leafy and stuffed into a small bowl. Almost impossible to eat without it spilling onto the table. But overall the food was probably the best pub food I had of all the places I've hit in the last few weeks.\n\nSince it's a lower-priced place in an otherwise expensive area, I guess you get what you pay for. Their whiskey list is impressive, but given the tiny shots they serve, not worth it. Their \""trufflicious\"" cake was, well, just chocolate cake. Overall, it wasn't bad for the price, but it's not a place to impress a date with the food or atmosphere. \n\nI will say, it was good enough that I will give it a second shot next time in town."
34785,4,"This is my new favorite pizza restaurant. I must say the pizza is better than Metro. The pizza is very d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. It doesn't have that fake cheese taste. As I am writing this review, my boyfriend is considering picking up pizza from here. We eat here at least once or twice a week. My favorite the cheese pizza, great price. Highly recommend trying this place out. Spread the word about this restaurant.! You definately will not be disappointed."
27850,1,"I had been going here for years and thought they actually cared about doing good work for me. They once did... but as time passed, it got worse and worse. Unfortunately, since they messed up my last bass project... chipped my neck pocket and installed pick-up off center, etc... I will not be going back there again."
1508,2,"The only reason I am giving this place a 3 star review is because the service was excellent. The waitress was very friendly and gave us the perfect mix of attention and privacy. We were seated quickly, and had drinks a few minutes later. The food arrived equally fast.\n\nThe restaurant itself is your typical roadhouse. Its dark and a bit crowded feeling inside, with lots of stuff on the walls, and feels dirty, even though I'm sure it's clean. Prices were reasonable, especially considering the huge portions of food. I ordered their \""famous\"" Chicken fried steak. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but what I got was not what I was hoping for. the breading on the chicken wasn't very crispy and had very little flavor. The gravy had even less flavor than the batter and only succeeded in making everything soggy. The steak itself was cooked well but fatty, flavorless, and hard to cut. the salads and side dishes were equally mediocre. \n\nNothing special about TexAZ Grill."
27774,2,"The place was charming, and we enjoyed the food, particularly the brats and sweet potato fries, but to call it a serious restaurant is a bit much, since the fare is mostly pub food.  Our main objection is that the music is too loud and the sound system is terrible."
248,1,"D'Amico's is like...Olive Garden, only less festive and with more \""local color.\""  We came here for a coworker holiday dinner at 530 pm on a Thursday.  We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It's very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\n\nOur server was definitely \""set in her ways,\"" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \""does not compute\"" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \""...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\"" and I was all \""yes, I just got here....I don't even know what I want!\"" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \""oh, do you need a list or something?\""  I know, I'm one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I'm weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I'd recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money's worth.\n\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn't anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn't bother with the bread - it didn't look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\n\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn't think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn't help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn't a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people's dishes and my response was the same.  It's just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \""meh\"" the food was, I think it's way overpriced.\n\nSo I wouldn't go back.  It's not my kind of food, or place.  For all the Italian folks around here, I'm sure Pittsburgh must have way better Italian food offerings than this."
40117,2,"I have mixed feelings about Crescent Ballroom. I have been here maybe 10 times, only 2 of those times to see a show. The times that I have seen a show, I couldn't have been more pleased. The ticket prices are reasonable, there is plenty of room to stand or even sit and see the show, the sound is top-notch, and as an added bonus there is a large bar in the stage area. When it is not extremely crowded (more on that later), the lounge area is an excellent choice to have a few drinks, smoke on their patio, and I have heard the food is pretty good, too. I have no complaints about it when it is a slower weekday night. \nCrescent has been extremely successful and I am very happy to see it do so well. However, on nights of popular shows, or on Saturday nights when they do Kismet, the place is packed. Like WAY too packed. Takes ages to get a drink, and once you do have it, you have to drink it while being pushed and shoved by everyone around you. My biggest complaint though, is the bathroom situation. In the lounge area, there is one toilet. For everyone. This leads to a very long line of people that have been drinking and really need to pee. Also, you're talking about drunk people here, so people have no respect and are constantly cutting in the line or using the private locking bathroom for \""recreational\"" activities. The last time that I was there, it was a Saturday night and I was standing in line for the bathroom. I had been waiting for awhile, when 4 or 5 people rushed into the bathroom. They were in there for-EVER and when they finally opened the door, an enormous amount of pot smoke was rolling out into the main area. Ummmm...believe it or not, it's not funny to hotbox a public bathroom and some people don't actually want a contact high, jackasses.  It was absolutely disgusting having to use that bathroom afterwards. Not to mention, the bathroom there is almost always very dirty, toilet paper everywhere, and everything is always wet. It's gross. I know that Crescent can't control what its customers do, but I hope that they are making plans to add another bathroom or porta-potties or have a way for everyone to use the restrooms in the stage area, or SOMETHING because it really is my only complaint about Crescent Ballroom."
20018,0,Worst Sprint store in town. Their staff are theives and the managers cover up for them. I'm currently disputing  fraudulent charges from this store. No one wants to take responsibility and I'm out 500$ \n\nHorrible customer service and untrained staff. \n\nI proved one of their sales people stole from me and threw manager did nothing!\n\nI'm also reporting this store to the BBB.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!
29352,2,Nothing wrong here.  It's more elegant than a typical Mexican restaurant.  I found the food perfectly edible and hits the spot when I have a craving for Mexican but I save 4 and 5 star reviews for Mexican restaurants when they are truly a cut above.  Usually the best Mexican food is found on plastic plates in divey locations.\n\nGo here for perfectly good Mexican food but you won't be blown away.  Also I didn't like their margaritas.
20902,2,"My return visit to Rachel's Kitchen! I arrived just around 11:20 AM on a Saturday morning and the place was bustling, although not overly packed. The outside dining area had pretty much every table full of Summerlin moms and a scattering of elderly people and young people enjoying brunch or just coffee outside in the nice weather. I believe Rachel's Kitchen attracts quite a wide range of people.\n\nI ordered the Breakfast Burrito and asked for bacon to be put it in it. The service was very nice and the cashier was pleasant. I quickly retreated outside to find a place to sit and found a partially-shaded table that was perfect. \n\nThe food came out quick. I thought the burrito was very generous with its fillings. There was a lot of eggs, very well cooked, and a good amount of bacon. The pico de gallo inside was not over-powering (especially for someone like me, who HATES cilantro). However, my same complaint as before - I saw avocado on the ingredients list and I was over-joyed with happiness - BUT the burrito was somewhat lacking in my expectation of avocado goodness. Perhaps I have learned my lesson and will order EXTRA avocado from here on out. The burrito also came with little potatoes and ketchup to dip them in. I only had a few, because the burrito was very large, in fact - I didn't finish it!\n\nRachel's Kitchen is great for an outdoor brunch. I do like it, but again it is in The District and if you can deal with a little bit of the snooty customers who inhabit this particular shopping center, than you will be fine. I will only subject myself to it when I truly need to go out of my way - as is the case with grabbing a bite to eat at Rachel's Kitchen."
12347,1,"I'm afraid this place has gotten rather long in the tooth. There are better places to stay for the same rates. I got the sense that New York New York has been a little neglected. It's nothing that can't be fixed with a nice remodel but I wasn't impressed. \nMy room was on the small side, which isn't a big deal because I didn't spend much time there. I was mainly there to sleep but little things left me with the sense that there was some wear and tear that needs to be fixed. First off, my bed was sagging a little in the middle. Not to mention the sheets and towels seemed a bit worn. In the bathroom, there was a large scratch on the mirror that didn't obstruck the view but just left me with a sense that I was in a second class hotel. Also one of the curtain rods was broken in half.\nWhen I was sleeping, I could hear folks in the hallway which isn't a big deal but it added to the impression that I could have done better."
5998,0,"I just called over to this practice to try to get a new patient appointment.  Be warned that if you are looking for an appointment that is working-person friendly (saturdays, first thing in the morning or in the late afternoons) you are looking at a long wait.  I was willing to wait 4-6 weeks to get this type of appointment, but they did not have anything that worked with a working person's schedule for seemingly the rest of the year.  The receptionist sounded relieved when I said I was going to call around to other practices to try to get something for this year.  \n\nI would have appreciated a little more flexibility and ended up calling another dentist in Squirrel Hill who was able to get me into a working friendly appointment for this month."
39984,0,"This is more than a yogurt bar. They've got burgers and apparently waffles. The air was heavy with oil when I walked in.\nI like to try several favors when I visit a yogurt bar. My first attempt was the mango sorbet. When I pulled the trigger a bunch of thick liquid globbed out. We asked about the sugar free \""dairy free\"" vanilla and the cashier proceeded to tell us it's not really dairy free. \nThe flavors of my selection were disappointing.\nThis was the worst yogurt bar experience I've had."
15526,4,"small? yes. worth going to? hail yes. this is the only cool bar i went to in Vegas. plus, my local friend comes there all the time for drinks and good music. so i trust her taste. the music is always good (top 40- hiphop/reggae/reggaeton/etc), they're playing a movie on their screens, comfy areas to sit and mingle with friends or strangers. not much dancing room, but it's more like a lounge/bar. oh yeah... no COVER! i love it."
49499,3,"I heard so much about this place, and I've been wanted to try... \n\nFood: it is tapas style, or in Japanese izakaya style.  Each portion is small so it will be good if you order about two dishes per person to share with the group.  Everything we ordered was very good, great flavor, nicely presented. Looked yummy and tasted yummy too.\n\nDates wrapped in bacon: I like the sauce on the dish. Dates and bacon are interesting mix but this sauce nicely mixed together.\n\nSuzuki roll: I liked the smell and taste of slightly deep fried? rice around the roll.\nMaya roll: Double spicy (spicy tuna and spicy sauce (I think it was wasabi base sauce).  Nonetheless, liked the flavor.\nKimuchi fried rice: tasted better than the one I make at home. Smelled the kimuchi but it wasn't overwhelming at all.   Sometimes kimuchi could be strong, but I think the sauce on the dish toned it down to the level the kimuchi was enjoyable.\nChinese Chicken salad: nothing fancy...\nWe shared three deserts and all were good. \n\nThis place said Mexican Asian fusion but the way they used difference sauce reminded me of French food.  I think they used French dressing for Chinese Chicken salad\nNice decor inside, mix of Mexican and Asian. I didn't necessarily loved it but it was certainly interesting for sure.\n\nService: although it was good but very slow... We were there for lunch and ended up being there for two hours. So if you are in a rush, this place is not good for you. Go there only if you want to enjoy the fun atmosphere with a group of friends to enjoy conversation.\n\nFood was so interesting, I want to come back and try all the rest when I have more time. I like French, Mexican and Asian in general. When combined, it is perfect of all."
29090,4,"I love me some Cracked Egg I'll tell you what. \n\nCoffee cake alone is enough reason to come here. It's light, fluffy, warm, steamy, sweet, and they're constantly updating the flavors like a pumpkin one in the fall or the berry one I had last. \n\nMy favorite things to order for an entree are the scrambles, particularly the South Shore with chicken and avocado. Their corned beef hash is scrumptious and tasty as well.\n\nTried soup and salad also, portions are HUGE. Great place to brunch."
13976,2,"I've been to a number of steakhouses in Las Vegas and none of them stand out - for the food. This place stood out for two things. First, the water show. Second, the prices. I have no qualms with paying exorbitant prices for outstanding food. I have a slight problem paying exorbitant prices for marginal food. This is marginal food.\n\nThe steaks were about as good as you can find at any other steakhouse. Some of the sides, appetizers and salads were above average. I think when you're spending $100+ per plate on dinner, it ought to be off the hook good. Not so at SW Steakhouse.\n\nSlightly upturned face."
17040,0,"I wonder how much worse things are in Hell. \n\nAfter all, riding The Duece doesn't seem much better. \n\nIf you know your slanguage, \""Duece\"" couldn't be a more appropriate name. Riding this bus can be a pretty shitty experience. \n1. It's riddiculously uncomfortable. True the seats have a soft plush cover, but look at the way they're organized and proportioned, they don't give you a lot of leg room, or arm room for that matter. Whoever designed the bus interior should be thrown in front of a bus. \n2. They get riddiculously crowded. Considering there's so many of them running at once, they really need to put a limit on how many people can be allowed on the bus at once, it's truly riddiculous how cramped that bus can get, the seating organization doesn't help either.\n3. At every stop, even if there aren't any people there, the bus stops and waits for about 5 minutes. What the hell are you waiting for? If someone wasn't at the bus stop in time, that's their fault, besides, there's probably another Duece right behind you, and it's not like the bus has anymore space to pick up more passengers anyway.\n4. The bus drives at tour bus speed. Considering that it's the only bus on the Strip, locals and workers have to use this bus as well, they have more important destinations to get to at certain times, while these tourists are on vacation and have all the time to do whatever the hell they want. If a local is late for their job or an appointment because of how slow this bus is going, that's just downright unfair, and the driver should be sued. Even when Strip traffic is at it's worst, driving from the Flamingo to the Venetian shouldn't take anymore than 10 minutes. 15 tops. Not almost 30. And any attempts to make this a sight seeing/tour bus is borderline futile, considering that most of these buses have screen coating ads which makes everything outside look all fuzzy and distorted. \n\nHere's some suggestions:\n1. Do a complete remodel of the bus interiors, so the seat organization is actually functional. \n2. If all the seats are filled, no more than 20 people should be allowed on the bus at a time. \n3. You know what, scratch all that. Keep the Duece Bus exactly the same for the TOURISTS. How about adding a route of regular buses for the Strip that locals and workers can use, with designated stops for the Deuce and the regular CAT bus so everyone will be able to tell the difference. These buses will run at normal speed so people who have more important places to go will get there on time, since there's no tourists, there will be no epic crowds of people standing on top of each other and you'll have to pay regular fare of $2.50 for a day pass, not $5.00, which is the type of money tourists have to blow, not everyday people. \n\nI'm actually not surprised that so many people think there is nothing else to Las Vegas besides the Strip. I mean, after they see how things like The Duece work, obviously it seems totally unreasonable for people to actually thrive here."
20272,1,Not sure why this place gets such great reviews. The service was good but the food just ok and the location/atmosphere ok.\nI found the price very expensive as well.\nNot worth it.
34020,4,"With severe intestinal inflammation and after seeing another GI specialist who spent all of 5 minutes with me before trying to sell me on an (unnecessary) endoscopy i thankfully found Dr. Weisz.  He spent over a 1/2 hour doing a detailed examination and interview, determined that an endoscopy or even a CT scan was not necessary at this point, gave me a dietary regime to ease my symptoms and scheduled follow-up with me.  And, I saw those earlier comments about his staff - I found his staff both in person and over the phone to be excellent, courteous, and professional.  All around a great experience!"
2118,4,"Great service every time. Always seem to have what we need. Today I took in 5 watches. Normally I go to another place for watch batteries that might be a little cheaper, but lately I was having trouble getting there before closing time. This place is open til 8pm on weekdays and 7pm on Saturdays!  Even 10-5pm on Sundays!!  This is great news."
18916,0,"Rude staff. They don't turn anyone away, but then rush people through and provide substandard service. I was not happy with the manicure but when I expressed this to the owner, she just argued back, wanted to charge me again to fix the paint, and was terribly rude. Given, that there are nail salons in every strip mall, no need to put up with rudeness or sloppiness that happens here."
38014,3,"The $22 prix fixe lunch is their loss leader -- go here, try their stuff, like their stuff, come back later for a pricey dinner.  Example: The lamb chops, which you can get for a $10 supplement at lunch, are on their dinner menu for $58.  I assume you get more lamb chops at dinner (...I hope you get more lamb chops at dinner) but why not give them a try at lunch first?  \n\nNote: The drinks menu is not discounted at lunch.  My husband had a $22 lunch and a $16 mixed drink.  So it goes.  \n\nBut overall, we were pleased.  Thumbs up."
37384,4,"In Pittsburgh there's a ton of pizza places, but Papa D's is by FAR the best. The drinks are cheap and the food is awesome. I would willingly sell my left arm for their famous tomato anchovy apple pie with a scoop of homemade limoncello ice cream. If you've never had it before, you're not a true yinzer. And there's this one bartender named Angie (or Angela?) that  makes my drinks strong, and speaks absolutely immaculate Korean.  Seriously, go in just to have a conversation with her in Korean, she loves it. Highly recommended!"
36057,1,"As a proud black male with an education, let me tell you that I've had better Greek food. I awoke from my midday nap with obvious hunger in my belly, and I was craving something from the land---you know, made with vegetables and animals grazing on hillsides, like the pictures I've seen in books. \nAnyway, I headed down to Pastitsio for a gyro ($8, with a \""salad\""). The gyro perfection was indeed perfect, but the side salad was weak and sloppy wet with a flavorless oil sauce, like my Uncle Red's toupee they found after Katrina hit town.\nThe gyro was definitely flavorful, and not obscenely enormous like some places make them (Rodos Greek Cafe). But the salad was so bad, I knew I need to get home and Yelp to all my homies in the L-Ville. \nService was fine and average, no complaints. And the atmosphere is hip metal tables, exposed brick, and yuppie hipster prices. There was a lovey-dovey couple next to me romantically sharing some rice pudding(also overpriced). \nMy main gripe is that I don't feel I got $8 of gyro and salad--it shoulda been $5. And the menu had too many options. \nI'm a simple man, as you can tell by my picture. Cheap Greek food should be CHEAP.\nNow, back to whoopin some ass..."
33801,1,I just moved over in this area and was trying out different salons. I needed a gel pedicure so i stopped here.  The salon was not as clean as you would liked and they got their tools from a toolbox. Nothing seems to be santized. When doing the pedicure they do not massage your feet. And the gels are so so.  I had a french tip painted on with the gels and I could of done a better job.\n\nWill go try another salon after that.
6105,3,"Look this is simple. The name of the place is \""Roadhouse\"" as in peanuts in a bucket on the table, throw your shells on the floor, young waiters and waitresses dancing, and STEAK!   If you want a great steak or great chicken at a very reasonable price in a simple laid back ROADHOUSE style establishment then this is great.  This is not fine dining.  Sorry no special separate booths or perfect fitting baby seats or quiet whisper dining w a waiter that is wearing a white apron.  Give me a break.  Simple..... you want great steak at low prices in a simple place then this isn't a bad choice.....you want to cry about booths and baby slings and loud kids, ummm stay home."
8155,1,"Meh.... we stopped here after arriving here at 11pm and just stopped here because it was the first place we saw that was open.  This place is definitely trying too hard for the cool and hip clubbing sushi place and it definitely had the loudest music of any place I've been to in that genre.  \n\nBut anyways, the food was decent, and it satisfied the Lady's uni craving.  Geez I need to find a source for those uni blocks...."
579,2,"Busy and confusing. It's a nice and large open space filled with many escalators and walking escalators. The people are friendly and do try their best to help. Every terminal/section has a special desk where people who have missed their flights can go to rebook and/or get on standby flights. Unfortunately, the customer service desks cannot handle situations where there is a large number of people who need help. The lines can get absolutely ridiculous!! \n\nOverall, a relatively comfortable area (for an airport) with plenty of food options."
36392,1,"You think it's cheap right off the bat but then you start realizing all the hidden fees. After all the fees, it ended up being more than it would have been to take Southwest. \n\nSuggestion: If you can sit or sleep anywhere, go for it. If you want to get cozy with your neighbor, this is your chance. The seats DO NOT recline. If you can handle those, fly spirit! However, I always tell my friends this is a just fine airline but not if the trip is over 2.5 hours away. The shorter the flight, the more manageable it is to sit on the plane."
4112,3,Huge selection of beers.. Ambiance is also great.. food is awesome....try the chicken nachos...just awesome !
33415,4,"Well - my love for the Irish at this little Jamo joint just grows stronger all the time. \n\nI recently had occasion to host a private party at RFPH for my dear friend Sam and naturally my home away from home was the best place to play hostess. I had the benefit of still feeling as much at ease as I would have in my real home, without having to cook or clean up after the party. \n\nI worked closely with Anne Marie who made sure every detail of the party was attended to flawlessly. We held our birthday extravaganza in the front \""cottage\"" area, which is the perfect spot for about 25-30 guests for a sit down dinner or a happy hour (done that one too). The pub also has a banquet room and separate bar out back which can be rented out for private functions. Another one of my friends held her wedding reception here and, in addition to having the great food and service you'd hope for at your wedding, it was just plain fun. \n\nBack to our Sunday birthday brunch... The kitchen prepared an Irish breakfast as well as a course of passed hor d'oeuvres of cucumber sandwiches, filet mignon brioche (my favorite) and salmon mousse toasts. For dessert I was able to bring in special cake for the party and the kitchen added an accompaniment of fresh strawberries and creme (brilliant). Everything came out well timed and executed start to finish. \n\nLucky for us, Sunday afternoons now offer live jazz - which was a great bonus for the party atmosphere. I don't know if we should still be calling it a brunch - those usually don't last for 9 hours... but we had a great time."
14723,2,"When I got to this place I was super stoked, the ambiance was amazing, service for sure is excellent. Food ? Outback is better not worth 100 buckaroos  per plate :) hey but I heard brunch is really good here I'll try it sometime:)"
35400,3,"Love this little place! Really friendly and cozy environment, lovely home-made food, and milkshakes! I split a panini and wrap with my friend (can't remember which ones) and they were both delicious and came with nice side-salads. Service was quick and easy and they have yummy home-made desserts."
3155,1,"Went to Flancers the first time this last week.  I got the Prickly Pear Caesar Chicken.  I was not a fan.  The dressing didn't taste much like Caesar and while the Prickly Pear flavoring was tasty, it seemed odd for a Caesar.  I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.\n\nMy biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.  I'd visit one more time if I could have a Stella w/ my meal, but with the lager selection, I can scratch them off my list."
24274,1,"Meh.... \n\nLet's start with the positives:  Our server was friendly and awesome.  The cornbread served in the cast iron pan was rustic and fresh (piping hot from the oven).  The food presentation was pretty and appealing.  The ambience was rustic, but the place was bustling -- but I went on Black Friday.  It probably isn't usually this crazy.  The prices are middle of the road.\n\nThe negatives:  Too bad the food did not taste as good as it looked.  Everything seemed to need some salt and they used the same slaw in the ahi bites appetizer as in the fish tacos I ordered.  This homogenous taste experience left much to be desired.  Why they serve fish tacos rolled in a gummy flour tortilla is a mystery.  If you are going to serve a rolled taco, it better be a fresh corn tortilla.  The gummy flour tortilla stuck to my teeth and top of my mouth.   I ate 2 pieces this way and eventually just took my fork and gutted the two remaining pieces and the experience was much better.\n\nI guess I am used to real Mexican food and enjoy good Cali-Mex and Tex-Mex.  However, this place would not qualify as good in my book.  I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.\n\nMy sister chose this restaurant.  I definitely will not return on my own volition."
33417,2,"Pretty average as usual for this place. The bread and veggies are always fresh and since I never get their substandard meat products, this is all I know about Jimmy John. I will say that they crunchy BBQ potato chips were clearly the best part of the sandwich. Avocado spread is an interesting invention, but maybe Jimmy can afford some real avocado's in the future?"
11408,0,"If i could give zero stars i would. Without a doubt the WORST run casino in Las Vegas, and every single department. The employees DO NOT KNOW what they are doing. Years ago it was THE place to play. Now they can close up and i wouldnt miss it at all. The ONLY nice person working there and willing to help when you have a complaint is Dan Long, director of Player Development. He made good on a major complaint i had there and then lo and behold their incompetent staff managed to ruin that. I have never met such an incompetent bunch of employees and somenof them are downright nasty too."
25140,3,"Took my other half here last week to celebrate his birthday. Nice, cozy spot.. Service was great. He checked on us constantly making sure everything was great. I ordered the Bolognese. It was a little bland. My boyfriend ordered the FRUTTI DI MARE and it was uh-mazing!! It was so delicious that I kept stealing the shrimps from his plate! Lol. The dessert was absolutely divine. We chose the Gelato with espresso on top and it was a hit! We really enjoyed the food and service we received at this place."
18860,2,"The Tavern is typically the place that i would want to see DIAF, but in this case, its dankness kind of works.  Granted, I treat this place like the \""Titty Twister\"" in From Dusk Til Dawn, and bail before sundown so as not to get devoured by the ASU dweebs or the kickball bufties lest I become part of their Lost Boys Chav Cru.  However, they have a pretty dope patio (because more and more, its about the smoking than the drinking, *sigh*), on point servers, modestly priced beer, and good tellies.\n\nAlso, for a place that seems like would serve muledick in a tortilla and try to pass it off as beef brisket, they have a surprisingly tasty menu."
48497,4,Great service and a cool setup! Cool employees and friendly.  Prices are great!  Great selection of eliquid.
10222,4,"Heavenly!!!\n\nI was there last weekend and once again it was amazing. Wynn by is one of my favorite place to stay at in Vegas (Bellagio is the other). The staff is amazing, the hotel is amazing, the service is amazing, the food is amazing and the gambling is great. \n\nThank You"
11244,1,"This place should be rename Yuck E Cheese!  Do they ever clean in here?  Ever time I have gone this place has had half eaten pizzas on the ride or in between the games. I only come here  because my kids of course love it. On our last visit, we were solo lucky to bring home a souviner of pink eye!  Despite the hand washing, one of my kids always gets sick and then it gets passed around our home. The coupons of the past were much better then they are today so it isn't as good of a value. I will praise them for keeping the games at one token, most arcades charge two or more coins per play so they get one star for that."
15424,3,"I was so excited to try this place. The food was excellent. I had the organic chicken w/ thin green beans. My husband and I split the mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. The chicken was good, a little salty for my liking but very good. The green beans were very tasty. My favorite thing however was the mashed potatoes and the mac n cheese. OMG it was good and as I write this review my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Our server was attentive but a little annoyed when I said I only wanted water to drink and we weren't interested in a appetizer. All in all a good dining experience. I would definitely go back next time I am in Vegas."
32962,3,"I have had a great first time experience with this dealership. This is also my first BMW after trading in a very tired, but mostly reliable Ford Explorer '06 for a brand new 328i. I would have considered a new Explorer, but both Ford of North Scottsdale and Camelback Ford's service departments were far from stellar and outright unprofessional on several occasions over the seven years I drove the car.  Bottom line, I have been impressed and satisfied with the service and professionalism of both Chapman BMW locations and I am loving every minute in my BMW. Thanks to John Stanley for your prompt return to my inquiry about a trade in and for your time. The Chicago connection was a plus."
39269,3,"The angry mushrooms were awesome, crab cakes were some of the best I've had in a while.  I didn't have any problems with the waitress, but the ladies in my party were not happy with the service.  Good food, good music...I'd go back for sure."
20687,2,"When TRUMP comes into mind, I think of over the top, great service, and absolute perfection. I was wrong! I've experienced better. First the Pros - non-smoking, the staff was friendly and courteous, great view of the strip from our room, rooms are setup nicely. Cons- when you walk into the lobby, we checked in around 7:30pm, the live band was blasting away and you can barely hear yourself and your yelling at the front desk clerk while checking in. VERY ANNOYING!! The furniture is dusty, coffee maker is dirty and hasn't been cleaned. When house keeping cleaned the room, they didn't replace the coffee or even refill the kleenex in the bathroom, and had to call to get a refill (had to wait on hold before speaking with someone when calling the front desk). Now if I'm at a hotel all I want is convenience, since this is a service industry, having to deal with slow service is unacceptable. The TRUMP hotel is nice, but they need to polish up. I wouldn't recommend this to my friends unless they don't care about the small details."
14515,4,"Best use of a dollar in Vegas. \n\nThese machines are set up to play for fun, unlike so many that I grew up playing.  The magnets are set to keep you playing, and almost every game gives you the full five ball run.  Replay games are at an attainable level, and it is clear to me the owner loves the game and wants more people to love it too.\n\nWhen I go to Vegas I always take time away from all the flashing lights to go look at more flashing lights!  This place lets me touch real quarters too!  The drive off strip helps keep this place from getting too busy, so it is always a great experience,  When you can not only see some of the rarest games from the past and present but play them you know you have a winner.\n\nIf you grew up playing pinball you will have a hard time spending twenty bucks here. You can play one game for a long time if you are a pinball wizard.  If you have kids this is a safe venue to bring them, and they have good popcorn for a quarter.\n\nIf a machine is not working quite right, the staff seems like they want to know.  All of the machines are in such great shape it amazes me. These are not tired old cast off machines.\n\nMachines from the 40's can be played here.  My favorite is the Circus game that was built in a cabinet that looks like a pac man machine - but it is a pinball machine.  It is one of only two ever made!  Many of the machines have an historical slant that most collectors would keep away from the public.  The Circus is the highest priced machine there at one dollar a play - everything else is priced low and even the new machines like Iron Man allow you to buy multiple games for less than the one game price. ( One game 75 cents, 3 plays for $2)\n\nGo have some real fun to add to your reel fun!"
40828,3,I had seen the signs up as I went by for a while not knowing it was an already established owner.  Then I saw Daren's review and decided to try the place.  It is sort of tucked in behind the pizza place which occupies most of the building.  The business name does not fully describe the wide variety of stuff available on the menu.\n\nI arrived a few minutes early and the doors were wide open and everything was ready for business.  The counter person/server was very friendly.  I got the chicken Caesar pita sandwich with a salad and soda fountain.  Service is fast casual where you order at the counter and they bring it to you.  The restaurant is bright and airy and clean.  It was a lovely fall day outside so I chose to sit on the shaded patio.  I am going to nitpik a little because I cannot find much to fault; the Caesar dressing was a bit too vinegary for my taste and I would prefer more Feta on my salad.  \n\nI'll definitely be back to try some more stuff on the menu.
6092,1,decent at best.  if you know real cajun this place won't impress you but for the lack of any other option it's passable.  the Rat Toes appetizer is pretty good.
43063,4,"It's a great place to come and get your hair done very down to earth, I love it you must come and check it out!"
11084,2,"I must admit Hawaiian food is a great way to end a shenanigan-filled weekend in Vegas. Hearty and full of carbs and protein, it pretty much could be a soupless alternative to pho as a hangover helper.\n\nI ordered the Pork Lau Lau since I've been craving it for the longest time. It comes with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. The pork came out tender and the taro leaves were nice and soft. Not bad for Vegas.\n\nIt's in a random strip mall next to UNLV, prices are pretty affordable for what you get. People keep mentioning the Adobe Fried Rice Omelette? Guess I'll have to try that next time I'm in Vegas. And knowing me, I'll be back sooner than later...\n\nP.S. I remember seeing a banner for a student special too if you still have that Student ID of yours!"
16402,4,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  The fried green tomato BLT sandwich with pimento cheese is divine.  It goes great with the pomme frites and a trio of aioli sauces for dipping.  The calamari is also terrific.  It is lightly breaded and cooked to perfection with this amazing Asian Love Sauce.
232,0,"This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza, and my friend got an Italian hoagie. \n\nOne slice of this pizza, and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay, but the pizza...oh, the horror of the pizza. \n\nAvoid."
36229,2,Only 8 lanes and they are over priced.\nHate the concept of reserving lanes.\nDecent music and crowd.
3373,2,"Bought by corporate Landry's (and the Camelback location closed) this former steak giant is headed south, and fast.\n\nWhat do you think about when you think, \""Morton's\""?\n--strangely tan vinyl booths (yes, I've seen them in Chicago, and I finally get it)\n--sinatra standards\n--bow ties\n--to be shown what a beefsteak tomato looks like (from the cart)\n--to be shown what a life lobster looks like (the poor kiddo)\n--to be shown what a porterhouse looks like (oh, YUM)\n--crabcakes\n--AND THE BEST DARNed steak you can get in town, _no matter the cut_\n--don't forget the sprigs of watercress, my favorite.\n\nBut Landry's isn't having it. A multi-million dollar brand is taking a new direction:\n#no more Sinatra\n#no more cart\n#maitre'd has no tux\n#limited Champagne options; $160 Tatt is a plain ripoff.\n\nSteakhouses are a dime-a-dozen these days and with Eddie V's nearby putting on the Ritz with live jazz and magnums of the Heitz Martha's Vineyard _besides great steaks_, Landry's Morton's won't be here for long."
17218,2,"Eh-ish. \n\nI will say this - most of their food was good, but in my opinion, it was very overpriced for a reason unknown to me. I think sometimes it's because it's closer to the strip?? We paid almost $200. That's a lot of money in my opinion. I have a hard time with it because I can get just as good Indian food in a 100% comparable location nearby.\n\nWe came here on Friday night with some friends. We had 4 dishes, 2 appetizers and 5 drinks total. \n\nWe had  -\n\n3 beers\n1 wine\n1 Martini\nStuffed mushroom - Very weird for me. It was a very blunt taste of curry, yogurt and a uncooked mushroom that was breaded.\nSaag Paneer - Very good\nShrimp Tikka Masala - Sauce was very tasty and rich. \nLamb Rogan Josh - The sauce was okay. I felt they used a little too much curry and it over powered the dish with that and nutmeg.\nChicken Mukhani - We actually don't think this was the right dish. It came out and the sauce didn't taste like it normally would for chicken mukhani. It was a bit thinner and not thick like butter chicken typically is. \nLamb Vindaloo - good flavor, nice and tender meat. \n\nOverall - the service was not good. It took us over an hour to get all of our food. Mainly because the waiter was not coming around to ask if we were ready to order. It was not busy, maybe 5-6 tables total. On Friday nights at 7, it's packed at a lot of places. So, that could be a sign if they're not busy. \nAgain, the food was good - not amazing for a pricier menu. The location and the building itself does not call for higher prices. Neither does the service."
22354,2,"I stayed at Palazzo on 1-4-13 to 1-8-13.  \n\nThe hotel was clean and pretty.  Checkins was fast and efficient where the staff was nice and friendly.  \nThe room was spacious but it need a little more work catching up to the Wynn & Encore.  It is not as clean as Wynn nor was the the staff was as friendly. Trust me, i would rather stayed at the Wynn any day  The decor and ambiance at Wynn is a lot better."
17809,1,"We used to really like this place as a good first stop in Vegas.  It has gone downhill - nearly all the way down hill.\n\nIt took 27 - yes, 27 - minutes for our waiter to come say hello and just take our drink order.  At that point, we ordered everything and asked for the check at the same time so we could make sure we didn't miss him again.\n\nThey've narrowed the menu and the choices aren't as varied, leaving off some things I used to like.\n\nI had the bbq chicken flatbread.  The chicken was not only all dark meat, but half of it was inedible because it was all fat and tendons.  I guess if you order a burger it might be ok, but they didn't do this one well.\n\nThis place has a management issue, which causes a staffing issue, which causes poor customer service and wait times.  We won't go back, but hopefully they fix it for future crowds.\n\nOne star for great beer selection, though!"
13254,2,"Pretty cool.  I shot my first gun here.  I won't lie... I was scared shitless, while my friends laughed.\n\nI shot a handgun (took me by surprise, holy crap).. and a small machine gun, which seemed more docile, or maybe I was just getting used to it.  The staff were really anal about safety, which is good I guess.  Saves idiots like me from blowing my own head off.  :)\n\nAfter we was done, we headed to dive bar to release all the build up rage & aggression."
17589,0,"BEWARE \n\n-- If you have any kind of special needs or have a special request, DO NOT COME HERE!!\n-- I am sensitive to UV light emissions.  They assured me that it would be no issue changing out to \""regular\"" incandescent bulbs when we made the reservation. When I called back to confirm, the \""engineer\"" had left a message that there are only LED lights so there are no issues.\n-- To my dismay, the room we found not only had LED lights but also lamps in the walls with flourescent lights which does emit UV rays. So I called down to request to have them changed out. The \""engineer\"" responded that would not be possible. HUH?  They can't find 4 regular incandescent bulbs that can easily be purchased anywhere??   \n-- I have found two types of hotels responses to my lighting issue:  Either they are customer-oriented or frankly they don't give a rats-ass.  Red Rock falls under the latter category.\n-- You may think that I'm being too picky. Is it too picky when you have health requirements?  We, as a population, are getting older, and with age comes a myriad of health issues.  And hotels such as Red Rock will find that with such lack of concern where they cannot be bothered with potential health concerns, us folks, who are not in our 20s blooming with health, will not be willing to patronize them.\n-- Frankly, if it wasn't for the fact that we were at the hotel due to a convention and prepaid by the hosting company, we would have left and gone to a much better hotel on the Strip.\n-- Lastly, the enclosed shower smelled AWFUL like an open sewer. Clearly the drain needed cleaning out. It smelled like something died in there. During showers we had to breath through our mouths; it made you gag if you breathed through your nose. Given the total lack of response from their engineer to the prior request, we didn't see the point in trying to get it rectified.\n-- To add insult to injury, for some reason during our last day there (was there 3 nights), housekeeping failed to clean our room whatsoever. It figures....."
19845,0,Waited for 45 minutes for my husband to get his hair cut because he was skipped. When we asked if he was next they said he had one person in front of him when the only other person in the place came in after us. There were five people working and only one cutting hair. The rest stood up at the register. They said it was cause they couldn't figure out their new system. I don't see how it took 4 people to figure it out. We just left. Lost our business.

8913,2,What the Fuddruckersl?!  How do you go charging $1.69 for 4 freakin slices of apple?!  \n\nAnyhow.  \n\nWe went last week to grab my free birthday burger.  Standard fare.  Normal burgers and fries.  But seriously....charging almost $2.00 for 4 freaking apple slices for my infant?!  \n\nNext time I'll just bring my own apple darnit.  \n\nGood burgers and fries.  Keep your stinking apples.
47543,2,"My wife and I (and our one-year old son) decided to finally try out The Journey - after driving past it a few times and hearing that the price was fantastic for the expanse of dishes and sushi.\n\nI feel the need to preface the review by echoing what many of the other reviewers have pointed out.  This is four stars for a buffet restaurant. - judged against all the other buffets I've eaten at in Madison (a goodly number of them, my belly will attest to).  \n\nThe Great:  The prices are pretty amazing.  You get an insane selection of entrees, a hibachi chef to stir fry a custom meal (in the back of the restaurant), freshly made sushi (with the sushi chefs right behind the counter), etc...  So, to be fair - this is graded on a bit of a curve.\n\nThe Meh:  The sushi, as pointed out in other reviews, does tend to be as rice dominant as you would expect at a buffet (and with these prices).  A lot of \""krab\"" used in this sushi, but a few rolls with salmon, tuna, etc... as well.  I wasn't really blown away by anything on the sushi line, but I happily ate everything on my plate.\n\nThe deserts were also standard buffet fare - nothing shocking.  I should have gone with ice cream (they have a wide assortment in a freezer, in little individual cups.  Pretty cool.)\n\nThe ??:  The speaker system in the restaurant was tuned to a Christian radio station - which was confusing on a few levels.  Namely that it wasn't what I'd consider cool ambiance for restaurant dining.  Honestly, it was weird with a beard.\n\nThe Not Good:  The women's room, I was told by my wife, was \""nasty\"".  I didn't visit the men's room, so I'll assume it was as any bathroom can be - a little smelly and maybe a touch dated.\n\nThe Conclusion:  During our meal, we discussed all the restaurants which had occupied the space before them - Damon's east, The Tilted Kilt, and a few others which were gone before their names could stick.  I don't know if I'll go back to The Journey, but for their sake (and the sake of the folks who will really appreciate it), I hope they stick around.  They offer an abundance at a remarkable price."
7256,4,"I wouldn't go so far as to call the place a dive but it is a definite hole in the wall...next to a Circle K on a not so decent stretch of Indian School. Once you get inside though, things change. \n\nEnough of a variety on the menu to satisfy everyone and the prices are very reasonable. I ordered the cold Italian combo as my friend wasn't sure if they still offered half sandwiches (and I didn't have the common sense to ask), and she had the chicken parm. The woman at the counter was busy as hell as it was the middle of lunch hour, juggling the counter orders as well as the incoming phone calls, but she was still very friendly as well as the other younger woman in all black (didn't hurt that she was cute. LOL). Less than $20 for 2 huge sandwiches and 2 \""gallon o' drank\"" sodas.\n\nFor how busy it was there was plenty of seating (at your generic plastic patio furniture) and the food came out quick. Mind you I'm a big guy and this sandwich was as long as my forearm and as big around as my upper arm. The meat on my sandwich was of an ample quantity and quality, and the veggies were nice and fresh, particularly the tomatoes which were at a perfect ripeness, and pepperocinis (3 to a plate, a generous amount as they were quite large and juicy).  Like the other reviewer I could not finish my whole sandwich, the same lady that had taken our order and brought our food came at the most convenient time to offer to wrap it for me. It is now in my fridge awaiting a quick death later on.\n\nNow that I am working near here (less than a block away, natch) I'm glad my friend knew about it and showed me, as I wasn't looking forward to McDonald's every day at lunch and there isn't much else in the neighborhood."
38839,3,"**Summary**\n       - Flavor - I like the cottage potatoes over regular boring hash browns. Steak and eggs quality wise, it's one of the best for under $8.\n       - Value - They have some pretty good food for such a cheap price. The best value is from 10pm to noon the next day where they have the breakfast specials and the $6.50 steak and eggs. The deals during the regular hours aren't bad either.\n**Price**\n       - $6.50 7 oz. steak and eggs\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place for a cheap, yet quality late night or morning meal."

A fair price on the whiskys\n3. Sample at your leisure\n4. Buy (several) bottles to bring home with you\n\nAll the while, enjoy the ambience of this low key and comfortable establishment.  I shared an absolutely lovely evening here with new friends.  I cannot recommend this place enough.\n\nAdmittedly, I did not partake of the food although the prices on the menu looked more than reasonable.  For me, it was all about the malt whisky."
17337,3,My co-workers always talk about this place so I figured to give it a try with a group of friends. I ordered the 1/2 meat lovers skillet with blueberry protein pancakes....it was BOMB! The sweetness of cinnamon and blueberries just went so together with the syrup. The skillet itself was phenomenal. My girlfriend loved her eggs Benedict. I think I just found my Sunday breakfast joint!

10040,3,"An easy little stroll from Excalibur, MGM, New York New York and a few other hotels on the strip.  They have literally EVERYTHING.  \n\nGreat place to do some room stocking when a simple soda or bottle of water is 3 bucks and up in the casino.  I wandered down to grab some beverages and snacks for the stay and was back to my room in no time.  \n\nNice to know there's somewhere you can grab a few things you may have forgotten or didn't think you needed."

34496,3,"Slidin thru is one of the \""staple\"" food trucks in Vegas that I feel everyone should go to at least once. I've been a loyal fan of them for forever. I also love that they have a brick and mortar store. My only regret is that I don't live closer to them anymore. \nOne of the major things you'll like at slidin thru is the vibe and environment. The music is always nice, and usually something you don't expect to hear at a burger joint. It's spacious and well designed. The aesthetics work well together and it's a very pleasant environment to be in. \nThe sliders are all pretty good. There's a vegetarian one that I've never tried because I'm team carnivore all the way. My favorite are the porky which is a pulled pork and jalape\u00f1o and the buffalo soldier which is a buffalo chicken inspired bit. They also have mystery sliders and random daily sliders that come and go so its always worth a shot to check that. \nThe fries in my personal opinion are meh. I've never had em where I like em there's always been something wrong with them so I never even really eat them anymore. \nAnother great experience is with the workers. They are always super friendly, super nice and give you a fist bump when you get your order. Another random aside is that the hats that the workers wear are awesome. It's a black/red/yellow SnapBack with their logo. It's ridiculously awesome and they sold it at the store for awhile. I've actually bought like 4 of them but because everyone loves it and always steals them from me because they just have to have it. Maybe I should just get a punch card with the hats. After the 4th hat your 5th is free lmao. \nBut overall this is a stellar place. Food is good, vibe is good.  If you ever aren't on the north side you can go to the food truck. They're usually at first Friday and strEATS and I know they do private events. They were supposed to open a second location down on trop and ft. apache but that has never come to fruition :("

48505,0,"Came here to eat with my wife, my buddy and his girlfriend while we were out in Phoenix for Dodgers spring training and had the worst experience ever.  The service here is a joke and the food is not that much better. After we were seated it took 20 minutes before we were acknowledge by our waitress. When she came over she started joking that she was on break and no one told her that we had been seated. We saw at least 4 different waiters/waitresses pass us by and they just looked at us. \n\nAfter we placed our order we received our food promptly but everything was mediocre. My steak was lukewarm at best and under seasoned. Would it hurt them to use a little salt and pepper? My wife steak was overcooked. My buddy and his girlfriend disordered steaks and they had better luck. The on ok y good thing was the bread, it was served warm and tasted good."
42996,2,"Atmosphere:  located on the light rail and in Atherton Mills, location is good. Classic warehouse decor.   Has outdoor patio seating.\n\nService:  Just opened, thus, staff is still new - I am sure service will be good.\n\nDrinks:    Beer selection is good.  I ordered well drinks - week pour but fair price. Liquor selection is still to be determined as their bar was not fully stocked yet.\n\nFood: We ordered pizza.  It was cooked well. Crust was good. Unfortunately, it was very bland, not a true Italian pizza restaurant.  We prefer pizza marinara with some Italian spices like oregano, basil or at least some garlic.  We ordered vegetables and meats on our pizza, but the vegetables didn't pack much flavor or crunch.  \n\nThe good news is, this bland style pizza is very popular with children.\n\nPrice:  Pizza pricing is more expensive than local Hawthorne's Pizza."
40194,4,"The most interesting things in life are the pleasantly unexpected and Mandy's is definitely pleasantly unexpected! Located in the back of a clothing store, there is a magical salad making place! We've all seen salads, they come on the side of your plates, in a little bowl, and sometimes it even comes on a square dish which makes you think wow, that's a decent size salad. At Mandy's, you got eat your salad twice! Well at least I do. \n\nIt's been 4 visits to Mandy's so far, there are tables to sit at or you could have it to go, but they are literally the dream saladmakers. I say this because of the amount of fresh ingredients they have, and they are super accommodating when you want to change an ingredient.  So far I haven't been able to deviate away from the Man Salad, but I also thing that it's because I don't come here frequent enough and when I think of Mandy's now that's all I think of. I substitute the bacon for black beans, and like I said, relaxed and smiley staff that don't even think twice about it.\n\nI think the only difficult part for me, is getting here at the right time, I find myself working all over Montreal, so sometimes I will be nearby when it closes or before it opens, but I heard they have delivery for that. \n\nSo YES, get off your butt and go to Mandy's, it's the treasure that's been waiting for you here in Montreal."

There are only two stores in the U.S., so be sure to pay Fornarina a visit while you're in Vegas!"
7156,0,"Beware. They do not practice proper procedures and will end up serving you food melted THROUGH the styrofoam containers. On top of that their customer service will leave you being laughed at and scowled upon, on top of them talking shit because they think you don't know spanish right in front of you.  All when you demand food that does not have cancerous plastic melted into it. A fresh order and an apology is how you handle it. Not sending them back home after a second trip with  cold food and not a difference in how they packaged it . After what my husband saw them doing while cooking the food as he waited, I assure a call to the health department about sanitation and cross contamination.  As regular patrons we will no longer go there. You should seriously reconsider the etiquette of your little taco stand people."
45857,4,"This place is an outstanding find in Las Vegas.  We only found it by accident as we were staying away from the strip because of the Valentines weekend and everyone crowding the whole city.  This place is something you would expect on the strip being high class, but even better because you can actually see the whole view of Las Vegas from your table.  The food was outstanding and unique, not stuffy and now home style, but classy and unique but really good combinations of ingredients.  Just the descriptions of options on the menu and from the waiter made it hard to choose, but we've never been disappointed.  A high class environment but very personal too. Vic, the owner came out and talked to everyone and made us feel at home.  We've been there 3 times (every time we travel through Vegas) and Vic is there and actually remembers us and treats us like family.  We look forward to visiting for the people as much as the food.  It's like family away from home."

Ranch dressing was really good, bleu cheese dressing was really bad. Chicken tenders were burnt, like to the point that when I opened the container, it smelled like a kitchen was on fire. They were so black, I could not believe that they actually delivered those to us. The buffalo sauce was good, but useless since our chicken was not eatible. The baked potato fries were a good concept and had a good flavor, but the fries were soggy, but maybe that was just because they were delivered. Okay, maybe it was less than a 50/50 ratio here, since we did spend over $100 for so much dissapointment."

But this third time was just uuggghh. I try to be an understanding customer and not lash out at waitresses because usually if the food is crap, it's not their fault but I gave these two waitresses my first lashing because they let me sit there and boil for twenty minutes as I waited for them. \n\nThe experience (setting: there were only 5 other occupied tables and no one came in after us):\n1) it was15 minutes after we were seated before we got water. We had to ask for it. Our glasses were never refilled.. Esp since they didn't come by until I called for them.\n2) there were 4 of us. we had to ask for another utensil setting since table only had 3. \n3) food took 10 minutes to partially come out. We had to ask for our miso soup since they forgot or didn't know our lunch came with it. Waitress told us that our two cali rolls would take a little bit. Those did not come out til 30 min later. \n4) food was beyond poor. My teriyaki salmon didn't have a teriyaki glaze. Seemed like it was just deep fried. Hard - overcooked. My dads teriyaki salmon was   still raw in the inside. My moms bulgogi was flavorless and cold and galbi was hard and not marinated. My bfs tofu soup (soondubu) tasted Ok but not traditional flavor or what I'm used to. Wasn't even red. Daeji bulgogi was Ok. Lastly, the Cali roll was ugh. The rice around the roll just didn't taste right. The insides were standard.\n\nI asked if there was a new chef or something and she just responded, we are a bit unorganized today. My parents have been here more than me and said this time was the worst, too, and  we've never had the same waitress... Sooo.. Yeah.\n\nDone with this place."

If they had originally told me 40 minutes, I would have  turned around and come back another day. \n\nI ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict and was so disappointed because eggs benedict is my favorite breakfast item.  The Hollandaise sauce didn't even taste like Hollandaise sauce, in fact it just lacked flavor completely.  I only took a few bites and filled up on the potatoes instead.  My husband ordered the \""Mexican\"" but he could barely taste the carnitas because the jalapenos completely overpowered the dish. \n\nIt it wasn't for the VERY TASTY Red Velvet Pancakes, the friendly staff, and the quick service- this review would have been a 2.  It is also the reason why I am going to give it another chance and order the adobo fried rice or loco moco next time.  Hopefully, my experience will be better and I can update this rating.

Not many and don't give me lip about general lee's fakewich down the street either. If you want the real deal, you got to dig deep. Sandwiches range from 3.25 - 3.75. This place won't break the bank and the sandwiches are a foot long. EAT THAT JARED. No, literally. Eat it, it's good for you. Another amazing thing about them is that you buy 11, they give you the 12th free! SCORE. with 12 different kinds of banh mi and even a vegetarian to boot, who wouldn't want to give this place a shot?

45166,0,"Far from the \""best ever\"". The \""big\"" sandwich (the #2) I ordered was about the size of a hot dog bun. I ordered it \""hot\"" and the bread was warm but the inside was cold. The spicy mustard was not spicy at all. My husband ordered the Reuben and it was hands down the worst Reuben I've ever had. The sauerkraut was mixed with some liquid thousand island and it was runny in a bad way. The meat was tough and tasteless...I actually spit it out. \nIn fairness, the place was clean and the staff was very friendly. I guess I shouldn't have expected more from a place attached to a car wash, but maybe they should change their name to \""just ok\"" and it wouldn't have been such a letdown."

Decent food, decent beer selection, good atmosphere, good staff, dog-friendly, and plenty of peanuts!\n\nThis is a good place to watch games, especially if you get seated on the outside patio.  Bring your dog along and enjoy the game together.  If course, once summer rolls around its going to be pretty unbearable to sit outside, which is probably the best part about this place."

12345,1,"My work has had a sales conference in Vegas every year, and traditionally, my roommate and I get placed in the worst venue each time. Last year, all our friends got but in Mandalay Bay, and we were placed in an unrenovated, dingy tower at Caesars. I think god is trying to punish us for our sins. First of all, I hate Las Vegas and casinos especially. I think all the lights and sounds and masses of people tend to drive me insane. I also found navigating this hotel really confusing. Its like a maze and it took me forever to find the exits. As usual, we checked in and got placed in one of the smoking towers, and the week went pretty much downhill after that. The ambience of the room was similar to a best Western, or maybe Motel 8, and reeked of smoke and stale mold. All that for $140 a nite! Also, there was a shooting here recently which I think adds to its \""hood\"" credibility. The restaurants and bars in this hotel leave much to be desired. There are a lot of fake new york pizza and deli places, and some stands that feature some pretty unappetizing looking \""new york\"" hotdogs. The pool is not the greatest here either....its small, with limited numbers of lawn chairs. Also, the room service at this place sucks. Its slow, and the food is pretty crappy. But hey, I was in Vegas, where I typically drink things that i should not and eat nasty food late at nite, so there were a couple nites i went on eating binges . The lowest point during the week was when I woke up at 8 in the morning in a plate of fried chicken and mac and cheese. I hope to never repeat that again."

Secondly it's pretty cute and the patio has those misters that are ubiquitous in Phoenix. But, the thing that really got my pulse racing was the idea of jalape\u00f1o biscuits and gravy. I've said over and over how I'm always looking for delicious biscuits and gravy and have such a hard time finding them. I thought I may have struck gold with the addition of jalape\u00f1os.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't. The meal was just okay. The thing that made it weird for me was that there was a layer of biscuits, then a layer of cheese, then the gravy which was topped with eggs. I like eggs, but usually on the side. I love cheese, but I really only wanted the gravy on the biscuits. \n\nOh well, each to his or her own.

Said the chicken was being fresh cooked.  Manager finally came by and offered us a free tapas to ease the wait (nice touch).  But when dishes finally arrived, I found about 5 pieces of chicken in my heaping salad that taste wise had been compromised by an over generous drenching of some kind of dressing (sesame oil, I think) that produced more heat than taste.  Wife's wrap was more robust with chicken, but not noticeably fresh cooked.  Overall, a poor experience."

NO VOLUME why even have a tv in the 1st place? \nOMG if you've read my reviews you know that is a deal killer for me. and I'll end up somewhere else. \nWe ordered wings and 2 salads. This must have annoyed this waitress b/c we never saw her again? she spent the ENTIRE time kissing the next table's ass. .and I mean giggling like a teenager at everything this table's patrons had to say, and would by pass us like nothing. \nmy bf finally said I guess my empty glass is invisible?  I figured it must have been. When we finally did get her attn and flagged her down to get the check - her whole tone changed. I guess the high pitched giggly tone and helpful attitude was reserved only for certain tables and ours wasnt up. Maybe we didnt spend enough? \nsorry but I'm only going to order what I'm willing to actually eat. \n\nWINGS: The wings were ok. we ordered HOT and garlic cilantro. The garlic cilantro had ZERO flavor. I was really disappointed b/c I like both A LOT. garlic is up there w/ salt & pepper in my household. The hot good though, but they were very very very VERY greasy. I think i used every napkin in the place. more napkins than BWW or HOOters cant be good in the calorie dept. and the taste wasnt that far above and beyond so IMHO the nxt time I go I'll probably try something else, and maybe get it to go to avoid bad waitressing."
30215,2,"My recommendation: Banana, cheesecake/strawberry\n\nYou really can't go wrong when you're combining flavors here. The chocolate goes well with the banana and it still taste great when you throw a little coconut and strawberry cheesecake in there. Nothing really over powers anything so you can't really make a bad mix so go crazy.\n\nThe lighting is pretty dim so it makes for pretty chill, kickback environment. It's quiet with soft music playing. They play popular/mainstream songs consisting of different genres. \n\nThe metal chairs had back rests that could easily send you to the hospital. They were worn and jagged. I sliced my arm open while gettin out of the chair.\n\nI wasn't blown away by this places frozen yogurt, but I can't complain about the product quality either."
20610,0,"Omg. This place is ghetto heaven. Lol. Asked around about a place that plays hip hop and was told about this place. When I pull up in the parking lot a fight was breaking up. \n\nAt the door I was subject to a wand. I was thinking what has happened here to warrant all this? Inside is dirty as well. everyone cramps into one area close to the DJ booth though there are lots of other areas. \n\nOnly pluses about this place is the nice lady in the bathroom, and the potential this place has if only they would clean it up. \n\nI doubt if every come back here. Upset i wasted $20 I think I stay for about 15 minutes and went elsewhere"
39399,3,I seem to be fond of this place although for a sub it's a little pricier than regular but hey it floats my boat so I am good.\nRight when you walk in the staff welcomes you.. They aren't soggy like other places I have been too. Actually has a little bit of sweetness. Maybe it is because of the wheat. \n\nIf you go I would recommend that you try\nHook and ladder or\nSmoke house beef and cheddar brisket\nPlus the pop machine is amazing you have lots of options for pop.
38588,4,"Holy Cow Batman.  Ya gotta check this place out.  I am on a Thai food kick after 45+ years of avoiding it and this place is one of the best for sure!\n\n1.  Ambiance - Very nice, trendy, modern place good for dates or the family, trendy or casual.  Located on Horizon Ridge and Horizon Ridge in Henderson near the 215.  Easy access and parking.\n\n2.  Service - Pleasant, welcoming, just perfect.\n\n3.  Prices - Extremely reasonable. Not cheap, not expensive, just right.\n\n4.  Food -  What a great experience. We ordered all spice medium as to not get blown out and not be able to really taste the food.  Medium has a great kick to it, but not overpowering.  As they grade from 1-4, we actually ordered 2.5\n\na.  Tom Yum Soup - We ordered a small, just enough to share for two. Tasty, tender chicken, and just right.\n\nb.  Eggplant with Ground Pork - This is my comparison dish.  I order this at every Thai place and here, it was very, very nice. Tender eggplant, succulent ground pork. Could not ask for a better flavor.\n\nc.  Pad Kee Mau - this noodle dish they describe as \""Drunken Noodle\"" what Thai people order after a night of drinking. This is an amazing dish. The wide noodles are the right firmness, the sauce very flavorful, the chicken mean was very tender alsos.\n\nd.  Red Curry Chicken - WOW. You cannot go wrong with this.\n\n\n5.  Dessert - Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango Ice Cream.  Hubba bubba.  I am rolling out of this place now. Call for a tow truck.  I am gonna burst.\n\nDelicious.  GK says, check it out!\nOverall,"
9344,2,"A tradition and must when we visit Vegas! Our 1st stop.  \n\nBut, the CA hotel smells of cigarette smoke all over the place. Being an older hotel, must have an extremely poor ventilation system. It seems like there is no air that circulates. Only thing that recycles is cigarette smoke with cigarette smoke.  I feel like I have pure virgin lungs before stepping into the lobby. When I walk out, I feel like I have black lungs.\n\nOno food though! :)\n\nThen Lappert's afterwards if there's room for more."
49867,4,Tried this place on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The staff was very friendly. The place was pretty full but not so full that we had to wait for a table. Order the pulled pork sandwich and it was great. Food came out quick and the prices are the same as a comparable place. Will be returning.
27665,2,"This isn't great food, it's simply a place you hit up when you are trashed and need to fill your belly with grub so you can sober up."
36083,2,"love the small space and the food is good too.  similar concept to raku on spring mountain.    we started with the crispy spinach.  it lived up to the hype and the peanut dipping sauce is a nice compliment.  we then had the glass noodle salad.  I didn't care for the texture of the noodles and the taste profile was too similar to the peanut dipping sauce.  for an entr\u00e9e we ate the salmon with green curry and avocado.  i'm not a huge salmon or curry fan but the dish was really good.  the curry had a nice spice.  the avocado added nothing to the dish, nor was it very eye appealing.  for dessert we shared the sticky rice with mango.  it wasn't my choice and I really didn't care for it at all.  service was good and the beer was cold."
31876,3,"They now carry a perfectly servicable New Zealand sauvignon blanc, added some mood lighting, have an excellent happy hour menu and have expanded their bruchetta offerings (try the hummus...it's outrageous). Happiness."
3067,1,"Beer is ok.\n\nFood...meh.\n\nAfter watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule.\n\nThe menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.  There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage.\n\nAs for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts.  Overall not a good effort.\n\nSo assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also."
43626,4,"Peridot Sweets made our wedding cake, and coming up on our second anniversary, people are still talking about how beautiful it looked and how delicious it was. Tiffany created a custom cake using out colors and style preference. They also provided a dessert buffet as well.. Our guests loved the shortbread cookies and brownie pops! Thanks Peridot Sweets!"

3906,1,"With reviews ranging from 5 stars to 1...my wife and I decided to give it a try for our 3rd wedding anniversary dinner. Good thing she and I have a sense of humor because we needed it. \n\nFrom the cheesy bad decor, to the awful / skipping CD music and abysmal lighting, we wondered whether the food was so superb that some people chose to ignore the obvious deficits and gave this place a high rating. Uh, no. We were the only ones in the entire restaurant on a Wednesday night. That's right. The only ones and we were there for a couple hours and still the service was lacking. \n\nOn the plus side: They accepted our Restaurant.com discount coupon, which was good considering the other review I read about them choosing not honor one they felt didn't apply. The combination waitress/hostess/manager/(& chef?) also did not charge me for a glass of wine that was way passed its prime and smelled / tasted like vinegar, which again, was good service on their part. But the food was just ok. Not bad. Not superb. Just Ok.  \n\nProbably the most entertaining part of our meal was the suprise we received while eating our dinner. As we listened to the loud Indian music piped over our heads, we were quite suprised to hear the Hindi version of the Fergie's \""My Humps.\"" We actually stopped eating, looked at each other and burst out laughing.  I could just see a lady in a Sari singing about her humps, her humps, her lovely lady lumps...uh, what???\n\nAlso, it seemed like the proprieters were having a family dinner at one of the tables; complete with children doing homework.\n\nWe won't be going back and suggest you try somewhere else."
37377,1,"My wife were in town from Denver and are both Celiacs so finding a place with decent gluten free food is tough while on the road. Vitamin T was one of our few options. Phoenix needs to step it up with GF food offerings. \n\nFirst, the positives: I wasn't expecting much, but the food was actually pretty good. The carne asada and barbacoa tacos were very tasty and weren't heavy and greasy like a lot of Mexican food. \n\nIf it weren't for the service, I would have given Vitamin T 4-5 stars. My wife was here for a conference and we decided eat here on a Saturday. The place was packed with people from the conference and when we walked in they were 20 orders behind. There were four guys working but only one was working his ass off. Another wasn't helping with the orders, one was moving very slow and left while we were waiting, and the third was totally clueless. On top of that, they screwed up our order by giving us flour tortillas (which we can not have), even though we requested corn several times while ordering. \n\nBy the time we got our food, we had waited an hour. If they aren't busy, I would recommend it. Otherwise, just go to Chipotle where they're much more efficient with four people."
17227,2,Food and service were okay. Among the dishes I ate were sweet & sour soup and tofu with baby bok choy.\n\nThe decor seemed fancy. I liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the wood-covered menus.
45001,1,"This is probably the worst massage that I have ever had in my life! It was so bad that it was actually laughable. \n\nThe only reason that they get two stars is because I was here for GNO and they placed the five of us together in our own room. This is the rundown on reflexology: lay on your back, place feet in hot water bucket (mine was room temperature), facial massage, arm massage, front leg massage, foot massage, flip over, lower leg massage, back massage, and shoulder massage. Wear comfy clothes. \n\nMy massage tech was the absolute worst! Lol. If you end up with the taller Asian lady rocking a short bob-- RUN! Throughout the massage I could tell that she was only going through the motions. Her transitions in-between were lazy at best and I could tell she didn't really care how her motions felt for the receiver. When she was using the towel to remove the lotion or wipe my feet dry it felt like she was trying to scrape my skin with its grittiness. I also didn't like that she kept yawning and sighing throughout the service. It's rude. While they were doing the jerking motion of your foot, I felt like she was trying to pull me off of the massage bed and this actually made me start laughing. When she positioned my arm in the attempt to feel my scapula and massage it, wrong. Everything she did was so wrong. I usually fall asleep during massages, but with this one I was definitely wide awake and contemplating the whole time on whether or not to ask her to stop. Haha. \n\nIf I come back, I'm definitely trying someone else. Or Terri R.'s fav person! Happy Feet I missssss you"
35126,2,"Nothing special.  Had their basic burger w fries/sweet potato fries.  It wasn't bad, but nothing makes me really want to go back. If you're in Scottsdale, try Indulge Burger instead."
35551,1,"Despite the raving reviews this place got on Yelp, I can't say that I was impressed with my experience there. \n\nThis afternoon I decided to pop by the Larder and, I must admit, my expectations were high. Inside it was lovely, but nearly empty (hey, more room for me!). However, I was greated by the waitress in a very indifferent manner, I kinda felt as if I was disturbing her cleaning/packaging routine.\n\nThe service was kind of lackadasical but I didn't mind much anticipating great food. Well, that's where I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay (no hairs in it, no dust on it), kind of. It just wasn't great. I had the pumpkin and goatcheese fritata which came with salad on the side. The fritata was ... well, ... bland really. There is no other word for it. The \""salad\"" on the side was dressed with olive oil, that's it. No vinegar, nothing, just olive oil.\n\nThe food wasn't horrible, it was just a severe case of \""I could do this ten times better at home\"". What annoyed me was that the plate looked as if someone had spent a great deal of time thinking of what would look pretty, but forgot to actually taste the food for seasoning and flavour.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't go here again. It's pricey, and the food was bland to me. (Oh, and did I mention that my fritata was only warmed half-way through? The other side was still cold as it had just come out of the fridge!). Eek!\n\nI'd give this a miss, or I just caught them on a really, really bad day!"
12167,1,"Normally I would give this place 4 (or maybe 5) stars as it had a lot of character and the food was good. \n\nHowever we had pretty terrible service. We were sat in a corner and basically forgotten about. While it was super busy, there were 4 servers (and a bartender) on duty. It took 30 minutes before we got a menu, then another 30 or so before we got anything to drink (not even water). In all the meal took 2 hours from when we were seated, which would have been okay if I wasn't thirsty for the first hour. \n\nNot sure I would go back unless it was at an off-time, or if I do go back I'll make sure not to get the same server. The guy was just really disorganized. Did things like bus tables (despite there being 3 clean tables open/no need to take care of such things immediately) instead of refilling drinks/etc. Felt like a bit of a d*ck short tipping the guy, but the service really was that bad/I was worried it'd take a half hour to get my credit card or change back so I did the best I could."
46290,0,"Not happy at all! They have a frequent user program that they screw you on because they can't keep track of how many times you've been there & refuse to give you a print-out or card to prove your visits. They've screwed my friend over two different times & refuse to correct it even though we are only talking about a few $'s. The service is slow as all get out. Took over 2 hrs to get a full set of nails put on. Don't go there. They lost 2 good customers today & they could care less! It's okay, there's nail salons all over the place."
39759,4,"I think it's fair to say that Spanish cuisine hasn't caught on in the UK in the way that, say, French or Italian has. We're all au fait with authentic coq au vin and insist on our pasta being al dente, but, despite tv chefs throwing chorizo into every second dish, how many of us really know what Spanish food is all about? Tapas and sangria might be holiday staples but when looking for somewhere for dinner Spanish doesn't seem to be the first thing that springs to mind. \n\nEl Quijote has changed all that, and in doing so has leaped right to the top of my list of favourite places.\n\nIt's small and cosy, with a sort of rustic d\u00e9cor that doesn't overdo it but still manages to feel welcoming and snug. I'm glad we booked ahead as it was full and they were turning people away. The staff are friendly but not overbearing, and the menu is just extensive enough to require some tough decisions but not to leave you languishing in the slough of menu despond. \n\nAnd the food, of course. Man. That was some of the best grilled meat I've had in ages. We started with some simple tapas: the obligatory chorizo and manchego, and some piquant grilled peppers, to go with the complimentary bread and olive oil. Then onto the main courses. My grilled Iberian pork was incredible (see photo). Tender and pink on the inside, with that nice grilled outside, little bits of crisp and crunch, just heavenly. And the simple accompaniment of potatoes and salad was all that was needed. \n\nI didn't particularly like the wine I chose, so I made up for it by finishing the meal with some unctuously rich sherry from their short sherry menu. Much better than having pudding. The next day I was dreaming of that grilled pork and we'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu."
44257,4,"This place is great! The garlic knots and the Penne A La Vodka pasta was terrific, and the pizza was delicious and very NYC style. Definitely will go back! Normally I only come on here to put up any crappy service I get but I had to put how great it was. I Recommend this place"
35168,1,So I usually love coming in here and grabbing a smoothie togo but today I decide to have something to eat. I waited for an hr for my food. If I knew it was going to take this long I would of never ordered anything to eat. I doubt I would have mind if I came in here with someone but I just got off work.
39361,4,"Not Montreal's only cookbook and food lit specialty bookstore, but certainly its best.  A large collection of books in English and French (but mostly English) + a full-service kitchen makes Appetite for Books an ideal location for culinary book launches and cooking classes, and they don't hold back.  Check out their website for a complete list of upcoming events, and act fast if you see something you like--their series of events is very, very popular."
46560,2,Great selection and friendly bartender but lighting and crowd draw leave something to be desired.
27260,2,"Three stars for the Printmakers: it would be more if I was a maker of prints and thus able to tell you more about the equipment, atmosphere, community and sense of creative freedom that I'm sure comes with being a part of this space.\n\nI got to have a look around as part of the 2013 LeithLate event and I'm very glad I went a little way off the Walk to have a look. There are many presses, utensils, papers, inks, slabs of limestone and other accoutrements to get your hands on. The opening gallery space acts as a shop too, with a great selection of works produced just feet away. Upstairs there's another gallery space, with some works coming from further afield when we were there. You also get a great view of everything that's going on in the workshop from up there.\n\nEdinburgh Printmakers is a lovely element of the city's cultural resources and it's great to be able to go home with work that has such a local story behind it."
48765,1,I have ordered pizza from here a couple of times to be delivered. The last pizza I got I ordered the thin and crispy crust. The only thing they got right was the thin. You could not even hold a piece of pizza in your hand because it was so floppy. I will not be ordering from there again. I should have picked up a pizza from Papa Murphy's and baked it myself. It would've tasted better and been a lot cheaper!
15136,4,"I fell in love with the dim lighting and sexy decor while walking by and I vowed I would be back for dinner before we left our weekend stay at the MGM. Well vows are not meant to be broken and this place met all my expectations and then some... \n\nThe service was amazing, loved the bread basket, food was delicious, and the drinks did not disappoint.\n\nI had the mediterranean sea bass and it was simply divine!!! Keep in mind mediterranean sea bass nothing like chilean sea bass which is my favorite of the two... However, they mediterranean sea bass still rocked my taste buds!\n\nMy friend had the roasted chicken and boasted it 5 stars!!! \n\nEverything was perfect at Fiamma Trattoria and this place doesn't deserve anything less than 5 stars!"
39236,3,"I tried Mercurio's gelato two years ago and, more recently, at the Yelp Burgh Bash this past Sept., and I finally had the chance to stop by for dinner last Sat.  Based on my experience with the gelato and what I'd heard from Yelp and elsewhere, I was eager to try Mercurio's savory offerings.\n\nMy dining partner and I shared a house salad (insalata de la casa), as well as a prosciutto pizza.  (Thanks for the great recommendation, fellow Yelpers!)  The house salad consisted of spring greens, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and parmesan dressed with balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and included two pieces of toasted Italian bread.  I found the salad to be quite fresh and flavorful, and large enough for two people to share comfortably.  In terms of flavor, I found the pizza to be quite solid, with the prosciutto being the standout, with just the right amount of smokiness and saltiness.  It also hid a few key shortcomings, such as a sparser-than-preferable amount of cheese, quite effectively.  If you've read my reviews of other pizza places around PGH, you'll know that the aspect of pizza that I tend to be persnickety about is the crispness of the crust. While the crust was light and airy, which was great, it unfortunately lacked the key crispness on the bottom that's essential to a perfect pizza, in my view.  Nevertheless, I was generally pretty satisfied with the quality of the pizza, esp. compared to other wood-fired pizza places around town.\n\nNeedless to say, after finishing the savory portion of our meal, my dining partner and I had to order the gelato, since that's what Mercurio's is best known for.  I had a small, which I split between mint chocolate chunk (my favorite!) and triple chocolate, and my dining partner had a medium, split between chocolate and caramel.  The gelato was just as delectable as I remembered, with satisfying creaminess and flavors.\n\nWhile the ambiance was a bit minimalist, I didn't mind. My one complaint about the layout was that the dining area was quite small and could feel a bit cramped at times.  (At one point, we had to move our table over a bit so that our neighbors could squeeze through.)  I found the service to be a slower than I'd like, but this was probably due to there being only one waitress responsible for serving all of the dining tables.  Even one more waiter probably would have sped things up and reduced the stress on her significantly.  Overall, despite a couple of shortcomings, I had a pleasant experience dining at Mercurio's, and would definitely return."

30111,2,"Great buffet in Vegas.  The best thing about this place is they give you KING crab legs and they steam them up for you hot so you can eat LOTS of delicious crab meat....SO GOOD.  When I went, they gave you a free lobster and a glass of wine for every two dinners purchased, and we didn't even get around to eating the lobsters!!\n\nThey have a good dessert selection (their apple pies were my favorite) and everything else was just OK."

32988,3,"I personally appreciated and loved the medical staff at  Gateway when my 11 year old sister had to utilize the E.R. a couple weeks ago. They were detailed oriented, and very attentive to her needs and ensured she was comfortable and well taken care of while being tended to.\n\nThe rooms were very nice, and the E.R. wasn't a mess like many of my previous experiences to other hospitals E.R.'s.\n\nWhile we were there we made a visit to the Cafe. I've gotta say their food wasn't too bad. The pizza was great and they had a Starbucks to feed my caffeine fix. Take note tho, the vending machines are more expensive than the cafe, so take the few extra steps over there and grab your beverage."

He could have kept the Obama loving comments to himself though cause religion and politics should not be in your repertoire especially given how heated that issue currently is.\n\nI ordered a Hawaii burger  and the wife got their original. Food was done as ordered and was really good burger, but I was not thrilled or overly impressed. I guess with burgers...it takes alot to impress me.\n\nThey had Stone IPA on tap which I appreciated..\n\nAll in all it was a good dinner..would I go back?

22038,3,"Souper Bowl is a stereotypical Pittsburgh bar in every amazing way. Friendly staff, decent beer specials, and good pub grub.  It's become a staple for myself and friends before concerts or Pens games. \nIt can get extremely busy before events, so arrive early. On the plus side, you'll be able to save yourself a few bucks from expensive arena prices.\nAll the food I've had has been good. I like to judge a bar food by their chicken fingers and french fries. Both are delicious. \nIf you want a real Pittsburgh feel this is the place for you! :)"
3719,1,"Take 15 pounds of typical Asian fast food entrees, dump them in a laundry machine with sugar instead of detergent, and serve on a fresh lump of sticky steamed rice.

The guy I seem to always order form always looks like a manic depressive. But hey, if you want calories and it's on the way, go for it."
46630,1,"Oh, Joyride, I really want to like you but I just can't. Maybe I ordered the wrong things. I opted to get the the tamales because they come with the house rice and veggies instead of having to pay extra for sides with the tacos. The tamales were just okay, kind of expensive for what you get, and I have to say I really missed having a side of beans built into the meal with the rice. However, the \""white magic\"" sauce is fantastic. A star for that alone! Maybe other Mexican food places have spoiled me but seriously how much more expensive would it be to included some beans with the meal?? I also got the Jamaica...I mean, Hibiscus drink and it was by far way too sweet. Which was shocking for me because I love sugary sweet things and it was just too much. So much so I didn't even want dessert. I've never said that before. I always want dessert. The house salsa is okay. Not bad but again not great and same goes for the chips. Definitely not what they should be using to draw people into the place. I will say the staff is super friendly and attentive. Maybe too much so. At least 5 different people asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa. It made me wonder exactly who was our server if everyone is checking on us. Nice but odd. Anyway, I promise to try you one more time for the tacos. Fingers crossed it'll be better."
39767,3,"I love Oregano's! The have awesome food and great service. Try the midday rush specials for lunch they have a few super cheap options for the lunch rush!!!

It will knock your socks off in a good way!   \n\n\nI'm disappointed in the change of recipe for the toasted raviolis! PLEASE change it back to the original recipe it was soooooooo much better. I'm still a sucker for cheese so I will order them as an appetizer anyway but I still prefer the old recipe.\n\nTry the Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad it is to die for! SOOOO amazing with the crunchy tortilla strips and the freshly grilled chicken, it a must try!!! But for all the salads I recommend the Jr. size because the normal size is HUGE and the Jr size is still enough for three people to share!\n\nThe Alfredo the dark and the deep dish pizzas are also great!!! \n\n**** DON'T FORGET TO SAVE ROOM FOR THE PIZZA COOKIE!!! stick with the traditional chocolate chip version, I love peanut butter and macadamia nuts but both don't even come close to the amazingness of the original!

The prices were a little steep for the food they gave.  $12 dollar enchilada plates and $10 dinner specials.  \n\nI'd have to say the stand out entree of the night was my plate.  I ordered the MP-1 which was basically a Green Tamale dinner.  It was actually pretty good.  I like the hint of sweetness that is present in the masa.  The beans were decent as well and tasted homemade not canned.\n\nBut there wasn't anything very 'Green' in any of the flavor of the entree.  \n\nOtherwise, everything was pretty standard.  Service was great.  Food came fast.  But all in all, I wasn't knocked off my feet.  \n\nI might possibly give this place another chance.  I really did like the ambience and location.  We'll see."
35118,2,"The band was awesome, even though they started late. I thought the cover charge was a little excessive for what's basically a sport's bar. The food was okay. Our server was incredibly rude after we switched from booze to soda. \nBut the vibe was fun, the band was fun and we had a good time."

35245,0,"Once upon a time this was a good place to get decent Indian food...alas they have changed chef/management and now it very poor quality.. I ordered Tikka Masala; it was, I am sure a sauce from Sharwoods that I can buy, plus the meat was huge chunks of chook...and the veggie rice I ordered was nothing more that boiled rice with some microwaved veggies thrown in,,,,will never go back..."
30589,2,"I have dined here twice. My first time was at 2AM with some friends. There were only 3 or 4 other tables and service was awful. Food was bad. We ordered a burger and my stomach felt bad immediately after. The more recent time was a couple of weeks ago after my husband and I caught the Mike Hammer Comedy Magic Show. We signed up for a players card beforehand and received a buy 1 get 1 free entree, so we both opted for the prime rib.\n\nThe prime rib was decent for being essentially $6/each with our B1G1. The veggies were pretty gross and I opted for chili on top of my potato which I thought was a good idea. It was \""award winning\"", although the win was likely from when they opened in 1966. The service both times were very short. The lady drops off water, gets your order, then drops off your check. No pleasantries, no anything, but it was surprisingly packed for dinner. I don't think I'll be back to Magnolia's unless I'm stuck downtown and there is nothing else open, but for what I got the second time around (prime rib), it was worth it. I would definitely never touch a burger again, especially at 2AM."

46895,0,"During a recent stay at MGM I decided on this to minimize the walking and it was a MyVegas reward so I assumed that would hold for something, but overall it failed just like hopes of hitting the big on in the casino.\n\nOur waiter seemed to be very distant or possibly sampled the paraphernalia from the Vegas underworld. In his \""defense\"" I did notice that the guy had more tables then he clearly could handle so I can't completely knock him. However he really didn't set much of a positive mood for the meal.\n\nFoodwise I had blueberry almond pancakes which on paper sounded good, but down the hatch it was all snake eyes. I found the pancakes to be really dry and the blueberries were far from sweet. \n\nTo say the very least I think the city should be noticed that this \""Avenue\"" is in dire need of repairs."
14285,3,"This hidden gem is a must stop for Mexican food, especially if you live in the East Valley.  I haven't been to Tia Rosa's in about 5 years, and boy has it improved.  The trees have grown so much that we drove past it twice because we didn't see the sign.  Tia Rosa's has two options, their front take-out restaurant and the main dining area.  It's just what you would expect when you walk into the Mexican style Hacienda, a water fountain and great courtyard for eating outside.  The menu is diverse and there are several vegetarian options.  I went with the Spinach enchiladas served with roasted corn and black beans, they were fantastic!  The table ordered carne asada, a beef burrito and the fish tacos.  All raved about the food.  The only complaint that we had was the salsa was just okay, it wasn't hot enough and their hot sauce was not very tasty.  We all wish we had a little more spice in our dishes, but the overall consensus is still a solid 4. If you decide to dine at Tia Rosa's try to get a table in the back courtyard or the room to the right of it, it will greatly improve the experience!"
15379,3,"of course since i stayed at the Bellagio, i went here to check it out. i knew since i stayed at the Bellagio, that this place would be a tad expensive, which it was. when I was there, the place was packed! my friends and i had bottle service so we did not worry about ordering drinks at the bar. The music was good. I'd go back here if I'm ever in vegas."
32144,3,"I LOVE Italian food. Recently, my children have been diagnosed with egg, dairy and gluten allergies....so out went the Italian food, until now. This place is great for anyone on the GF or candida friendly diet.  Almost everything can be made GF and the meats are nitrate, nitrite free. Most of the food options are also organic.\n\nThe restaurant appears clean, open and airy.  Picasso-esque art hangs from the walls and decorates the women's restroom. We have eaten in all three areas of the restaurant (bar, main dining and patio) and have enjoyed all three settings.\n\nWe have gone to this establishment multiple times and on multiple days. We aim for the happy hour so that we can take advantage of the 50% off appetizers.\n\nThe baked wings are wonderful. They are flavorful, not greasy and very delicious. We get ours with the sauce on the side and we think it's even better that way.\n\nWe get the hummus with the gluten free bread. The bread is not chewy or crumbly like some GF breads can be. The hummus is sprinkled with feta and decorated with olives, tomatoes and peperoncinis. It is not as creamy as many other hummus recipes can be, but it is flavorful and pairs well with the GF bread.\n\nWe get the GF pizza without cheese and it has never come out burned or chewy. (NOTE: GF pizza only comes in the medium size.). We have had several topping combinations and their gourmet pizzas and have yet to be disappointed.\n\nWe have also tried the Chipotle Penne with Chicken with and without the GF option. I would give it an 8 out of 10. It doesn't knock your socks off, but it is quiet yummy.  The Penne Steak and Mushroom (without the Gorgonzola cheese) is about a 7.5. It is not as flavorful as the Chipotle Penne, but is decent. I was expecting a more robust, flavor and was left disappointed.\n\nFor dessert we have had the GF chocolate chip and the GF brownie. NOTE: GF desserts are not as tasty and they are a little bit crumblier than the regular kind, but here they are pretty darn good. Both are equally tasty, it just depends on what kinda mood you are in.\n\nThey have excellent customer service. We have seen the manager, servers and other staff work well together and make sure that everyone's needs are being met. We have witnessed the manager quickly correct any issues that other patrons had."
33321,3,"I see a lot of negative reviews here on this business but I've had good experiences with them, sort of.\nI went in to ask about getting the carbs on my bike rebuilt. The cost was prohibitive for me but some guy, my apologies for not knowing his name , asked me what year my bike was. I told him and he said they won't even work on my bike because it was too old. Huh? He explained to me about how with bikes than ten years tend to have things break quite easily and end up costing them more to fix than they make. Ok, I can understand that.\nHe then tells me that when I bike has been sitting for a long while and the gas goes bad that the thing to do is run some SeaFoam through it and that will probably bring the bike back to it's original performance. Cool. \nSo he says they won't work on my bile but tells me the easy way to fix it myself. That rates pretty high in my book.\n\nThe second incident was when I went in for a clamp that I lost. He, same guy, asked me what it went to and I told him the air cleaner. He tells me that they don't have a clamp like that but I can use a zip tie to re-attach that hose to the air cleaner. I think that's some stand up advice. He could have easily told \""Sorry, ain't got one\""  and let me walk away bummed but he helped me out with some mechanic advice.\n\nIn summary, I've never had my bike worked on by them so I can't comment on that kind of experience but have been given good advice from them."
25197,1,"Rude waitresses!!!! They take forever to get to you and help other people before you when you have repeatedly made eye contact with them for the last 8 minutes.  Cool club.....used to play more hip hop but now its on the Rhianna/Lady Gaga vibe.  Aside from the waitress staff, nice club.  Stay away from the brunette in the cornerr closest to the entrance! She has an attitude problem."
6406,1,"Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta."
4670,0,"My family and I had by far the worst tire experience here! We were there for over 5 hours! When we first arrived they told us an hour and a half, then continued to say a few more minutes every time we would ask to see what was taking so long. Long story short, they ended up putting parts on our truck they didn't even talk to us about. The bill came to $1200 and something but we were told $762 when they started the truck. Avoid this place, they scammed a poor little old man before us as well, came in for an oil change and ended up spending 5 hours and over $700 dollars to leave again...poor Charlie. This place is filthy as well, dead bugs, broken lights, dirt EVERYWHERE......Go to Costco or Sams, trust me!"
41097,4,"I love OHSO!! The husband and I bike along the canal often and get sucked into the fun ambience of OHSO. They are a bike and dog friendly bar and restaurant, and they really mean it! They have a whole wall dedicated to their biker customers with locks and several tools for all your bicycle needs. They have a lot of bike parking right off of the canal next to the outdoor patio. I was so surprised to see the amount of dogs that people brought! They just hangout in the booths, either on the floor or in the seat or even underneath the booths. OHSO provides free dog treats and water bowls to keep your dog happy. We came to brunch on a Sunday, so of course they had all the football games playing around the bar. OHSO has a great Sunday brunch special which includes a 10 oz beer and a choice of one of their brunch dishes for $10. Even without the special their normal prices are awesome, with pitchers of quality beer for only $9!  We got the breakfast flatbread and a pitcher of Orange Blossom, that's from Papago brewery, and omg they were both delicious. The orange blossom had a unique taste of oranges and a hint of vanilla, it was hard not to chug all of it immediately! The flatbread was amazing, it had eggs, spinach, Spanish chorizo and much more I can't remember. You could taste the great quality of the ingredients they used! I saw a LOT ( i mean a lot) of people get the biscuits and gravy, which you would think is ordinary but they put a classy twist on the dish, I will definitely try it next time, it looks so good! The couple next to us also had bloody Mary's and it looked amazing too! Ill try that next time too! I plan to know OHSO like the back of my hand within the next few years because its an amazing place and we live very close! Can't wait to come back!"
45612,2,"We came after their first week of opening. Warning: booths are really tight and we are average sized people. Our server did let us know that they ordered new tables to rectify this.  We really liked the 75 flavors of wings offered. You can sample flavors, but you will be offered the sauce on a lid. Wings are $0.50 on Mondays. Also their signature potato chips were just ok. Prices are comparable to other wing joints. Service was pretty good and it is a young crew running the ship. Will keep in our rotation."
42720,3,"You gotta be hip to be SQUARE.\n\nWhat a cool idea to have their ice cream in a square instead of round.  This is so helpful in so many ways.....\n\na.  The taste - 5 Star - I personally like Mocha chocolate fudge and Coffee in waffle cone. I usually don't order ice cream but when I do, watch out!  There are so many flavors, I cannot tell you all, but the texture is rich and creamy, the taste is awesome, the quality is like Ben and Jerry compared to a generic brand. \n\nb.  Location - 4 star - Near to St. Thomas More on Wigwam and Pecos. usually no parking issues, but no shaded trees to park under.  Boo Hoo when it is over 100.  you come here to cool off and then you heat back up!\n\nc.  Ambiance - 4 star - The place is a long rectangle, which is great for long lines. However it is not inviting at all for sitting and eating inside. Just a bit \""cold\"" or lacking character.\n\nIf you love ice cream and want a treat this  is the place to go!\n\nIF you want an even more unique experience, and want a crepe with your ice cream, drive a few miles south to Crepe Shack and Waffle on Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the KMart Sears area.  This is a great place for Thrifty ice cream in a crepe with fruit.  Totally Yummy."
48410,3,"The acts were great...the type of stuff that you would find making it onto the further rounds of America's Got Talent altogether in one show...with a good variety...good character cast and some stuff I've never seen before. \n\nPaid $23 (tip included) for a mojito in a thin glass. It was a good mojito and if I wasn't a local but just here on vacation I wouldn't mind, but being a local, I think of all the food that could buy. =p\n\nOverall the entertainment exceeded my expectations, I wasn't sure what to expect."
18109,1,"First of all, I wouldn't really consider this an \""attraction\"" its more of a \""curiosity\"".\n If you find yourself in the general area and you have 15 minutes to kill, stop by.  Otherwise you're going out of your way to see  a few lions sleeping. \nI admit, lions are not something you see every day and the opportunity to see even one (despite the fact that it's sleeping) is fairly awesome. But you arrive, wait patiently for a spot close to the glass to catch a glimpse of one, take a photo and then you just kind of stand there. And then after a minute of that you start think \""Wow, these are seriously beautiful creatures. It sucks that they're stuck in this artificial environment getting gawked at all day.\""  I felt a little dirty afterwards. \nI will say the habitat itself is beautiful! 9 million dollars worth of beautiful.\nThere's also an informative recording that plays every 5-10 minutes. It tells you about the habitat, the lions and gives helpful factoids. One of which was: Lions sleep 18-20 hours a day. They are not dancing monkeys. \n\nTo view the exhibit itself is free, but if you wanna shell out $25 bucks you and one other person can get your photo taken with a lion cub. \nI'm not gonna lie. They were reeeaaalllyyy f***ing cute!"

18787,1,"absolutely detest this location. It is always busy, and people are extremely rude. Maybe I'm just not a fan of Walmart to begin with...\nHad some issues with being double charged on a credit card, not to mention it is overrun with noisy kids and angry soccer moms. I prefer going to Fry's or Albertson's. I can tell the people who work at this location are miserable too. If I have to buy something late at night I will stop in and get out quick, but that's about it."
9957,0,"This place is soooo off and on to me.  Is the food amazing??  yes, there is no denying that the food and drink of this resturant is amazing!  However the service always leaves something to be desired EVERY SINGLE TIME I come to the Paradise location.  For instance this past week i met up with some girlfriends to have drinks and tapas and my friend had to ask for her drink three different times and litterally 20 minutes later her diet coke showed up AFTER our sangria and mojitos had been on the table for like ten minutes.  I had to practically beg our waiter to give us any attention and to take our order.  The busser had more interaction with our table than our waiter.."
21673,1,"I have been to quite a few high teas over the years and I was very disappointed in the Frick Cafe's version of a high tea. You could only get one flavor of tea or had to pay extra for an additional flavor. All the tea sandwiches were on plain white bread with mayonnaise based salads which were disgusting. For the price, they could have used croissants. I have been to high teas that were not in the most sophisticated of places, unlike the Frick, and they still gave you more gourmet tea sandwiches than the Frick Cafe. Would not recommend this cafe for high tea."
45639,3,"I had the shrimp po'boy. It was pretty good, I would like to try the catfish one the next time I eat here. It's a nice size portion and all of my colleagues enjoyed their lunches as well (swamp fritters, shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e, and fried shrimp). They have really good sauces for the po'boy as well. I love the variety of the menu and the prices."
10846,2,"We came here for the $5 martini Tuesday and happy hour specials. \n\nAmbience: Very nice. Lovely views of the strip. Even though it's near the airport in a weird location, it works. Beautiful inside. Nice jazz musician playing in the lounge.\n\nService: Just eh.. she was really busy though, she had 10 tables which seemed weird to me.\n\nFood: Overpriced for happy hour (imo!) Chicken fingers were $7 for 3  freaking chicken fingers. $6 for fried mozzerella (just 4 pieces!). Kind of outrageous to call these happy hour specials if you ask me.\n\nDrinks: the martinis were very hit or miss. The coconut cream pie was yummy... the winter punch was gross... The panevino passion was probably the table favorite."
36148,2,"I thought the food was very tasty, but the portions are next to nil. I'm all about paying big bucks for a really good meal, but even for tapas style, this shit was way too expensive. But if you have the cash to spend $130 for food that does not fill you up but tastes really good, then this is the place for you. Now we can say we tried it but probably wont be going back."
7807,3,"I'm a guy.  I like watching planes.  I like watching old WWI style biplanes.  I like watching attractive women get in and out of old WWI style biplanes.  And I like doing all of the above while having breakfast.\n\nSometimes, while sitting outside, you get to overhear compelling conversations.  \""You know its hard buying underwear for you.  You have your father's irregular crotch.\""\n\nMy previous supervisor took me here one day for breakfast.  After a quick glance at the menu, I ordered an egg breakfast for under $4.  What a deal!\n\nTurns out, it was basically an egg mcmuffin.  So much for the deal, but you cant beat the ambiance.\n\nI took my wife here a few weeks ago, and she loved it.  One of my favorite places for breakfast."
14179,1,"We were craving pho after Tao but too lazy to head off the strip so we came here instead.  Surprisingly, they had their own version of pho called Zen Noodles.  It was like a \""fancy looking\"" pho, the broth was served separately on the side and it had more noodles than meat but it was good enough to satisfy our craving, although really not worth $14.\n\nThe primary reason I'm only giving two stars is because the wait time was horrible.  We got there around 3 AM, which was well before the club crowd so we were seated immediately.  After we gave our order though, we had to wait an eternity to get our food.  It was like that for all the tables next to us too.  Our waitress was apologetic and kept reassuring each table our food would be out in a couple minutes but a couple minutes ended up turning into an hour.  I get that it's busy but I can't imagine how long the wait would be for the people that came after us who actually had to wait in line for a table.  In total we were there for 2 hours but only 15 - 30 minutes of that was actually spent eating while all the rest was spent waiting (for our food, for the bill, for them to take our credit card...).\n\nIf you're looking for a place to grub after clubbing, I'd recommend going someplace else like Earl of Sandwich instead.  You can get a great tasting meal in a few minutes and for half the price."
39018,4,"Booked Jackie based on Yelp reviews and talking with her on the phone. We knew we made the right choice as soon as she arrived at our hotel room and our 20-month-old's face lit up with a big grin upon meeting her! She is prompt, friendly, professional and reasonably priced ... and it's obvious she has done this many times and knows what to do. She arrived with a big suitcase full of age-appropriate toys and I believe she was probably one of the highlights of our daughter's stay in Vegas! We felt completely comfortable with our daughter in her care for the two nights we booked her and I would gladly recommend her without any hesitation whatsoever. We are already looking forward to our next visit to Vegas knowing that we'll be able to enjoy a \""date night\"" or two if Jackie is available then."

22996,2,"After a long day, my vendor and I met up for dinner.  I asked him, what do you want to eat, he says he wants a piece of steak.  At first I said no but then I was like, I do want steak.  We scoured opentable and voila, Morels it was.\n\nWe ordered the caesar salad which was made table side.  It is a caesar salad, nothing special although I thought it had too much acidity and I wouldn't have minded some anchovies.  Before the salad came I was famished but the bread was nowhere to be seen.  I'm not sure why we had to ask them to bring the bread but we did however it was warm and soft and the butter and olive tapenade that came with it were a perfect combination.\n\nI did order a steak, a bone in rib eye but I had so much bread I couldn't finish it all.  The steak though wasn't all that great.  It was well cooked; I asked for medium rare and I got medium rare but the seasoning that was on it wasn't flavorful enough and the flavor it did have wasn't all that good.\n\nWe also ordered the pomme frites which are thin cut fries and those I do not like even though the truffle mayo it came with was delicious and a good sauce for the steak.  \n\nService was good and attentive.  I would probably want to try other steak houses next time I'm here."
214,3,this is a great place for those who enjoy looking at art and an alright place for a student like me to learn about art as a requirement for class. \n\nThis gallery was by far... the most attention grabbing because of its electric show... although I didn't understand the concept of it all... I really enjoyed my time there... I got some great photos from the trip... so it was a worth that much :)

Only because I eat them on a daily basis. I will look through the dvd's and books, but it's a hit or miss. \n\nBesides that though...who really needs a big o tub a mayo, 500 cans of tuna, or enough lettuce to make a tossed salad in my tub.

11196,4,"Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is an awesome decor and atmosphere. Much more elegant than other sushi restaurants. Food is great and awesome. Had the all you can eat- great value.

2741,1,"I would have given one star, but the exterior did look good.  I wouldn't recommend the \""upgrades\"" that they offer. Long story short, I was offered a wax and declined. Next he commented on dirt marks on the interior door, and the leather seats. He said as he was tapping my drivers seat \""we can make these look like new\"" he also said that they were going to \""clean everything\"". It also sounded like he said something about leather conditioner for the seats, but I'm not sure because his accent was very thick. I figured I could use those services because the car is two years old, and the leather could use a cleaning. I agreed to that, and went inside to pay. The cost of the interior clean upgrade was significant, and I was expecting the job would reflect the cost of the service. The inside is nice. There are comfortable couches inside and TV. About 20 to 30 minutes pass, and my car was ready. I go out to look at the job they did, and it was very obvious that they did absolutely nothing to the seats. The rest of the interior was pretty clean but it wasn't an amazing job either. I commented on how the seats weren't cleaned to the guy who takes the ticket. His response was \""no, that is something different.\"" I told him that the guy at the entrance said that the seats would be cleaned as well. The only cleaning they did on the interior was: the windows, vacuum and Armor All on the inside. I would have liked to talk with the manager about the issue, but did not have the time. Instead I just won't go back."
13166,0,"Stayed in the pyramid. Below mediocre. Feels like it was remodeled several decades ago, trashy feel, hasn't been updated in forever. Too many smoking rooms not enough non-smoking rooms. Poor lighting, difficult internet (no wi-fi), just an ethernet cable from wall. Bathrooms seem outdated, dusty, broken.. Very far walk from elevator to many of the rooms. Noisy.. so you always have to have fan on in room, and even then it's too noisy. Customer service hit or miss - most front desk staff seem very grouchy, but found an occasional cheerful person with customer service in mind. \n\nWhen I checked in I was told the non-smoking room I had confirmed through my reservation was unavailable - they had NO non-smoking rooms left and I would just have to deal with it, check back with them tomorrow. They said they could send someone up to 'freshen' up the room with some deodorizer. Eeeeks! I am allergic to smoke and any fake spray scented stuff so I quickly declined. They sent someone anyone and I sent him away. Called front desk and finally got another room that was tolerable. Bizarre. But glad I did not have to find another hotel as it was late at night when I checked in.\n\nI was here during winter and my room was freezing. Jacked up the heat but the room took hours to heat up. Sheet and one threadbare blanket did not help - so I bundled up in as many clothes as I could and lay under the covers. Did not want to ask for more blankets as I cringed at having to deal with front-desk staff and service staff."
11291,0,Awful does not begin to describe this clip joint.  Awful service and the food was about on par with a Dennys.  Somehow this place has managed to stay in business. I'll never be back again.  If you want good Italian in Vegas skip this place.
26692,4,"Best sushi in town period. Not bad on price, freshness, service or food portions.\n\nThe Gotta-Have-It-Roll is just that. Gotta have it! Always! I get cravings for it at least once a week. It at least twice the size of any other roll you will get in town (at least, that I've had, they are two-biters).\n\nThe BBQ is awesome! The wonton soup is awesome! Everything. Seriously Just give it a shot. Only a few lucky people know about this place and it deserves alot more attention. The red bean ice cream is really good too (they were out of green tea when I finally had room for dessert).\n\nLocation: Trop/Rainbow on the left side of the Little Caesars. It was formerly China Queen.\n\nI would also like to add if you like sports it's a good place to hang out at they are always watching sports when I go there."

My husband and I went here on Friday for happy hour. The atmosphere was definitely sleek and fun - I loved the colors and lighting, and the big windows looking out on Central definitely gave the whole place a real urban vibe. Since it was happy hour, 2-4-1 margaritas were our beverage of choice - he tried the citrus and I tried the melon. They were definitely refreshing (and cheap at the equivalent of $3.50 each), but they were a little sweet for our tastes. We planned to go elsewhere that night for dinner, so we decided to try just one appetizer. We selected the Chicken Phyllo Packets. They were just ok. The ingredients were all high-quality, and the portion was large for an affordably priced appetizer (~$8), but the flavor of the feta was overwhelming and we could barely taste the red pepper and chicken. For the price we paid for two drinks and an appetizer (~$17), we got to sit  and enjoy a lively after-work scene and we definitely had a good time. I hope that next time we go back, we experience the magic that is FEZ - I don't want to miss out!"
7667,3,The little mesa hasn't let us down for breakfast. It is a family owned an operated place. The coffee has always been good.  Service has always been cheerfull and attentive. If you expect\ncanned smiles and fake. Take your self important attitude to the trendy places.come here for solid breakfasts from a family that is consistently on target with a welcome and a hot meal. As a tip.. always ask for blueberries on your pancakes it is worth the upcharge.
48459,2,"Aghhhh... I really hate to give this a 3 star review. I wanted to love Joyride. My friends love Joyride. I love all the other restaurants in the Postinos family. I had a lukewarm experience with Joyride.\n\nWe went with a large group of friends. Started out with cocktails and chips and salsa. I had an aqua fresca with gin. It was good but light on the gin. Salsa was boring.\n\nWe then ordered our food and another round of drinks. I ordered the veggie burrito and a beer. My husband ordered tacos with a side of beans. My veggie burrito was just okay. It wasn't bad but I have had much tastier. I was excited about the \""white magic\"" sauce that came in it but it seemed non-existent. I doused a lot of hot sauce on my burrito. My husband liked his tacos a lot. We both thought the beans were very bland. My beer? Well, it took 40 minutes to come out. \n\nI have a hard time with the value at Joyride. Mexican food should not be this expensive... if it is then it should be very special. I wasn't feeling it. I love the atmosphere, servers were nice. They comped the beer they almost forgot. I am willing to give Joyride another try."
22446,3,"Almond croissant was definitely a signature item.  The chocolate croissant was good but nothing special.  Each pastry was $4.  Apparently, the clock/time machine looking thing in the middle of the store spits out free truffles periodically.\n\nOther important info: express line was super efficient and awesome, located close to Cesaer's Palace registration, Noodle No. 9, and right across from Rao's, it's a take-out type of place and first-come-first-serve seating, definitely try the almond croissant."
19374,3,"It's a great theater. Porque?\n\n-It's clean.\n-The staff is friendly, and the super cool guy who used to work at the Taco Bell drive-thru window up by Safeway works here, too.\n-It's cool, as in temperature.\n-The screens are really big.\n-The seats are really big...and soft...and comfortable.\n-The stadium seating gives you a good view.\n-It's never really crowded (which, I guess, is also a negative when it comes to the vitality of downtown).\n-It has 24 screens so the film you want is normally showing at the time you want to see it.\n-Parking is validated in the AZ Center garage.\n\nPor eso, me gusta the AMC at AZ Center."
23929,4,"What an amazing experience. So the ambience in the dining room was one of a kind. You would sit there with the smell of the campfire rolling in the dining room. I ordered the ribeye which was 7/10 and my wife had the salad bar (which was really fresh). After good discussion we ordered the s'mores kit and headed outside to find a fire pit. Amazing time cooking s'mores with the kid, and listening to great live country music. Ended up getting kicked out by security because no one is allowed outside after 11 because it turns into a bar. Regardless, what an amazing place and I'm making sure to bring all my friends from Wisconsin here because it is a down right her haw good ole time."
18600,1,"SOMAny places I would rather eat.  I understand this is supposed to be lighter healthier fare, but I was very disappointed by my salad.  VERY.  It was the salmon salad and the dressing was too vinegary and too off.\n\nI won't be returning, so I won't be trying anything else just to see if maybe I ordered the wrong thing."

11490,4,"Sashimi lover's rejoice! An all you can eat sashimi restaurant for a decent price.  \n\nHikari (as everyone else has pointed out) is a 3-section restaurant.  \n\n1) Steak house\n2) Tepenyaki\n3) Sushi!!!! (guess which one we went to!)\n\nFor valentine's Day, My lady wanted to go here so we did.  We were seated JUST as they opened and were greeted very warmly by everyone there.  The sushi chefs first asked, \""Are you doing all you can eat?\"" And of course we said yes.  That's when the floodgates opened.  The sushi chefs and wait staff are VERY attentive and very generous and you can't forget, very fun(ny).  \n\nWe started off with the normal sashimi; ahi, yellowtail, salmon, etc.  The lady also asked for some oysters (I'm not a big fan of them) and they just yelled out, \""One Dozen Oysters!\""  Every person there that ordered oysters was given a dozen.  Usually at an AYCE place,  You'd think they'd be kinda cheap with it and only give you 1 at a time, but this place was hugely generous.  It was even better when she told them I don't eat oysters so they took 10 of them back without complaining.  \n\nSo aside from the massive amounts of raw fish and rolls what sets this place apart?  Well, as an AYCE place, they have a REALLY good selection.  I already mentioned the oysters, but they also have scallop sashimi, uni and baby sweet shrimp on the menu.  First place I've seen that has these high price items on it.  \n\nThe scallops were where my lady friend went nuts.  She probably ate 15 total and the chef realized this.  The third time she asked for scallops, he said, \""Let me see your plate!\"" and plopped down 6 scallops on the plate.  Then asking \""Is that enough?\"".  You could see her eyes light up as we all had a good chuckle on the playfulness with the chef.  \n\nAbout 80% of the way through the meal, we asked on a whim, \""Do you have salmon belly?\"" And they did!!! Oh man I was in heaven.  \n\nThere is one drawback on the food aspect. It's all you can eat for about $28.  How fresh do you REALLY think the fish is?  It's fresh enough to be yummy but not fresh enough to be YUMM-O.   With the Uni, scallops, oysters, salmon belly, I'd definitely say it's worth it but it's not a place for me to go back every time I'm in vegas.\n\nSo why the 5th star?  What made it for me was the service.  That's where the extra star comes in.  The sushi chefs are generous and attentive as is the wait staff.  My tea never was empty and we always had fish in front of us.  One of the perks of being a smaller venue with 2 chefs.  They can give you more attention.  Also they're fun!  The sushi chef said, \""All you can eat anything on the menu... including me!\"" In which my lady friend said, \""Okay I'll take you!\""  His reply?  \""Okay I'll meet you after work\"".  My only advice was that he show up with scallops.  \n\nMy word of advice is to make a reservation.  We didn't have to worry about it since we were there so early but it is small.  I can see this place filling up.  I'd say it can hold about 20 people total."

47672,2,"I had dinner here last night because the conference dinner menu was southwest bbq and really thought that the resort could not pull off authentic bbq without a decent fire pit.   Went over to the Stonegrill, was seated immediately at a nice 2 top outside by the lawn and lagoon pool.   They had a decent by the glass wine list at reasonable prices considering the property. \n\nMy server Katie was knowledgeable attentive and made for a pleasant dining experience.   I started with the chili lime calamari with a cilantro crema dipping sauce.  The calamari was lightly coated tempura style and just kissed by the deep fryer so it was tender.  The bottom of the cast iron serving dish was lined with parchment paper which was oil laden and not a pleasant sight.  Glad that oil missed my tummy but it was off putting presentation. \n\nNext was a small farmers greens salad that looked beautiful and tasted wonderful.   A great recovery from the oily parchment paper.   It was lightly dressed with a jalape\u00f1o olive oil vinegarette.  Nice little spice kick.\n\nFor the main,  I had the braised short ribs with carrots on a bed of celeriac potato puree.   It was a good amount of meat and it was fork tender the way short ribs should be and succulent!  However there were only 3 tiny carrot slices (hhmm) and the puree barely peeked out from under the short rib.\n\nFor desert I had the apple crostada with a tres Leche sauce on the side.  I would say it was the best executed dish of the whole dinner.  \n\nOverall, for the price the presentation needs to be of a better quality and the side quantities need to be more generous however the dinner was tasty and would probably go back again when visiting this property."
43250,0,"I've never really had a bad experience at a teppenyaki restaurant before. Each has their own flair and characteristics that make them stand out from the rest. But this place, this place was repulsive! \n\nWe walked in and saw a family of three sitting at a teppenyaki table. No drinks or appetizers had been placed at their table yet so we thought we scored on getting a seat at a table right away. But alas, they told us, their order had already been placed. Next table wouldn't be available for 20 minutes. Ok, that's fine, so we sat at a regular table. \n\nWe ordered some iced tea and gyozas to start off. Tea was horrible to say the least. Gyozas seemed like they were frost bitten but the sweet sauce covered any ill flavorings. \n\nAt the advice of the server, I ordered The Godfather roll. Now it wasn't too shabby, but for 13 bucks, I expected a little more flair, but it came out slightly boring. But thats when I noticed someone go over to that family of 3 and start taking their order. So much for already having put their order in!!! Wth?!\n\nOnward to the entrees. Now where do I begin... Tonight, they were offering a special on steak dinners which should have been a red flag, but I couldn't help but think BOGO?! Hell yea!! \n\nWhen our soups and salads came out, oh my, were they bad. The soup seemed to be the bottom of the stock. It was way too overpoweringly salty, cloudy, and just down right disgusting. Salad, I'm not a big fan of salads served at Asian resturaunts, so I don't have anything to compare to, but my husband said it was just as bad as the soup. After waiting what seemed like an eternity, our food finally arrived. And it was COVERED in pepper. I mean, drenched. Now, I love pepper. More than the average person, but that was intense. The fried rice lacked any depth in flavor, I mean, besides the pepper. The steak was tough and also fatty and held no flavor. The veggies, you can't go wrong with veggies right?! Wrong! Now, I don't make it a habit to spit food out at a table, but that was so raunchy, it came right out. It was so over salted, holy Hell. The shrimp was frost bitten and over cooked. Oh man, Our meal was such a miserable mess. And to top it off, service was sub par. The server wasn't bad, but the place was so understaffed, it was hard for her to keep up. And sadly, it wasn't all that busy, so I really don't know who to be mad at. Regardless, we won't be back. Sad way to start my weekend."
3131,3,"Great food, always fresh and innovative items on the menu. The staff is very friendly and attentive to what's going on. I also like that much of their produce comes from local sources."
24807,4,Nothing better than enjoying a pitcher beer special while my dogs get to run around and be social! Lots of delivery food options in the area with menus by the bar makes for an even better experience.... Just don't call domino's - they mess up your order every time. The staff and customers are friendly which keeps us coming back
34619,0,"(My original review is posted below)\n\nAt this point in time, I still have not gotten my money and I am still being charged by Gold's Gym, will be sent to collections, but I do not have an account with Gold's, thus even though I would pay, I would not be able to GO to their gym. WTF?!!?! Read on if you are curious...\n\nI have been dealing with Gold's Gym at least 3 times a week.. at certain points it was every single day...since I found out they didn't actually cancel my account.\n\nI was reimbursed for the $50 they charged me as a \""rate guarantee fee\"" that the sales man agreed to wave (which obviously was a huge lie). Then my account was charged AGAIN after I was told my account was cancelled (for probably the 6th time). The salesman asked me to come down and pick up the cash again but I had just been there 2 days prior and it is not at all a quick commute. I asked him to mail it, provided my new address, and he repeated it to me. A week or more goes by and I have no gotten it. Turns out he sent it to the wrong apartment number. He apologizes and says he will send it out ASAP. Then another 2 or so weeks goes by and I'm furious and it turns out he sent it to the completely wrong address. My OLD address from where I moved AWAY from (the reason I wanted to cancel in the first place!). Then I call him, give him my address AGAIN and have him repeat it to me. This was about a week ago and I still have not gotten the money.\n\nToday I get a call from their outside billing company and they tell me that I am still in their account (despite Gold's Gym telling me that they have completely taken me out) and they are planning on sending me to collections if I don't pay what is overdue as well as a cancellation fee if I still want to cancel).\n\nSo... Gold's wants me to pay them for a gym membership that I cannot even use. And they want me to continue to pay for this for another 9 months. \n\nHow do these people sleep at night?"
2,0,"All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\n\nOur food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\n\nWe asked for water, they brought us 1 in a SOLO cup for 2 people. I asked for hot tea, they said 10 minutes. What Chinese restaurant does not have hot tea available upon request?\n\nOver all.... my first and last visit to this place. The only good point was that it was cheap, and deservingly so."
378,0,"I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. \nI started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \"" missing manual or dead battery\"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. \nI was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. \nI asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. \nI get \""as is\"" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.\nNow I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. \nThank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.\n\nPissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad"
3560,2,"Went here for a quick dinner. Food was just average, not too special and not as good as I would expect in the Mexican restaurant. I had an impression that we were a bit neglected by the waiter and waitress, maybe because we had a small order and didn't feel like drinking tons of alcohol, not sure. Salsa was good, but I need a bit more to Mexican restaurant than a good salsa."
47880,2,"My wife and my daughter and I gave Nan & Byron's a try for their Sunday Brunch buffet. Nice selection with a few of the usual items - scrambled eggs, sausage links, bacon, biscuits, grits - and a few that were a bit more unusual including a huge tray of oysters, large shrimp, meatloaf squares and a good few things made with sweet potatoes.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the shrimp (with a New Orleans remoulade, but would have preferred a classic cocktail sauce) and the sweet potato au gratin. Sliced salmon was good too, but I didn't really feel like waiting for the toaster to toast.\n\nService was okay with a waiter who refilled Diet Coke often but coffee not as much. I think he was maybe disappointed that we didn't go all in for the refillable mimosas or bloody marys. We're not all booze drinkers, ya know?\n\nParking's challenging with a small lot but there are some spots to be found on the street."

The atmosphere is very laid-back, though the place is often very busy. And the food absolutely amazing! My only negative point would be the staff who are sometimes pushy and arrogant (no need to be, you'll get your tip don't worry!)"
40310,3,"Like a few others have said, I was kind of nervous to go here bc of some of the reviews, but we had a great time!  The decor is really fun, our waiter was very nice and all of the food we got was excellent - I was with 3 other people and we all really loved our food, and the 2 desserts we got (the donuts were the best!).  The only things that weren't great were really the bar service - the drink menu is pretty small, and when we tried to order something off-menu it took literally 20 minutes for us to get our drinks - which were then not good, so we sent them back and asked for something else (a drink from the menu and a glass of wine); it again took 20 minutes for our drinks to get to our table.  So, that was a little annoying but the rest of the experience was great!  I will definitely go back."

Overall, a great place.  I definitely recommend!"

32551,3,Solid 4 stars for the food itself.  Service was a little lacking though.  The brunch menu was delightful.  I ordered the grilled cheese and it was made from Tillamook Cheese!!!  I'd recognize that taste anywhere.  Took me back to the grilled cheese sandwiches I used to make myself when I was growing up on the West Coast.  Will probably be back to try other items on the menu.
43660,4,"When it comes to airport food, there generally aren't many great options. It's usually a mixture of chain restaurant or something of equal or lesser quality. Then there's Beaudevin.\n\nI don't know where this place came from. I can't even find a website. It's almost like it was quietly placed here by a divine Airport God as our reward for dealing with TSA's across the lands. This is easily the best and fanciest place I've eaten at Any airport. \n\nI ordered a bagel with a side of all the necessary ingredients for a lox bagel combination creation (herbed cream cheese, capers, red onions, tomatoes and smoked salmon). Everything tasted fresh enough for my liking. The salmon was great. Mind. Blown. \n\nIf you're flying into Charlotte and have some time to spare, check it out. I read they also have one in Chicago O' Hare and Miami. Travelers rejoice!"
753,0,"This was by far the worse MG I have dined. All 5 entrees (big family) ordered were served cold. Not warm, not luke warm, COLD! After being re-heated undoubtedly in a microwave we discovered that each guess was discussing who had the more bland tasting dish. We have always enjoyed MG and it was a complete shock to have this type of experience. We will not return.  There were 2 exceptions to this tastless cold meal....the house salad dressing and the bread."
15211,2,"I was suprised how much I liked Kahunaville. Sandwiches are all very reasonably priced- around 11 bucks- and very large.

47613,2,"I don't think I can add more to what has been said about the midwives who are an all-star team at Momdoc Midwives. There is ultrasound facility within their location and they have managed to have free slots whenever I needed one, so that's great. Props for the covered parking structure. The staff is also mostly receptive and responsive, although they all seem to be new kids on the medical block and there is not an experienced hand in sight.\n\nHowever, I think they can do better with their procedures. They do hand out little appointment cards with option to leave feedback online, but I keep losing those things .I am not sure how else I can get my feedback over to them, so I hope they are reading this:\n\n1. They don't give you blood test (and possibly other test) results over the phone, even if they are normal. I have never been to a practice where they are unwilling to even mention IF there is a problem that needs further discussion with the doctor. For a normal pregnancy where you are meeting with a midwife at regular intervals, this is obviously not a problem but for my well visit, they wanted me to come back in only to tell me that everything was fine. The midwife that first saw me did tell me that if I didn't get asked to come back in, it was all good but that was not what I was told on the phone. When I called back another time to confirm their policy, I was told that no test result is shared by phone. I am not sure of the logic of their policy, but if you're working, that means you have to take time off for no reason and pay for a visit just to be told nothing. \n\n2. The check in process is an attempt at being cool. I have no opinion on the decor - just not my style. I like being able to settle in while being individually attended to by a med assistant. I also love that you don't have to fill long forms - the med assistants (\""concierge\"") ask you questions and you just answer them so they enter it. However, the ipads are a clumsy way to check in. To me, they seem to struggle to balance the ipad with one hand and enter info with the other. There is a lot of data entry happening, and a touch screen keypad is clumsy for the purpose. I had to correct the door number to my address twice (abcd entered as acbd, abdc, etc.) At least have a couple of dockable keypads for checking in new patients who have a boat-load of information to give. \n\n3. I think the med assistants can be trained better and possibly have someone guide them in the first couple of weeks. In four visits, I had new recruits twice. I had no issue with the extra time it took for the first to check me in, but my visit today was terrible. The new recruit was slow, inefficient and took a LOOOONG time to enter information on the ipad, but that wasn't even the issue. She was trying to gather information that I had already given on my first well visit as well as my first maternity visit. I was there to discuss my miscarriage, and she was re-asking me questions like \""do you experience irritability or bloating before a menstrual period?!!!\"" I was already pretty upset, and I was ready to show her what my non-PMS-irritability was like. She took about 10 long minutes trying to find a phone number to the CVS nearest me (which she finally could not find) even as I was telling her that I have gotten written prescriptions before and didn't need them called in (not at that speed in an emergency anyway). She kept asking for dates of miscarriage and last menstrual period and previous births and pap smears and ... when asked why this information wasn't available to her when I had already submitted all the information, she simply said \""I am supposed to ask these questions.\"" I realize now that I should have simply asked for someone else to help me or help her. Unfortunately for me, I had other things on my mind at the time. \n\nAlso, please, please, please, put up a board somewhere by the road so people don't spend 20 mins scratching their heads and driving around trying to find your office. My husband who took some time off work to join me for an appointment drove around looking for the place and was considerably late (I had turned off my phone to be polite). \n\nStill, these are relatively minor issues and I will continue to go to Momdoc Midwives for their amazing medical staff."

44441,1,"The food is delicious but my only concern would be the customer service. I've been there a few times.Twice, I've been ignored waiting to make an order while waiting in the front. All I see is the employees having a nice chat with another table."
25795,0,"I've been to a lot of different Keg Steakhouses around Canada, but I would not return to this one.  The food was good, but the service was horrible.  I've been to the Keg in Old Montreal many times, which is always a great experience.  Friendly staff and good food.  Here at Place Ville-Marie... it was a different story.\n\nThe staff was plentiful, young, attractive and bored.  They all stood around chatting and flirting with one another instead of attending to customers.  The worst part were the hosts/hostesses.  They were plain rude and upset that we were carrying large bags.  They wanted us to check them.  Ridiculous - there was lots of space at the tables, and the restaurant was half empty.  We received a lot of attitude.  \n\nI will never be back at this location!  When in Montreal, go to the one located at the Old Port instead.  So much better."
7853,2,Food is good. The burger is great. The service a bit slow and dreamy. They think they are Bohemians and they aren't. Finally avoid the owner she is a complete ditz and space case...just smile and avoid this cat lady.  Cheers.
27641,4,"Love Big Dog Coffee! I am a huge fan of the oatmeal bar, iced coffee and iced lattes. I normally visit this spot everyday before work (oatmeal and iced coffee). \n\nThe interior space is beautiful, sort of a anthropologie feel to it. A lot of eclectic pieces with out looking like a cheesy TGI Fridays. Also the patio area has charming wrought iron furniture for the occasional nice day in Pittsburgh. \n\nPro: really friendly staff, oatmeal bar, sunny interior, great coffee\nCon: Oatmeal bar can be a bit pricey( although the serving is huge), could use a couple more comfy cars. \n\nOverall: Great place for studying, reading, first date and people watching!"
45759,4,"I have only been to Vegas twice (both this past year) and I'm in love with the HRH! The service is great, the staff is super nice, and the overall tone of the hotel is down right rockin'! \n\nI love that the lighting is dim (you'll always look good in low lights) and that the colors of the casino are all dark purples, oranges, and reds. It is a sassy atmosphere with a hint of bad-ass. The dealers are all very nice and are very helpful if you have questions. The cocktail waitresses are all very beautiful and very accommodating. They don't always come around when you want them, but wait a little bit and you'll find a cute little number asking if anyone wants drinks. Be quick though! You have to order pretty fast because they go to all the tables and try to get everyone's order. I was skipped over a few times because I didn't speak up. \n\nThe clothing shops there borderline the L.A. look and what Criss Angel wears. I was uncomfortable when I went into those shops because the staff took a look at me and kind of turned their noses up. It was fine with me because the clothes are definitely not my look. If you like heavily designed and decorated clothes and you wear your hair quite spiky and hair-sprayed, then I'm sure you'll be in heaven.\nYou can get a tattoo as well! There is a tattoo parlor that take appointments as well as walk-ins. They are always busy, so I'd definitely call before you go.\n\nThe hotel rooms are spectacular. They have three towers and all three of them are amazing. The rooms have super comfy beds and flat-screen televisions with iPod compatible radios. The showers are huge and very nice.\n\nThe pools are all outside and I don't recommend going in them until the busy seasons. The off seasons they heat one pool to about 80 degrees, but honestly, it feels more like 50 degrees.\n\nIt is a little bit off the strip, but it is only about a $10 cab ride to the strip. Walking isn't bad either, just make sure you have a buddy to walk with. \nI heavily recommend you staying here. Honestly, I don't think you'll be let down."
22911,4,Whenever you're in Vegas.. Make sure to hit up this place..  I strongly suggest getting the bottle service... And if you do... Holla at my friend Shannon Belshoy (bottle agent) She is very courteous and professional.. Good Times
25632,2,"Rooney is a pricey yet, stylish boutique offering cool fashion for both genders. I love their selection of Barbour jackets, Gitman shirts and Alden footwear. Somethings are a little ridiculous like $160 for a pair of shorts. There are cheaper ones however, but still...\n\nService is only okay, I would expect a store with this price point to offer perhaps a little more friendly service. At least paying at the till was fast.\n\nTake advantage of their sales that happen once in awhile to offset the high pricetags here!"
2995,1,We only went to this place once and I wasn't very impressed.  We had to wait outside in the hot sun for a table since the restaurant is so small.  The food was nothing exciting and it is not a comfy atmosphere at all.  The only good thing is that the prices are low and I am sure it would be fast service on a weekday since you order at the counter.
8218,4,I like Bandera. The food is upscale bar food but the presentation is good and I love the wood smoke flavor the meats have. Some of the servers are a bit uppity but in general they are very professional and quick. I will keep coming back. I love the cornbread appetizer.
20859,2,"I usually dine at the Thomas Rd. location, where everything is great.  This time, I decided to give this one a try, expecting a similar experience, but here's some of what I found up here:\n\n*  It's quite similar inside to the Thomas Road location, but the dining area isn't furnished as well.\n\n*  Went for soup first, as usual, but there were no soup spoons out, or available.  (Have I eaten at 100 other buffets here in the Valley without ever having run into this?)  An employee told me they let themselves run completely out of them to save money.  (I thought to myself, \""They could save even MORE money by closing this location... and maybe they should!)\n\n*  Went for a chicken wing, which is what I eat!  The only way you could get one here, was firmly attached to more of the chicken!  The whole thing was heavily breaded & cooked with the skin on, so there was no hope of pulling it apart at the serving tray.  It was either take it the way you don't want it, or don't have it at all.  Please someone, teach the preps here how to cut up a chicken!!  (Was I 8, or 9, when I learned how to do it?)  That's enough of an example of how the whole visit went here.  You get the idea.\n\nOverall, the food was about the same as Thomas (good), but the serving area setup here is also not as attractive or convenient as the one on Thomas, so for me the place plummeted all the way down to 3-Stars from the 5 I had expected it to earn.\n\nOn the way home, I sang \""Could've Been\"" by Tiffany."
25672,3,I am not one to just go to a bar or pub to have a drink but I stop by this spot often with my co-workers for lunch on Fridays because it's a great place to have a beer over lunch. \n\nThey have some very tasty choices. Here are some of my favs:\n-Titanic Burger with flavours and size just as gigantic as the ship.\n-Guinness Burger.... just try it :)\n-Bison Burger
21528,1,"2 stars only for the Hal way decent food, and cold beer. But they don't fill your beer glass all the up, maddening. As for the service, 1/2 star. Our waitress was terrible. She took a very long time to bring beverages, we are talking 30 mins at some points.  Go elsewhere!! Plus the crowd is obnoxious.\n***UPDATE***\nThe owner got ahold of me concerning my review. While I stick to my original review I would like to acknowledge that the owner took the time to reply to me to try for another chance/review. If I stop in again I will perhaps change my opinion, or they will help change my opinion."
26998,4,Look fo coupons! Great bread. Good food.
33304,2,"I went to Lane Bryant today and really enjoyed their selection of clothing. \n\nAt a size 14, I am on the cusp and can shop at most dept. stores w/o having to go to the dreaded plus size dept. I hate plus size clothing! They are always very drab and boring, childlike, or so over the top you are just asking for unwanted attention, so I try to stay away from them as much as possible. But, because Lane Bryant was close to where I was shopping I decided to go in. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how modern and up to date their clothing was. I saw very little \""fat lady\"" style clothing, and was happy to look around at their selection. \n\nWhile entering the store I noticed their sizes were 14-?(cant remember the number it goes to) so I thought I would find something here. Remarkably, there was very little items in a 14 and I was disheartened by this. I'm sure they don't get alot of size 14's in the store, but if you advertise that you carry that size you really should. \n\nThe staff was not very friendly, and very disorganized. \nThe dressing rooms were clean, but the mirrors are very annoying. They are tilted and lighted in a way that makes you look better than you actually do, in turn making the clothes look better on. From now on, I will make my purchases, go home, try on the clothes, and return if I need to. \n\nI ended up walking out with a great pair of earrings (they were on clearance for $4.99, and a gorgeous black dress. The dress is too large, but I am going to take it to a tailor and have it fitted correctly. \n\nThe clothes here are a bit pricey. I noticed t-shirts with screened print for $30. The dress I purchased was $69.99. Next time, I will probably try Macy's 1st and if I don't find anything I will come here. \n\nAlso, check their website for in-store deals before going. I did not, and later noticed that they were having a 25% off sale that I did not know about and did not get the promotional discount."
8381,3,"Tried them for the very first time yesterday afternoon.\n\nAside from not knowing that you paid the young kid standing outside w/your treats, I think I did okay. I ordered a single cheeseburger with all the fixin's and a small soda. Burger were pretty tasty! They could have gone a little lighter w/the mayo, but overall - not too shabby!\n\nI've heard rave reviews on their tots as well - can't wait to try these puppies some other day. Oh, and all of their slushies and shakes."
29718,4,"I asked my Phoenix friend to take me to the best Mexican restaurant in town, and this is where he took me on my visit. I am happy that he did. I returned again during my trip. This restaurant had everything I love -- excellent and inventive drinks, delicious fresh chips with homemade salsas (the verde sauce rules!) and among the best guac I've had, and creative dishes in small portions that pay homage to the traditional Mexican menu. My favorites were the Elote street corn, which I think I could eat every meal for the rest of my life, the chicken taco, and the salad with grilled chicken, apples, mint and peanut sauce. The sangria was the best white sangria I've had in any restaurant.\n\nOne caveat to this rave review: I did not care for the pork torta. I do not like to eat a lot of bread, and the sandwich was ridiculously huge and overwhelming. Beneath the cavernous bread was a small portion of pork. Perhaps it is my Tennessee sensibilities about pork or my Californian experience with carnitas, but the pork was lackluster, dry, and tasted like that pork you get in a sandwich in the school cafeteria with the pre-mixed sauce. The restaurant should make torta \""sliders\"" and add a generous portion of real carnitas to improve this dish (see the Pastor at Taco Guild for an example).  \n\nOverall, though, it is hard to beat this experience, the friendliness of the staff, the excellent food and all of the options that left me wanting more."
30736,1,"So far no chicken and waffle place has been that good (lo-lo's, roscoes, home of chicken and waffles).  There chicken needs a little more kick to it... The red rooster helped but my moms chicken is way better... The grits could have used some more salt also... The service was really good but the prices were kinda high but that seems to be the thing with chicken and waffle places I guess... High prices for something that can be done at home  for a fraction of the price.  It wasn't bad but then again it wasn't great also... Roscoes is better in my opinion and they offer more..."
37688,4,"SmashBurger is my absolute FAVORITE.  I think it's equal to In-N-out, if not better.  I suggest the Sin CIty Burger.  WORTH THE PAY!!!!"
12572,4,"The Venetian is one of my favorite hotels to stay at on the Las Vegas strip...in terms of price it is more expensive than $50/night at Circus Circus..but you really get what you pay for when you stay here.  All the rooms are luxury suites...luxurious beds, living room, and a huge bathroom w/ a shower & roman bathtub..there's even a plasma in the bathroom! lol Some other cool little perks about the hotel room is that it has remote controlled drapes/blinds and you have 2 plasmas..one over by the bed and another in the living room...pretty cool if the dudes wanna watch sports while i watch mtv or america's next top model. lol It can also sleep 6 people comfortably if you get a room w/ 2 double beds b/c in the living room the sofa folds out into a sofa-bed.\n\nThe Venetian is also in a pretty good location on the strip b/c it's walking distance from the forum shops at caesar's and right down the street from the wynn. \n\nI also love some of the restaurants here...grand luxe cafe and enoteca san marco are definitely worth checking out!"
21710,0,"This place is Garbage. \nWe had bought two tables bottle Service the works. \n\nSecurity is a joke, need i say more.  \n\nI got the boot for literally saying something about pot, in a joking manor.  Security came lit my cigarette and then escorted me out.\n\nPs. they allow smoking inside etc, if you didnt know already\n\nBunch of Gorillaz in there save your money hit the Marquee do something else but the Luxor in my opinion is going downhill.\n\nFemales = minimum\n$50 dollar entrance for a sausage fest.  Do like me and role with females.  Youll be treated much better..\n\nDONT FREQUENT THIS PLAE THERE SO MUCH BETTER"
23203,4,Tandoori chicken and chicken madras is really good!
33802,0,"This place is the worst. I was a customer for  2 years. & was always dissatisfied with things but was too lazy to look for a better salon until this week!  I've had enough of this place. Don't bother paying  extra money for a deluxe pedicure because you get a regular pedicure & they'll argue with you that you got the deluxe but you didn't. The deluxe is supposed to be a longer massage & my pedicure was done in 15 minutes which is not even the amount of time if a regular pedicure! I told them I paid extra for a deluxe & didn't get it & they argued back that I did. The owner does sloppy work on her fills too. They rush through their work so they can get back to their phones & laptops! They constantly take personal calls while working and they speak non stop Vietnamese to each other when customers are there. They burn insense in front if their Buddah statue that gives me a pounding headache. They've had a few nasty male guys working here as well that had bad chair side manner but have since been fired but still employ the man that ripped me off on a deluxe pedicure. They do not clean their tools well, have thick dust on the pictures on the walls and the male owner frequently sleeps in his chair in the back of the salon. Run to find another place and don't go here!"
17782,0,My husband and I ate here today by default as we planned to eat at the Cornish Pasty next door but the music inside(and blaring out into the parking lot) was SO LOUD we had to walk out. We chose the Pink Pepper as we like Thai food. It was the WORST I have ever eaten.  THE WORST! Thai? Chinese? Who knows but the buffet lunch was disgusting. Total waste of money. Good shopping mall restaurants to avoid.
9248,3,"Awesome place for pho ! Special combination is good,  but there serving is  not consistent sometimes you get a big portion then next time you get a sad face\n :( but this is the only restaurant that serves pho in my area . Service is excellent ! Hope \nThis information is useful :)"
24147,0,"We walked into a nice atmosphere.  The hostess was nice, and our waitress was great.  The food was not good, and not worth the money they are charging.  The appetizers made no sense with the offerings on each plate.  We have eaten at some of the best restaurants on the east coast, California, and New Orleans (Commander's Palace for example).  Cork's offerings are way over-priced.  The duck was so salty I couldn't eat it, and they took the entree off the bill.  My wife also complained about her entree being too salty, but they did not take her plate off the bill.  Sex discrimination?  Maybe.  One thing is for sure.  We won't be going back, and we won't be referring any friends here."
22849,2,"I mostly came here for Poke Express. Poke Express is amazing. But as for Island Sushi and Grill...\n\nIt's okay I guess? I got a kalbi and tonkatsu lunch combo, but compared to Island Specialties downtown, there just wasn't very much for the same price.\n\nThere's 3 small pieces of kalbi and one medium piece of tonkatsu, plus Mac or tossed salad for $9 something. Overall decent and what I expected, but could have been more.\n\nAt least service is friendly and they are fast.\n\n3.5 stars"
40518,1,"I don't want to sound like a broken record by repeating what many have said BUT, I so wanted to like this place too and didn't. It's closer than our go to place, Pinkaow so we were happy to see a new Thai place in our area. \nMy husband had his favorite Spicy Chicken Mint and I had Pad Kee Mao with tofu. The noodles were good but the chicken dish had way too much sliced onion and the spice level was way off. I'm not exaggerating when i say about half of the dish was sliced onion.\nMy husband has a pretty high tolerance for spice but went with their \""medium\"" spicy. To test out our first order. It was way hotter than it should have been. He normally gets the \""Thai Spicy\"" from Pinkaow, which is just above their 10 level but said Gaatis medium was just as hot if not hotter. For a medium spice level, it was way too hot.\nThe prices are slightly higher than Pinkaow but you get less food. \nI figure maybe we need to give them a second shot and order other dishes but based on our first experience, it would be hard to go back when we know what we are going to get from our other reliable go to Thai restaurant."
29086,2,"Doctors has been a steady number on the Grassmarket pub scene for as long as I can remember, although I can't say I've felt compelled to enter its hostelry doors a huge amount of times. Doctors is a perfectly straightforward place to go and have a drink, what you see is what you get and all that jazz, and there is positivity in that, because at least you always know where you're at. \n\nThe actual premises are fairly big, so there's quite a bit of seating room if there's a big group of you, plus the pub is really well located and convenient from a lot of angles, whether you're coming across the meadows, or up from town. I've used it as my quick go to for a handy drink when I've been short on time, and just want somewhere to go where I'm guaranteed a seat during the day. \n\nDoctors is really just your no nonsense, traditional and straightforward pub, although I do feel it's maybe a bit too plain and straight to business, which affects the overall feel of having a drink here. It is always busy at night and the weekends, so you're getting great atmospherics in that sense, and if you want to meet an Edinburgh University student or 2,000, this is the place to attend."
40035,0,Lobster Roll implies it is served on a roll. Not a piece of white bread similar to Wonderbread. Respect the lobster. Respect yourself. \n\nPlus it is too pricey for what you're getting. Not into it.
360,1,"Love their coffee.\nThey need to add help in the morning.\nWith all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.\nI'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.\nUsually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel\nThey should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business."
48905,4,"Yum, yum, yum!\n\nWill try not to repeat other diners reviews so here goes:\n\nLoved the burgers. Juicy, well cooked and good quality, home made burgers.\n\nLoved the chips. Partly skin on, yummy, perfectly cooked, crispy where it counts and fluffy inside.\n\nFab gluten free buns (burger gf) - looks like brioche buns but held together really well and really impressed they do gf buns too!\n\nGreat ice cream - maple syrup and walnut home made on the premises. \u00a31,75 for a decent sized scoop in a tub with toppings at 50p each. Yummy as were the toppings: honeycomb and I also asked for peanut butter. Proper US peanut butter. \n\nToilets - lovely and clean. Always a good point.\n\nSo, burger, chips, coke, ice cream and toppings, about \u00a312.50. Went home in food coma and raved about the gf greatness of the burgers. Staff friendly and left us to chat. Love the environmental commitment with Vegware packaging being used. Can't wait to go back!"
44499,2,"Came with a party of 6 and was seated right away. Atmosphere was a bit fancy. A lot of people were really dressed up. Made me feel outta place with jeans lol. \n\nPROS: \n-Decor is very lovely. Felt really cozy and welcoming. Very modern style. \n-Customer service was superb. \n-Food came out at a timely manner.\n-Riki was our server and he really was nice and recommended a lot of our food choices for the night. \n\nCONS:\n-The restaurant was really small so limited seats but we came at a good time so it wasn't a big issue. \n-Prices are kinda high for the portions. \n- Noticed that some of the items on pictures from previous diners weren't on the menu. They really took a lot off and the dinner menu was seriously lacking. My husband had to request for them to make the burgers. It wasn't on the menu. \n\n------------\nOrdered 3 backyard burgers.\nHusband and siblings liked the burgers but the fries were overly cooked. He also said that it tastes like Smashburger. \nOrdered 2 scallop ceviches, parents liked them a lot. I thought it was really salty. \nI ordered duck confit salad. It was very salty and it was also highly recommended from yelp reviewers but I don't really see the hype. Sorry guys. \n\nThen it came to dessert. \nOrdered Carmel and vanilla bean ice cream and a strawberry shortcake. I think the desserts were the main highlight of the night."
39832,3,"Great addition to south hills. Recently opened. Hidden in the courtyard of a shopping / office complex. Small trattoria with limited outdoor seating. BYOB. Owned by a husband and wife team. Food was great and service was excellent . Only gripes.. small seating area , only take reservations for a party of 6 or more and I felt the food portions were a bit small. Definitely give this place a try."
31634,0,"Worst B Dub's ever........\n\nSo it began when the guy at the host counter sat us all the way in the back of the restaraunt.  Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.\n\nIt gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.\n\nBy this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.  \n\nAs we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.\n\nI called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.  Not that you give a turkey anyway.\n\nI'd rather lick the floor of a KFC than visit this B Dub ever again."
35300,4,What an awesome show!!!  From beginning to end they incorporate the audience into their act and make you feel part as if you are part of the show.  They go through the crowd and engage the audience with non verbal gestures that are just hysterical.  There are even some parts of the show where the whole cast is running around in the audience going crazy.  \n\nThe music and lighting for the show is top notch and has been really well thought out for the performance.  Just imagine watching a 2 hour episode of Americas best dance crew with only Jabbawockeez nonstop craziness.  I really have to give it up to these super talented Jabbawockeez crew members that are just awe inspiring with all the dance skills that they possess.  I guarantee you will leave the show with a smile.
4876,4,Much better than ANY casino. Great food and service. The menu is fantastic. Breakfast and lunch.   Look for it just west across from Palace Station.
29082,1,"The food tasted great, but my burger was more of a meatball than a patty. Eating it was a physical challenge which was a shame because it was so good when it finally engaged my taste buds. The service was so-so. I felt like the place was trying so hard to be hip that it was going to have an seizure. The details about it being very loud are not kidding. Do not go if you are looking for a quiet place to chat."
25332,1,"You remember that scene in Sopranos when Toni and Paulie go to Italy, so excited for the Italian food?  But once they are there, everything on the menu seems foreign to Paulie?  This is what I imagine some Italians must feel after coming to this pizza joint. \n\nIt is a cute restaurant located in Little Italy, and there are usually lines outside.  It has a family run feel, and has been there since 1948.  There are plenty of selection of both pizzas and pastas.  We sampled both pizzas and pastas, and didn't feel like either were exceptional in any way.  The pizza crust tasted store bought, and the pasta was bland and creamy.  It wasn't what I was hoping for, but maybe that is because everyone has told me that the best pizza in Montreal is found here, and I guess I was a lot disappointed.  And the house-made tiramisu was so wrong, we couldn't even finish it.  \n\nIt is a very family friendly spot, and the service felt uneven.  One other thing, you should BYOW, which again made me feel very very far away from Italy."
24248,4,"visit: 7/14/2011 7pm.\nI am the hamburglar.\nI can't get enough damn hamburgers, I could eat one a day,seriously.\nI heard of this place from my sister who does nothing but rave,wear their shirts, and apparently gets free sodas.\nI thought the 50's motif was pretty cool-seems like the way of the diner has damn near gone the way of the dinosaur,here in Vegas. They have all the decor and look, plus they actually play music from the 50's that everyone is singing in there,lol.\nI was impressed by the extensive menu options, mind you,there aren't many types of things to order,for example:\nSpecialize in a few types of burgers, but tons of available toppings at no extra charge. you can customize your soda, milkshake, malt, coffee, and sundae/banana split. Also they serve fries and onion rings with different dipping sauces.\nI don't know about you, but I am a HUGE SUCKER for variety/choices and this place fit the bill. \n\nour food order:\nMe-1/3 hamburger,done med. pickles,tomato,lettuce,fresh onion.\nhubby-angus cheeplatter with salad,onion rings\nkiddo-fried mac and cheese with carrots and ranch in flaming car!!\n\nAs far as burgers go, we both agreed the outside seemed a little underdone, and I did notice there wasn't any seasoning,but still good.\n\ndrink order:\nme-pear,mango shake a soda,free refills!! 1/2 banana-chocolate-PB shake (half size seemed big, it was as big as my soda!)\nkiddo-birthday cake shake\n\nAll of us tasted each others things and were very pleased. My shake was fricken amazing, and I'm glad I didn't order anything else.I  was stuffed.\n\nI heard of bad reviews mostly consisting of slow service-we had one waiter covering the whole damn store, and he was quick to refill and take away everything. Love it. good job Chris.\n\nFinish the big hamburger and get your pic on the wall when you walk in.\nAn overall really cool place I will definitely return. Just wish it wasn't in BFE"
13498,0,Really should deal with their rotten trash dead animal smell. Haven't been there for a while and hope they improve it.
37427,2,"Ouch. A star was taken away today. I would have loved adding another star to make five, but after some recent and disappointing visits, they fell short. \n\nTheir sandwiches are fantastic! The flavors are delicious! That is, if you can get a sandwich. I went on two Sunday afternoons in a row, early in the afternoon. The first Sunday, my husband and I were the last customers who were able to get a sandwich. Afterwards the employees said matter-of-factly there were no more buns. I felt bad for the other customers waiting in line. On our second visit, we left without sandwiches because they were out of buns. Whoever is in charge of ordering didn't anticipate enough...either week. \n\nThe next issue is the service. The employees didn't seem too thrilled to be working (no hello, how can I help you?, thank you), the interior and communication between employees seemed chaotic (as if they ran out of time to stock the shelves because boxes were scattered in the back hallway leading to the bathrooms or as if they were just opening), and overall I didn't feel welcome or appreciated for my business.   \n\nTo be honest, they would have received 2 stars if it wasn't for the deliciousness of their product. They can easily redeem stars if they improve on their interaction and communication with their customers and have enough product in stock."
28751,3,Love this location!  I created NAKED SUSHI at Geisha House a few years ago and  I'm glad to see they kept it going since I left.  Food is great and the staff are very nice!
13044,1,"The Flamingo is one of the few surviving hotels from the old Vegas days...and it shows. \n\nThere is nothing flashy about the Flamingo. Short of the presence of the casino, it doesn't even feel like Vegas. The Flamingo has become an institution unto itself, and short of getting a free room for my visit, I rarely ever even step foot inside the hotel.\n\nHowever, you cannot justify destroying one of the few remaining icons from old Vegas. Visit the Flamingo if you've never been to Vegas...heck, stay there even. The rooms are decent, but I had a problem with cell phone reception with a pool view room. \n\nNo great restaurants inside of the hotel, but it is close enough to every other hotel that it makes walking the Strip an easy task."
32336,3,"I think this place is a lot of fun.  It's in a nice complex that's not your standard strip mall.\n\nI've been 2x and both times were fun for dates.  They had live music...and a good wine & beer selection (not just bud light).\n\nI have not had too much food so will not comment.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool -  sofa and chairs, a bar...or standard tables.  but, it's a funky cool place.............and we just don't get that too much in Chandler."
27477,1,"Slow ass service in here, like really really slow. I actually started reading the menu I got so bored. All I wanted was some mixed veg noodles. When I got the \""food\"" home I was brutally disappointed. The veg tasted frozen and the noodles were pure mush. \n\nOnly go if nowhere else is open."
22148,0,"Worst service I have ever encountered.  Passive waiters and terrible manager.  With 2 kids in tote, you would think we could have had faster service!    Would NEVER go back."
35707,2,"I'll probably go back.  But I think I would rather have Red Robin over Smashburger.  The only plus: it was cheaper than Red Robin.  And there isn't a Red Robin near my house.\n\nSo after hearing about this place and seeing a few in town (and a couple back in Michigan) my husband and I finally ventured to Smashburger.\n\nI created my own: egg bun, 1/3 burger (you can chose either a 1/3 lb. burger or 1/2 lb burger), tomato, sauteed onions and the smash sauce on the side.  What is smash sauce?  I'm pretty sure its mustard, mayo, pickle relish and not sure what else.  It was ok.  The sauteed onions were so hot that a day later my tongue is still burned.  (-1 star for that)  However, I really liked the meat on the burger.  It had great taste and was juicy.\n\nMy husband ordered the BBQ, Bacon & Cheese, 1/2 lb. burger.  He said that it was good and would go back.\n\nThe fries, called Smash Fries = rosemary, olive oil & garlic.  I could have done without that for sure.  They are different than what you would get anywhere else, but would I order them again?  Probably not.  I also wish they would tell you that the side of fries is enough for sharing (-1 star).  So for two burgers, two fries and two soda's our total was like $21.00.  Not bad at all.\n\nThey have something for everyone (burgers, chicken, hot dogs, salads).  You can order online too!\n\nSomething that I thought was cool, they have a slightly different menu for each city.  For instance, for Las Vegas, they have a burger called Sin City Smashburger.  But if you go to Michigan, they have the Michigan Olive Smashburger and the Michigan Cherry, BBQ, Bacon & Cheese Smashburger.  It looks like they really try to cater to the likes of the state, which is pretty neat.\n\nHere is the link to the Vegas Menu: http://www.smashburger.com/menu_vegas.php"
16659,2,I had the Manhattan Chowder and the seafood jambalaya. Both were pretty good but tasted pretty similar. My bf had the  etouffe and that also was very similar. I didn't try the gumbo although it looked identical to everything else.  Very cute experience. I would go back maybe if I had another Cajon craving since this is the only place in vegas I've found. It's a decent place to eat but if u compare it to real Cajun food than u will be a little disappointed.
38069,3,"Let me get the logic behind Secret Pizza.  They're opened to 4-5 a.m.  The drunk and partially drunk slur their way in to get that \""sober me up munchies\"" on.  Wouldn't you want a sign up to attract more customers?  How passively cruel is that to the wobbly and incoherent?   Wandering like zombies seeking to feed, one could only chuckle at the priceless visual as they search for Secret Pizza.  \n\nContrarians (sober people) would say signs would defeat the purpose of their marketing goal...it wouldn't be called SECRET PIZZA...logic is never logic if drunk.\n\nThrough the corridor on the right of the Japanese restaurant within the Cosmopolitan, you'll find Secret Pizza.  There I said it.  If that's not enough, you're probably too drunk to even eat.  Within this hallway is a massive collection of interesting prints of musicians.  I think they were musicians.  The pizza aroma pulled my attention away from the pictures.    \n\nMy monstrous hunger, which developed from searching the menu, told me to get two slices.  Give up looking for a poster board list menu or what have you.  Just ask, because there are none.  Peering down through the glass, I eventually chose the meat lovers and the cheese with white sauce.  \n\nPizzas are the thin crust.  My crusts were a tad burnt on the edges after the oven warm up; each crispy bite was filled with a healthy (so to speak) dose of cheese and ingredients.  Both slices were delicious.  Both had surprisingly good taste considering since they were just thrown into an oven and reheated for a minute.  \n\nNo time for a sit down dinner, want a quick slice (or whole pizza), or need some grease to relieve your drunkenness.  Secret Pizza can be a strong option.  That is, if you can find it."
4720,2,"Friends from So Cal were visiting and wanted to come here.  One of them is a FOB Vietnamese (she calls herself that!) and has dined here before.  Her boyfriend also loves the place and so do I, so we had lunch yesterday.\n\nI had the Beef Fried Rice, she had I the Sweet & Sour Pork Chops, and I don't know what her boyfriend had, but it looked good.  All of the dishes were excellent.  We didn't leave hungry, that's for sure!\n\nThe only strike against this place is that the servers here seem so unfriendly.  They don't say hello, have a mean look on their face all the time, and when my friend asked for chopsticks, the server gave her a mean look and pointed to the chopsticks on the table....she obviously didn't see it, but it was the way he handled it that was shocking.  The funny part is that she's Vietnamese, so you would think they would treat Gringo's like that, but not their own....whatever.  They only get 3 Stars because of the service.\n\nWill I return?  Pho-gettah 'bout it, of course!"
38263,4,Don't miss out on this place.\nI had simple soft chicken tacos and the flavor was out of this world. \nThe beans and rice are incredibly fresh and delicious.
33501,4,"from the 22 untill the 27 I had the pleasure of staying at the cosmo a treat for my 50 birthday we had an amazing time the room,the service was all 5 stars the best meal came from stk service and atmosphere wonderful I was up on the 67 floor in a one bedroom terrace the hotel located right in the middle of the strip get a bus pass and take the duece any where allday up in down the strip. Now the only one downfall was when we checked in which went really quick they asked us for a 750 deposit that we get back we had already paid for the room so thought that was odd but with no charges to room you do get it back all except a 28 dollar aday fee but a wonderful experiece"
30082,2,"Upon walking in the place is beautiful... (as it should be) only having been open since mid-December. My cousin and I came here for brunch one morning and I ordered a coffee and she had a Bloody Mary. Both drinks were good (I got a whole pitcher of coffee at the table so I could refill it as I desired). \n\nShe ordered a Croque Madame and was pleased with it. I had a Caesar Salad with chicken and one of their \""specials\"", mushroom risotto. I absolutely love risotto! So I was very disappointed when it came out runny and flavorless. I took a few bites, wrapped it up and brought it home for my boyfriend to eat. He happened to like it so maybe I'm biased and just prefer my risotto's a little thicker with more flavor. \n\nMy three stars are for the risotto. The service was great and everything but the risotto was satisfactory. Everything else was good... but nothing I would write home about."
38086,2,"Ok.. the pizza here is good... but I don't understand the hype! My friends always want Secret Pizza whenever we go to Vegas.. but WHY... \n\nTo me.. Secret Pizza is just pizza... nothing special.. but if I had to recommend something, the white pizza is the best out of all the other ones I've tried here. \n\nConveniently located in Cosmo for those of you who like Marquee Day/Night club.. I guess it's something you should at least try once. But don't have too high expectations!"
21430,4,"Awesome desserts , wide variety , decent price!"
43763,3,"I really enjoy the brunch here. It's good though it has a bit too much of a hipster vibe. The food is not amazingly stand out, though the beignets I recently had were pretty amazing.\n\nIt's a nice place for a casual lunch as well if you have the time. During the week it can be a bit busy for lunch though so be warned."
23653,3,"When it's a Tuesday night, and Cadillac Ranch is in dive-bar mode, I like it a lot. Chill music, nice patio, great specials on beer. Since the bar was outdoors, my pals didn't have wander off to have a smoke.\n\nWeeknight specials are awesome. $3 pints of some good stuff like Mission Blonde Ale. I can relax here, and the interior looks so nice I'll definitely come back during peak hours. I'm a fan."
8233,4,"Dirty Dogg Saloon is a place you'll never forget. From amazing drink prices, the awesome swinging and dancing bartenders, and to the fantastic music mix unforgettable is the word that comes to mind.  It gets packed and the weekends so you want to get there early to make sure you get a seat. The bartenders start dancing at 10 but with a little persuasion you can get them up there before then.  Great staff, fun customers, and all around good time!"
28982,4,"It doesn't matter if you're a tourist or a long-time local, the fountains at Bellagio are a must see.\n\nThe show happens every half hour starting at 3pm and and goes well into the evening.  Each half hour has a different song usually something classy (Sinatra), dramatic (Bocelli), romantic (Dion) or fun (Pink Panther).  Each song has it's own special water choreography making use of the entire faux lake in front of Bellagio.\n\nEven though the show starts in the afternoon, you must come back at night.  The lit up water with the backdrop of the strip might be the most beautiful thing you see in Vegas.  For five minutes your mind can take a break from the artificial city and take in this awesome free work of art.  And since Bellagio attracts an international crowd, it's really cool to see people of all walks of life come together to appreciate it.\n\nI guess the only thing I would change is maybe try something with more modern tunes.  Still, the fountains are more than deserving of five stars."
45581,4,"Reliable, trustworthy auto shop! \nTook my Dodge Ram 1500 in for an evaluation, which was free. Another shop stated I need to have my rack & pinon replaced, radiator was leaking, thermostat was stuck open, and the  temp sensor was bad. Wanted to charge a lot to repair all items, $1500.00.\nI always get second and third opinions and I'm glad I did.  Yelped auto shops in Goodyear, called and was able to get in the next day. Phil was the one that looked over my truck and was very honest. Said that he wouldn't recommend the rack & pinon replacement because the leak was dried up, no wet dirt. Plus most rack & pinon do leak at first. He also said that the sensor was not bad and that the thermostat was the issue and that I did need a radiator since it was leaking.\nIn all, the write up was very reasonable and I went ahead with the work. Had it back by the end of the day.\nI will definitely be having this shop perform ALL maintenance on my vehicles!\nThanks so much for your honestly Litchfield Auto Repair"
32121,3,Sometimes when I try a new place (for us) with a Groupon I come away disappointed. Not at My Arepa. I haven't had Venezuelan food before so I'm not comparing but this is a really nice place. The server (owner?) is so nice explains the foods and combinations. The foods is tasty although less spicy than I expected. Next time we're in the area we'll go again.
17097,0,"I have been to Loco Patron a handful of times, the food and service have always been mediocre at best. The only thing it has going for it, is that, it is dead on Thursday nights to watch Thursday night football.  This past Thursday (12/4/14) was no expectation. Let me just say, that I have been in the service industry my whole adult life. I've done everything from washing dishes,  hosting, serving, and bartending. I get it. Off days happen. I don't think this was the case.  Our server was....awful. She barely acknowledged us and was inconvenienced to tell us what beers were on draft. When our good arrived, 75% of the orders were wrong. Instead of shredded beef, we all got ground beef. Not a big deal. I'm still going to eat it, but she never came by to ask how everything was. We sat there with empty beer glasses and greasy ground beef. When she saw that we were finished with our food, she handed us our tab and never cleared the table. We paid our bill and apparently she couldn't wait for us to leave to pick up the back book. She opened it up in front of us before we even had a chance to sign the slip. I have NEVER written a bad review before and NEVER tipped less the 20%. I just think that bad service and attitudes shouldn't be enabled. Oh and I forgot to mention the ear piercing full bass techno music that was playing  during the game. Sure it's the bears and the cowboys, I personally could care less, but those are somebody else's teams that want to hear what's going on.  Come on Loco Patron, get it together!"
9782,1,It's a kool spot I guess.. But I've been going there for a few yrs now and the staff is great but the food is good at best but not great and this place is slowly getting worse.. Bathrooms are never clean if you show up at 7am but wish them well but I've given more than enough money to this place and its not getting better.. Sorry guys
46779,4,What an amazing night! Myself and my wife celebrated our 1 year anniversary here and what a great choice. My wife loves a new menu experience and Virtu has that plus amazing drinks. Great BandB and awesome ambience.
8051,4,"Elizabeth is an outstanding stylist! I came to her with orange hair, because my last dye job was horrendous and I attempted to fix it myself. I walked into the salon and she was the only stylist there and with a client. I was in tears. I only waited a moment before Elizabeth acknowledged me. She was kind, knowledgeable, professional and available to help me the following day. Its rare to find a hair stylist in Old Town Scottsdale that care as much as the stylists do in this salon. Color correction, cuts, Brazilian Blowouts, you name it, this lady does it! And it didn't cost me my first born either! Scottsdale precision and perfection without the Scottsdale cost. This salon has a cool unpretentious vibe as well...Its worth checking out!!"

35867,1,Im letzten Jahr sind wir etliche Male dort Hessen und es war sehr gut. In diesem Sommer jedoch war weder das Essen noch der Service auf dem Niveau wie wir es kannten. Es hat sehr lang gedauert bis das Essen fertig war und dann war dieses geschmacklich ziemlich fad und langweilig. Schade eigentlich
37114,2,"This is the nearest place for me to buy Boba when I feel like having one. Not bad. It takes a very long time for them to make one shake. I went to Smith's to buy a few things I needed, went back to the cafe and they were not yet done.  Their swirl potato chip on a stick is really good. I think they are over priced. Overall,  I still go there to buy my boba."

33426,0,What a disappointment. Had shellac manicure and a pedicure. I could have done a better job on my pedi and the shellac mani which usually lasts two weeks began chipping within the day. This place is an incredible rip off!

11778,1,"I love to cook. I go to new restaurants all the time to get inspiration for new things to try in my own kitchen. I didn't get much from Tommy Bahama's Scottsdale restaurant. We arrived for our reservation a few minutes early, checked in with the hostess, and my companion was escorted to the upstairs dining room while I parked the car. I joined her shortly and found that she had been seated in the walled \""back\"" part of the dining room, that frankly looks like an afterthought to the much more pleasant and amply windowed main area. Not much of a view from here. But, the decor was very pleasant, and we set about ordering lunch.\n\nFirst, we had Tommy's Coconut Shrimp appetizer, billed as \""World Famous\"". Nicely presented, crispy coconut, and a slightly too sweet papaya-mango chutney dipping sauce accompanied four good size, juicy shrimp. A good start! For lunch, we ordered the BBQ pork Habana Cabana sandwich and the South Beach Cuban sandwich.\n\nWhen the Cuban sandwich arrived, it was accompanied by a \""slaw\"" of sorts that included chunks of orange, and slices of fennel bulb in a non-descript dressing. The combination of anise and orange just didn't work for me. Besides, the fennel was sliced across the width of the bulb, making relatively large  horseshoe shaped strips that were difficult to spear on the fork and even harder to fit in my mouth gracefully without cutting them individually. The Cuban sandwich was totally unimaginative. The \""roasted pork tenderloin\"" looked to be the identical shredded pork that was the basis of my companion's BBQ pork sandwich minus the BBQ sauce and was somewhat dry. A few slices of what looked and tasted like supermarket deli ham were layered with some cheese and a big slice of sour pickle on a diagonally cut bun that was soggy from the ham inside and crunchy dry on the outside. \n\nMy companion's BBQ sandwich had an ample amount of shredded pork that had apparently been tossed in a thick dark sauce and piled on a nicely toasted round bun. Plain French fries accompanied the sandwich. On first bite, she immediately commented on how overly sweet the sauce was, so I tasted a little sample and had to agree. No offsetting acidity to the sugary blackberry brandy BBQ sauce that smothered the meat. Too bad too, because it mostly covered up the flavor of what appeared to be  a nice smoky meat and left a sticky sweet aftertaste instead of nice smoky BBQ.\n\nOur server was friendly, personable, and efficient. The food runner took away or forks as he cleared the appetizer plates and delivered the sandwiches, but did not come with new, so we had to flag down our server and wait for forks as lunch cooled. All-in-all, it wasn't the kind of lunch experience I expected for nearly $60 (no alcohol) including tip. Great location, lovely decor, but missing some really important points when it comes to the total experience. Lastly, for whatever reason, they subsequently reported us to Open Table as a \""no-show\"". Nice."
2404,2,"Never been to a Boston Market?  \n\nThey basically have roasted chicken and a variety of sides.  You go up to the front counter and choose what to eat - it's all laid out there in front for you to see.\n\nPay, sit down and eat.\n\nI like roasted chicken - here, it's not too bad.  A little better flavor than your hot roasted chicken that you'd find at your supermarket.\n\nThe sides are pretty good, too.  Not great, it should hit the spot.\n\nI'll never forget how one pecular employee at one particular location welcomed me as I walked into the door - he hollered \""Welcome to BM!\""  I won't tell you what type of grin I had while eating my lunch."
23403,0,Tried to get a table. On a Wednesday had a ridiculous wait because they wouldn't seat a table of two at a table for four. (75 minutes with tables for 3-4 sitting open!!!!) it's summer in phoenix! What are they waiting for to put butts in their seats. No matter. I left and went to Stingray who got me in with no incident at 7pm.
35642,4,"We came with a party of 9, and they were very accommodating.  I got the Miso Ramen, which comes with the thick, curly noodles.  The regular Tonkotsu ramen comes with the thin noodles, which I don't really like, so read the descriptions carefully.  I added corn to my ramen, and it was perfect!  We also shared some gyoza and fried rice.  The gyoza is ok, but the fried rice had lots of green onions.  \n\nYes, this place is small, but the crowd just shows how great the food and service is here.  We got to sit at the counter and watch the guys make all the food.  It was the best seat in the house!"
44983,0,This place is horrible!!! The groomers were so rude and unprofessional when I walked in. Then to top it off a groomer by the name of Allison chopped the hair on my dogs ear off. Did not even say anything to me about it until I got my dog home and noticed it. If she cut just a little more she would have cut the tip of his hair off. For 50$ and to be in Tivoli Village (nicer Las Vegas) it was not worth it! service grooming and groomers suck and the place it self is not even up to par. I would NOT recommend anyone to take there dog here. I only ranked it one star because I had to if it was up to me NO STARS.
46144,1,Had a couple of their famous fish tacos. Very pricey for the food you get. The tacos were mostly cabbage. They even used the core of the cabbage which was bitter. On the good side their fish was very tasty just not enough. For the price Tortilla Fish has them beat no contest.
27171,2,"Again a restaurant I would never ever think of eating in but as a place to let loose its rather famous!\n\nKey point to be aware \n\n- the only measures they have are double\n- their mojitos have three shots of rum (dark, gold, white)\n- a jacket left lying around will grow feet and walk away\n\nThe music is awesome for letting go of a Friday and welcoming the weekend. The pole at the back of the dance floor is something to be visited for sure for amusement!\n\nBe ware of the bouncers..... they arent that bright and can be heavy handed!\n\nGood times!"
35696,3,"Ate here tonight because we were shopping at the RV dealer.  It's our second time.  The line was very long and we waited a very long time to order.  However, the prep guy was very friendly, apologizing for the wait and trying to make the best of it.  It was also super hot in the line, we were hot and hungry standing there.  I ordered a half pound of chicken and added pickles and jalepenos on it with mac and cheese salad and potato salad.  Everything tasted great.  The side salads were really really good and the chicken, although the bone/connector joint thingys kept getting in my way, the sauces kept me happy.  All of the sauces made the chicken sing harmonies in my mouth.  It was pricey but I had leftovers for later.  Boyfriend got the brisket and raved about it being juicy and delicious.  My only complaint is the wait in line.  They need more help."
17526,2,"One of the ol' school sushi joints in Vegas, these guys are doing an OK job. I was told by one of the owners that they were the originators of what is known as \""Las Vegas sushi\"" I can neither confirm nor deny this claim.\n\nCame here with a bunch of peoples who were on the lookout for some AYCE sushi. After we came in, we were shown to our seats in which they used banquet chairs. The tables are a little smallish for 4 peoples but we were able to squeeze in. I had to hold my breath.\n\nNow off to the AYCE. Everything was good, some standouts include the tuna karai, the coconut shrimp which tasted like TGIFridays version, and salmon kama.\n\nOne thing though the service was inconsistent. Sometimes they were thoughtful, other times, I had to flag down a server several times to refill our water.\n\nAnother note, the portion size was a little bit too big for AYCE. Normally, I complain when a business is too stingy. But for AYCE, I wish they were smaller so that I could of had a chance to try the nigiri, and other rolls. \n\nI would come back here as a fallback in case bluefin was too packed. But it is what it is, so next time take care of yourself.. And each other."
10537,1,"I have stayed at the Alexis twice before this last attempted reservation.\n\nThe first time was for the Nine Inch Nails concert being held across the street at the Hard Rock Casino.  For the money the room and facilities were okay.  The bathroom tub was a mess however.  The room that visit was quiet and having an outside entrance helped keep the noise to a minimum.  They did have several pools and the inside court areas were nice and well maintained.\n\nThe second visit the check in was very slow, they couldn't find the reservation and want to provide a room on an upper floor with only one bed instead of the two I had originally reserved.  The carpet in the room was very dirty, my sock feet were black in about 3 minutes without my shoes.  The furniture in the room had dust around the drawers and was in pretty bad shape. With a fee of $50 for the room I guess that you cannot complain.  They did deliver extra toilet paper and towels promptly when requested.\n\nThe last reservation was a total screw up.  I called the resort directly and was quoted one price in one phone call.  Then I called back a few minutes later the rate was over $30 more; the reason was that the average for two nights; with one high rate and one lower rate, was the average that was quoted.\n\nCheck in was a nightmare.  The hotel was packed with a convention that I had not been informed of.  They would not adjust the rates as quoted on the phone originally.  I had booked two beds they gave me a king.  They had no parking anywhere near the room, and several other people staying at the hotel were also complaining of the lack of parking for registered guest.\n\nWith all the problems at check and the wrong type room being assigned.  I were back to the front desk and told them to cancel my reservation and credit my card back for the entire amount.  This lead to over thirty minutes of waiting for their manager on duty to do anything and a major confrontation to get the full refund.  This was even after the manager told me they were booked full and people were waiting to get a room while I was trying to get my refund.\n\nThe manager on duty was very hostile and repeated told me it was an early check out and she was going to told back a fee.  This lead to another round of discussion and was told I could take it up with her supervisor in three days when she returned to work. \n\nI found this last visit to the Alexis to more that I wanted to deal with and do not plan on returning to this hotel again.  The staff have always appeared cool and acted more like its a job they have to do instead of providing higher quality service to their clients.\n\nAlso guest at this facility have to pay an additional $12 fee per computer or internet device that you use for each 24 hour period.  This meant $48 extra plus tax for each visit that we stayed on top of the hotel fees.  The menu for the restaurant is limited but they will serve you an overpriced drink of any type.\n\nThe front desk and service personnel could use some quality training on handling guest and providing services to clients; plus additional staff or check in and check out as the wait is entirely too long."
47143,4,"I hired Skyler and the Myriad team for their Real Estate Investment advisory services and it continues to put a positive cash flow in my bank every month!! I knew I wanted to invest in real estate but there were so many different options and opinions. It seemed like everyone I talked to was their own personal expert and quite frankly it was overwhelming and stressful. Skyler and his team were a breath of fresh air! These guys were young but experienced. Smart but fun! And most importantly, they were laser focused on producing results. They helped me analyze my current situation, understand the risks and rewards with different real estate investment scenarios and most importantly, taught me how to understand the numbers.

20645,0,"The birthday boy cried... And he's 29!! What a mess!!\nTheir hiring process must include a Plinko Board. \n\nBottom Line First: Buffalo Wild Wings has boring food that apparently takes 12 minutes per wing to prepare, a crap beer selection, which is way over prices,  and customer service training comparable to the Nevada Highway Patrol. \n\nIf you like wings, don't eat here.\nIf you like your friends and family, don't bring them here.\n\nMy next Yelp!

I ordered to go, as I had to leave the party for work. I even paid when I ordered. Our server, shorted my  change and still stressed that gratuity was not included in my total. I didn't make a big deal over it. Every time she came over, she said that mine should be right out. I wanted to cancel it, but again, did not want to make a scene.\n\nI pointed out a bag that had been sitting by the register for 20 minutes. It turns out that this WAS my order. She had it remade, which made me really uncomfortable. \n\nShe tried to make a joke out of it, not understanding how difficult it is for me to not be mean sometimes. She did not offer to refund the food cost or offer anything additional either, she just said \""well you have somewhere to be, so get out of here.\""\n\nThe food, which I had to eat on my rushed drive was spilled all over the bag and was not hot. The napkins in the bag were soaked from the spilled sauce. It was the typical, half-assed Buffalo Wild Wing garbage food with no veggie sides.\n\n(I will spell check this later)"
40091,4,"This is Zan- Janet's wife.  I just got back from getting my hair done with Vee at Hair Nirvana.  After much dread in trying to find a stylist I can trust out here in Scottsdale, I can happily say; I found him!  When I first found him here on Yelp, after pages and pages of stereotypical \""Scottsdale Salons,\"" I knew I had found something special.  The salon itself is also a store, filled with organic hair products, fair trade products- many handmade by refugee Tibetan monks, products handcrafted by Native Americans he knows and purchases from directly, and more.  It's a beautiful little shop, and my wife Janet- who is an SGI Buddhist- enjoyed browsing while Vee tended to my hair.  \n\nNow, I'm painfully shy and socially awkward, and I always dread having to find someone new to do my hair- but the moment I walked in and Vee greeted me, I felt at ease.  Perhaps a little too much, as my nerdy rambling quickly took over the conversation.  He's a genuine, friendly guy that can make you feel as if you've known him for years.  I could totally picture him hanging out with my motley crew of friends and fitting right in with us weirdos (in a good way).  That aside, I went in only for a cut... but he had a fantastic deal on touching up my highlights, I simply had to take advantage of it.  My hair looks fantastic, smells even better, and I look 10 years younger.  The fact that he is such a stickler for natural, organic and sulfate free products makes me respect and like him even more.  I hate having my photo taken, but wanted to include a photo of how great my hair looks, anyway.  That's how much I love what he did.  He truly listened to exactly what I wanted, and did exactly as I asked- but made it look even better than I had pictured it in my head.  A win-win.  I'll be back to Vee from now on... I am a new, loyal client.  Thanks, Vee!"
23272,1,"The only time it is justifiable to go to the Blue Martini is during happy hour and even then the wait sometimes makes it not worth the half price martinis. \n\nOne birthday, I thought it would be a great idea to try half of their martinis in one night. The signature blue martini is delicious, if you like an AMF, you would love this drink. Most of their martinis are just variations of mixed drinks. The only one that I would suggest avoiding is the Almond Joy because the coconut irritated my throat. \n\nThe food here is nothing special. If you can hold out, go to Yardhouse for dinner and beer at their happy hour. Remember, beer before liquor never been sicker. Liquor before beer, you're in the clear."
40822,0,"Good service, decor is OK, food is just not good. There are probably 10 places in town for better tapas. Would never waste my time going back."
909,1,"It's a place that is easy to both love and hate. On one hand they have some unique academic programs and great professors, but you'll probably have to slog through lots sub-par classes before you get the good classes. \n\nBusiness is one of the \""better\"" colleges, but you wouldn't know if from the lower level classes. My least favorite class ever was an upper level econ (econ is technically in LAS even though business people spend plenty of time in the department) class that was taught by a TA who not only didn't speak very good English, but who also gave really harsh tests. The first test average was a 64% and there was no curve. Grading is harsh here! Lots of people repeat classes. I also have plenty of bad things to say about accounting and finance classes, but it depends on the class I guess. \n\nLAS is the catch-all college that gets shafted a lot. Many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart. Contrast that with the much-funded engineering college's glittering shiny collection of brand new giant buildings. Oh well. \n\nACES, my college, is a bit of a catch-all college as well, but some of the majors are quite small. I've had my smallest and favorite classes in ACES. For development and other niche economics specialties this is the place to be and undergrads get lots of attention. It also has top-notch programs in other aggy stuff ranging from food science to animal science. I adore most of my professors I have had in this college. The only downside is that ACES has tended to attract some less than bright students in the past and has some programs within it in need of reform, but I'm sure that is true in many UIUC colleges.  I recommend ACES, but only if you are truly interested in the curricula. \n\nI would note that I skipped all gen-eds and a lot of ugly giant lower level classes thanks to APs and placements tests. If you can do that, it is worth it, because the upper level classes are where you can really enjoy academics. The lower level classes seem to be purposefully soul-crushing, with harsh curves, unintelligible TAs, and professors who just read off powerpoints. 101 classes are where learning goes to die. I basically did well on them by memorizing lectures off flashcards, a sad way to \""learn\"" if you ask me. Don't be afraid to switch classes if you get a bad feeling on the first day. I did that a lot and it was worth it for the English-speaking TAs. \n\nI am personally not a fan of the Greek system, which welds a little too much power here. The drunken anti-intellectual environment can be stifling if you don't find a niche. Allen Hall is the place to be for anti-Greeks/hippies/outsiders and it has the bonus of small lower level classes often taught by people who actually care. Avoid the isolated residence halls like PAR and FAR, go six-pack only if you are Greek-ish, and ISR is the place to be for engineers and other assorted people who want to live near the science and engineering buildings. Dorm food is a mixed bag...it's mostly just inexcusably bad, but most people don't seem to notice because they think fries and hot dogs= acceptable lunch. \n\nI like the Chambana area, even if it has some minor annoyances. Ill-kept frat houses and a bizarre lack of on-campus grocery stores mar it, but otherwise it was easy for me to find restaurants to eat at and assorted drunk-free places to hang out. However, I can think of about ten major cities where I'd rather live.\n\nThe weather here is horrible. In the summer you scald and in the winter you freeze, so pack your snowboots and your short-shorts."
2764,1,"I was there on Friday night about 9:00.  Not very many people and it seems that this place is short staffed.  No hostess, and only 2 servers for this large place.  My server was very good - he gets high marks!  The food was another story.\n\nI ordered the lemon sole, a side salad and that's all.  With tax and tip the meal came to $20.00.  The salad was nice and fresh and crisp.  The lemon caper sauce was tasty, the sole was not very good.  I did mention this to the server and he offered to replace it, but I didn't want to wait.  It was supposed to be \""saut\u00e9ed\"", the chef does not know how to cook fish!  It was fried and was crispy and tough.  Sole is a tender fish and doesn't need much cooking.  I was very disappointed in this dish and would not recommend it.  \n\nAs always, Mimi's does have good bread, but the rest of the food is not so hot.  This was what I thought a rather expensive meal (well not a lot, but more than $5 or 10!) and way not worth it.  Go elsewhere!"
44370,2,"Went here for the first time with my mom yesterday for a Sunday brunch. We went there around 12:30 and it wasn't too crowded--we got seated immediately.\n\nI had a hankering for corned beef and hash, so that's what I ordered. Unfortunately it wasn't quite what I was expecting...at other brunch places I've been to, the corned beef and hash browns are cooked and served together, but here the corned beef was served with scrambled eggs on top, and the hash browns were on the side. I was a bit disappointed by that.\n\nOther than the disappointing food, everything else was great. Service was prompt, our food came out quickly, and our server stopped by our table multiple times to inquire about our meal."
21031,0,"The coffee is mediocre and way over-priced.  The service is terribly slow and occasionally wrong. Never order a sandwich from them as it can take forever and is extremely over-priced. I once ordered a sandwich from them for around $6.00. They then proceeded to forget out me and making the sandwich. Then they realized it 5 minutes later and made my sandwich (which took another 5 minutes). Then they gave it to me without an apology.\n\nBevande seems to survive based on the convenience factor for desperate Computer Scientists. I wish Siebel would get a better coffee shop. I prefer Espresso Royale, Paradiso or Cafe Kopi for my money."
31607,2,"Food and drinks are expensive, and in all honesty not really worth the price.  They're pretty much just regular hot dogs with over the top toppings.  You can count on long lines and hunting for a place to seat. And they've got nothing on my all time favorite hot dogs, Flo's in Cape Neddick, Maine."
22522,2,"I've GOT to be honest and say I went for their Bread Basket!  Best ever! Went on my Birthday two years in a row.  First year Everything was 5 star. Second year? Must have hit an \""off night\"".  Poor service and mediocre food, except for the BREAD!"
14417,1,"Meh is right\n\nI had high expectations.  It smelled delicious from the outside.\n\nI love thin crust pizza.  I love fresh ingredients.  I love brick oven pizza.  I should have LOVED this place.\n\nUnfortunately, I thought it was the epitomy of bland.  \n\nI got a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.\nThe toppings were not evenly spread across the pizza.  In fact, half of the pizza had no pepperoni and a few pieces of sausage on them?! (I hate sausage on pizza, blech)\n\nThe sauce was sooo bland to me.  \n\nThe cheese almost had the consistency of low-fat cheese when it melts... like... rubbery.\n\nYep.  I won't come back."
17272,2,"Pros:\n1.  Great sushi - always fresh and I've never had a less than fabulous meal there.\n2.  Great staff.  Honest.  Attentive.  Always happy to see you.\n\nCons:\n1.  For a neighborhood joint,  FAR too expensive for a weekday meal when it's not happy hour or \""double down\"".  Generally we stick to the happy hour or double-down.\n2.  Can get loud when some of the regulars show up.  Not too keen on enjoying the delicacies of ahi tuna and cold sake when there's high-fives all around and stories of 'some broad I banged that I met at Cafe Portobello'  A little odd, but that may have been a bad couple of nights that we were there.\n\nUPDATE:\nI went there this evening.\nPrices are still high, but the double-down helps keep things economical.\n\nSushi rolls are SUPER THIN and even the bartender thought so as well.  I'll include a photo.  (oops, guess I can't)\n\nBut a single slice of one roll is equivalent to half a roll slice at other sushi bars I've gone to.  I'd have to say it was comical! :)"

47299,4,I had Juan at Snail Motorsports install my Eisenmann Race exhaust on my 2008 BMW M5.  He did a fantastic job and treated my car as if it was his own. He took great care of my baby.  I would highly recommend his shop!
21290,1,"Went there saturday night and the waitress was horrible, horrible, horrible.  She was snotty, rude and should not be working with customers.  It took an hour to get our food which were only apps and 2 hamburgers.  The food was good but my hamburger was on the cold side.  We all assumed that the food was probably sitting around for awhile.  If you want crappy service this is the place for you."
38478,2,The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere was delightful.  However the food was just OK and somewhat overpriced.
11278,2,"Sushi Mon isn't bad, but I'd rather go to Oyshi or Yama. The selection of food is not as great as either Oyshi or Yama for all you can eat. However, I like that they have daily specials. Often times, Sushi Mon offers toro, which is not offered at many other AYCE sushi places. The staff is friendly, the bathroom clean, and the food fresh.\n\nTip: don't forget to ask for the stamp card. After enough all you can eat stamps, you get one free."
49058,1,"I've been coming here for the past year, every week at first and now every few months and never again. They used the worst cuts of meat in their sunsal-tao chicken and put way more salad than fries. When I asked the waitress to take back the salad and give me more fries, she said, Sorry, it's already been made.\"" How stingy! And this after ordering and paying for extra pieces of chicken and giving her a generous tip! It's too bad because I really like the owner of the place. Best not to come here when it's busy (Saturday night and in summer for some reason), because quality of food and service goes down."
21242,0,"Can whomever is in charge of parking for First Friday put down the bong? So I followed the advice on their website and went to the Old City Hall Parking Garage...which was empty! For free parking for First Friday I expected to see cars! And a shuttle! But no...only a handful of cars and not a shuttle to be seen...you gotta walk to El Cortez to catch a shuttle. And when you make it over there a 40 minute wait for a shuttle is routine. \n\nRather than write another chapter of War & Peace, here's the quickie version. \nParking: Not well thought out. At all. Quite frankly it sucks. \nShuttle: Pain in the rear to get to, cool as heck to ride, route they take makes no sense.  \nArt: Please show me some art! Paintings! Sketches! Not flea market crap I can find off an exit ramp along the Interstate in Arizona. ART!!!! LOCAL ARTISTS!!! If you have First Friday in the Arts District for Pete's sake have some dang ART!!!!\nFood Trucks: I wanted to check out SlidinThru and see if I could give them a second chance. The line made me say that's not going to happen. The food truck placement is working a bit too well to draw traffic. \nSecurity: When someone moves an art car and 8 LVMPD officers show up it might be a sign you're a bit overstaffed on security. \nLive Music: Thank you Skull Candy for headphones that work well as it drowned out the screech fest. Before I turned them on...what I heard was not good.\n\nIn short First Friday is slipping. And even with Zappos throwing money at it...it's not enough. The people running this just don't get it. Tony Hsieh and Co. would be better off paying to ship the FF leadership to other cities just once to see how it's done. \n\n1 Star: Because I regret wasting time to go to this one! It SERIOUSLY SUCKED."
42616,3,"Went for dinner on a Saturday with 7pm reservations.  There were several empty tables around us but they quickly filled up.  Nice decor and a comfortable setting.  From the Bank of America parking garage, go through the doors near the elevators on Level 6.  A short walk takes you to a down escalator that puts you at the upstairs entrance.\n\nThe food was very good and our server, Matt, was very helpful as we navigated the menu.  His knowledge of the menu was on point as he explained the differences in the red wine reductions served over the duck breast and beef short ribs.  (Duck breast sauce more sweet and short ribs sauce more savory.)\n\nWe shared the charcuterie sampler (3 meats, 2 cheeses and crostini served with olives and hot mustard.)  We made our selections from both the standard menu and the daily menu, which included sopresatta and salami.  A great appetizer for sharing.\n\nOur entrees were the braised beef short ribs and the salmon.  The ribs were tender and flavorful.  The preparation of the salmon was very simple (seasoned and grilled) but was executed perfectly.  We had sides of pan fried corn and yukon puree and both were excellent.  The portion sizes of the sides were sufficient for two.\n\nIn summary, great food and great service.  Can be a bit pricey when you start adding sides.  But we will definitely go back."
15894,4,"Come for the Dim Sum.  Arrived 11am and it was fairly busy.  Full of Asian families taking their time and enjoying themselves.\n\nAmbience - Clean, well lit and noisy like most Dim Sum places.  Open kitchen which is somewhat unusual and a good thing.\n\nPrice - Ordered 1 A item and 4 B items plus 2 Tsin Dao beers ($7) for a total lunch of $22.38.\n\nService - Funny start when they tried to make me take a menu (I'm only part asian so I guess they wanted to make me order ala carte food).  After that it was good.  The hostess seated me right away and the food carts rotate quickly and consistently.  I hardly finished each plate and it was whisked away.  Busboy offered me a second beverage before I had to ask anyone for another.\n\nFood - Excellent selection sorted by food types: baked and fried goods, steamed goods, large sides (like fried rice), dessert and fresh beverage.\n\nPork Shui Mai - Good flavor but slightly chewy (like a typical chicken texture).\n\nBBQ Pork Bun Baked (Char Sui Bao) - Perfect bun texture and flavor with a tasty glaze coating (your hands will get sticky).  Stuffing of bbq pork was tasty.\n\nPork Dumpling (gau style not pot sticker) - Must have! great crispy dough contrasts with lightly chewy stuffing.  Lightly sweet flavor is delicate and delicious.\n\nChar Sui Bao steamed - Great flavor but dough wasn't my favorite (stick to the baked ones).\n\nShrimp dumpling (Har Gau) - Good sized value with sticky wrapper and delicately spiced shrimp filling.  Each one must have at least two 10-12 shrimps in it.\n\nDidn't try the fried rice, dessert cart or the fresh juice cart (soup or beverage?).  They also paraded around an asparagus plate that looked and smelled wonderful but I was too full.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality and value of this place and would recommend it.  I'm picky about Dim Sum and this place does a decent job on everything I tried and better than average with the Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Ha Gau."
26850,1,"I like to think of Petal has \""hit or miss.\""  Lately it has been a miss.  I feel like I can try on like 6-10 things and nothing will work- it won't fit right, too see through, etc.\n\nAlso, every time I am in there I feel rushed in the dressing room.  They are constantly trying to take things out (I assume for shoplifting reasons).  But I hate feeling so rushed."
13267,2,"This is a real let-down of a Steakhouse.  Are they even serving Prime Beef?  I really hope so, but can't tell from their steaks.\n\nThat being said, their Kobe burger is pretty good for lunch, and you can get sushi as your side.  Talk about a decadent Vegas lunch.  It's my signature."

My main concern being the chairs and tables... Not very kid-safe...\n\nI am not sure how I feel about this place, it's cute, perhaps I will give it another go soon... \n\nStay tuned Yelp"
48919,0,Wait times seem rather longer than usual. Made a basic order and took rather long for them to still get it wrong. Employees definitely don't want to be there and show it. Some even tell you when you ask them how they are doing. Seemed like a rather new location and wanted to try it out. Been twice since it opened and both times were slow and messed something up in my order. I'll just look for another place to stop on my way to the office.
19027,2,"I had not been to an Applebee's in over a year until tonight. My family lives out in Queen Creek and our options around there are very limited. We decided tonight on this Applebee's because it was fairly close and the wait was way to long at the Native New Yorker in Queen Creek. \n\nThe food was okay. Not bad but not great. The beer prices are great. The service was good. I had jalapeno lime shrimp with rice which had good flavor. My sister had lemon butter fettuccine alfredo with shrimp which she enjoyed. I had not been to an Applebee's in a long time prior to this because I had some really bad experiences at a location in Chandler over a year ago. It seems as though they have changed the menu quite a bit. There are still some staple items that Applebee's has always had but definitely some added items as well. I would say that Applebee's is trying to do too much with this new menu. They have seafood, sandwiches, pasta, chicken, burgers and more it's too much. They should try to do two or three things really good instead of trying to do too many things mediocre. But alas it is a chain.\n\nI would visit this location again. It wasn't bad. I might just stick to beer and apps next time but we'll see..."

32032,4,"For those you love a beautiful crafted breakfast this was the place to go in Vegas. I'm so sad to see this place go. It was actually one of the highlights of my stay at the Vdara hotel in the new City Center off the strip. It was a wonderful experience. Unfortunately, I believe since it was so pushed away from the strip and other venues, this place unfairly suffered the lack of traffic other less par places got. I had the fluffy Blueberry-ricotta pancakes with orange blossom syrup."
13693,2,"Bellagio has such a big name to live up to, and on the surface it does. The decor seems nice enough, and the food selection wide and warm. \n\nBf and I went on Sat morning for champagne brunch. So we went off to get our food, and I had to wait in the omelet line forever, because I wanted egg-white, and the guy couldn't find it. When we came back to the table, bf's sunglasses were gone, and the waitress was telling us how she wasn't sure if we had left or not. Um, hello, we just sat down, why would we pay and then leave without eating? The sunglasses were never found again, and their general disorganized way of not being able to keep track of who's still eating and who's not really annoyed me. They should adopt a better system. I don't want to worry that someone's going to clean away our table just because we left to go get food.\n\nFood is good, otherwise. I loaded up on smoked salmon mostly. We now prefer the buffet at Mandalay Bay though. They're way more organized. And the have windows!"
36758,4,"YAY SUSHI! I've been to the location on Paradise a number of times, but I had yet to visit this one (even though it's closer to home.) I placed an order for pick-up, which was waiting on a nearby table when I arrived. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant looks exactly like the Paradise location, but about two or three times bigger. All of the food is excellent. I've brought people who have eaten sushi in Japan and people who have never tried sushi and so far, everyone has enjoyed the food at Kaizen. My BFF's fiance swore he hated sushi until he agreed to try a chicken teriyaki roll. Now he's hooked. That's what Kaizen does to people.\n\nAlthough there aren't a ton of vegetarian rolls, the few they have are excellent. They offer a vegetable tempura roll and a shiitake mushroom tempura roll that are just to die for. \n\nThe best part is definitely the dessert menu. They have green tea and red bean ice cream and FIVE types of mochi ice cream! \n\nOverall, great restaurant. I really like the variety on the menu, and the service is always good. Plus, it's open super late (like, 3 a.m.)"

34123,3,"There was nothing I didn't like about the experience. We started our meal off with the bruschetta which was topped with delicious marinated tomatoes. Then I had the citrus marinated beet salad with goat cheese. Divine! Best salad that I have ever had! My partner had the radish cucumber salad which he said was a little plain (thus only 4 stars). Now for the incredible entrees... I had eggplant Parmesan which was simply incredible, it was served with a pasta which was a perfect balance of rich, creamy, garlicky. Yummy! My partner had the rigatoncini with Piemontese meat sauce and he said it was delicious! And to top it off, our drinks were perfectly made each time.  We didn't order any speciality cocktails but stuck with out favorites; a greyhound and Jack and Coke.\n\nOf course, I must mention the service... I was satisfied. Food came out at a nice pace and everybody was friendly and polite.\n\nI highly recommend this place especially if you're staying anywhere near Crystals high end shopping mall."
17363,3,"MY FAVORITE Happy Hour (food) Menu!!  The calamari, the bbq chicken pizza, the sushi rolls, and the sliders are the best choices!  The Happy Hour prices are great too!  Sometimes it does get pretty noisy, but it's a fun place to go to watch a game and hang out with friends.  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the happy hour drink menu... Their cosmos make me sick, they're far too sweet, the wine doesn't ever seem like that good of a deal, nor do the saki bombs.  But the food is great!!!"

16110,2,"Sunflower is now Sprouts after being bought out. And I'm not so sure the changes Sprouts introduced are better. This location carries a limited line of Boar's Head Deli Meats and a few cheeses. The meat and seafood counter is also a bit on the smallish side as well but staffed by some friendly people. The bulk of their floor space seems to be taken up by fresh produce...and while prices are not exactly cheap, they are competitive with or cheaper than Whole Foods. \n\nSince Sprouts took over their supplement selection seems to have dropped in quality and selection. Case in point: Kava Kava. Where before I had 5 different choices in capsules alone, on my last visit I only found 2. And the brands they did carry were not ones I would buy. If you need basic supplements to start out this is a good location to explore. But if you've got experience with supplements you may find this selection to be a little on the pathetic side. \n\nAs much as I want to like this place, 3 Stars is the best I can give them."
2327,4,Great Service! Reliable and friendly. I just needed a new headlight installed and they were quick and accurate! The price is right ;) I will go back!
26596,4,First time eating at Wildflower. Went out to breakfast earlier this week with a friend. Great experience! Delicious meal! Got the lemon ricotta pancakes and 2 sunny side up eggs. Yummy! Love the berry topping. Cashier was super helpful in helping decide on that since I wanted everything on the menu :)
2701,1,"I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said \""uhh it's at the bar!\"" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only."
7717,3,Whoever the owner or guy is In charge there is the man. The first time I went i did the all you can eat sushi. Pretty good. The second time I went I did the BBQ. Short ribs and pork belly. Amazing. Third time. BBQ again. Short ribs. And the marinated pork. Next time maybe a couple sushi rolls and two orders of the short ribs.
3710,1,"So I was walking out of REI after picking up some last minute supplies for a backpacking trip, and was about to get in my car when I remembered I hadn't eaten all day.  So I popped in looking for some quick grub.  There were a couple of people ahead of me in line so I expected some sort of wait for my food, but it took over 10 minutes after ordering for my order to be ready.  This isn't a nice sit-down restaurant, but more of a \""fast food\"" type, order-at-the-counter joint.  For a bean burrito and a couple of cheese enchiladas it should not have taken that long.  And it was definitely not worth the $9.  The bean burrito was okay if that.  The beans had no flavor (compared to other Mexican food places of the same style.)  The red enchilada sauce had a good flavor and definitely tasted homemade, but the cheese enchiladas were enchiladas minus the cheese.  Seriously.  All I was given were corn tortillas rolled up with a completely hollow and filling-less center.  WTF.  Definitely won't eat here again."
43492,0,"On Wednesday, January 8th I was playing poker at the Wynn Poker Room and I got up to have dinner at the buffet (where I spent $344.17 for dinner) with some friends.

We went over to the cashier where I was to get my money back.  Christopher asked my to sign a receipt form, which I did, and then he said he would not give me my money back unless he could make and keep a copy of my driver's license.  With all of the identity theft going on I don't like having unnecessary copies of my driver's license floating around and I did not allow this.\n\nChristopher acknowledged that it was my money but said that they would not give me it back unless they photocopied my driver's license, which I would not allow him to do.  In my book, this is theft, plain and simple.  Interestingly, they then gave me my jacket back--making it difficult to argue that they had any doubt that they money and jacket belonged to me.  I pointed out that the same dealers were in the poker room and even several of the same players were still playing at the table--all of whom could identify me. They also have numerous cameras so they were literally a dozen ways they could have verified my identity, if needed, though Christopher never disputed that it was my money.  As of this writing they still will not give me back my money.\n\nIf you don't mind the poker room unnecessarily photocopying personal information or you don't mind having your money stolen, then by all means, go play at the Wynn Poker Room.  Otherwise consider other, better choices, like the Bellagio Poker Room."

48952,4,I had the lamb dumplings which were flavorful and I would highly recommend.  Very friendly service from the staff.  And I cherished the more traditional Chinese  seaweed served as the salad.  I'll be coming back just to find this salad.
44416,3,I've ate here three times already. The first two I got the lunch pulled pork sandwich with side. Tonight I got the 2-meat dinner which came with 2 sides and a corn muffin for $14.99. I got a size able amount of pulled pork which was moist and the barbecue sauce is great. I also got pork ribs which had a good dry rub on the outside.  The staff have been really nice each visit. Great food and customer service in my opinion.
45855,1,"Saturday Night review. JUST SO YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE IS NOT DAISY DUKES ANYMORE. IT'S AN ALL EBONY STRIP CLUB! Just in case anyone is wondering. Though we didn't necessarily mind, we were definitely surprised about it. This place is huge. It's got the stages, the scenery, the layout of an upscale nightclub/strip club. Probably the largest strip club in north carolina... 20 girls tops... WTF? Also, all the girls were covered the entire night. I understand we should work a little for some topless action but these girls made it obvious they weren't going to come to us for money. As the club owner said (he's a bald white/hispanic dude in his 40-50's) black girls are different on tipping and working for money. NO JOKE! Lap dances on the floor are $20 and so are the VIP private dances. So do yourself a favor and request the private dance instead. The girls aren't stuck up but it was just the fact that the club was D-E-A-D! After an hour of blowing money fast, the action stopped. We easily could have thrown another half of our wallets. We expected alot more. Another thing, shower stages all over the club... U-S-E-L-E-S-S! There is no VIP booths. Bottle service is $240 PER BOTTLE. 2 stars for wasted space and dumb ownership. Won't EVER EVER go there again."

I have tried many salons since I have been in vegas and this one is by far the best! My nails do not lift ! I can go almost three weeks without a fill, and the pedicures are wonderful! Besides the amazing job they do on my nails , there customer service is excellent ! They take care of there customers and they are extremely friendly and personable , hopefully this will be my nail salon for as long as I am here ."
38694,1,"friendly service, but very disorganized. Took them over an hour to serve us our dinner even though they weren't that business. I don't think they had any designated server to look after our table - so it all depended upon one very harried guy remembering to come by every half hour to check if were doing ok.\nChili Rellenos was subpar and the special that my wife had (mahi tacos) was over done.\nThe staff were really trying and seemed to care , but totally mis-managed and dis-organized or perhaps understaffed.\nThat was kinda disappointing since the food and service at the Los Dos in mesa used to be pretty good....."
44265,1,"I hate going to chain hair salons.  First of all, I don't have a \""fashionable\"" hair style.  I usually just shave my hair at home.  But sometimes I like to keep it a little longer.  When I do, I have it parted on the side and combed over.  I have hair that does not take to styling very well.  And I am losing it on top.  When I want a haircut (I've had 3 real haircuts in 9 years of living in Vegas) I want it cleaned up around the back and ears and trimmed on top leaving it just long enough to continue combing.  What I from Great Clips was quick service from a lady who made no small talk at all.  This does not necessarily bother me.  I am not one for small talk any how.  It just seemed very impersonal.  She cleaned up the back just frine from what I can tell.  She messed up around the ears.  The left side is trimmed higher than the right.  I feel off balance every time I look in the mirror.  The top was not trimmed much leaving that unsightly cowlick to deal with still even though I told her I wanted it gone.  She also asked me if I wanted to keep the side burns.  Considering I have a full face beard that is connected to my head by side burns it seemed like a stupid question.  Of course I would like to keep what ties it all together.  I would look pretty stupid otherwise.  This is exactly why I cut my own hair most times.  If I need a real haircut I think I will try to find an old fashioned neighborhood barber.  At least they may not butcher my hiar and charge me up the whazoo for it."
38584,4,"Tucked away in a more industrial part of the city, there lies a place where great drinks are made and the sound of the main ingredient in those drinks distills in the background. And it is here that you can get a pretty good cocktail for a damn good price as well. And! and! most liquors are available to sample (generously sample) before you choose.\n\nOf those offered, the whiskey is definitely top notch. There's very little hint of burn at the end. You could even swish it around and gargle with it. Yep, I said it. Now do it.\n\nThe rest aren't bad either. Especially the ouzo, which is normally the grossest liquor anyone ever invented, but not here.\n\nAlso, unlike some so-called \""distilleries,\"" they actually distill their own alcohol - quality alcohol."

Ok, I love my club host, who totally sets me up with getting into places, and he didn't disappoint here either... \n\nbut maybe it was the night I was there (fri) or the crowd or something, but it was just off.  Like not good off the hook, off.\n\nThe club wasn't nearly as busy as it usually is, there were tables empty, the bartenders were actually smiling and waiting to help serve you, rather than being 5 deep in customers, and there was no wait for the women's bathroom.  (that right there should tell you 'something is wrong')\n\ndrinks were good, i can't say I didn't have fun, but by 1am i was ready to go, and headed back to the strip to do some other clubs."

After his 10 minutes of flubbing and absolutely ignoring anything I asked him he finally rang it up. Grrrr I hate having to go back."
14880,2,"7/4/12\n\nI'd visited a few years ago, but it was too busy, and I didn't have time to wait 30 to 45 minutes to be seated, so I left.  I've had CK bookmarked to try since.  When I heard word that CK was offering a Fourth of July special (buy one entree, get the second for $4), I thought it was time to see what all the fuzz was about.\n\nTwo weeks beforehand, I made plans with a cousin to have lunch here on the 4th.  What a surprise to find out that CK was serving brunch, as well, and we breakfast lovers were thrilled to check out the breakfast items.  While our server went to check on a few ingredients for me, my cousin decided she'd try one of CK's more popular menu items, the Green chile burger, with poblano chile, cheddar, and chipotle aioli. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=MrEVQGZ6ZpX_8iuN0UWPxg#MrEVQGZ6ZpX_8iuN0UWPxg  As you may notice, the kitchen had forgotten to add the chipotle aioli, but this was quickly remedied when we asked for some.  (Service during lunch was very friendly and quick.)  I couldn't decide between the French omelet (which, funnily enough, my cousin and I initially mistook to be French toast and wanted to order this immediately) and the Lemon-ricotta hotcakes, but when I was told I could order one pancake for around $2, I chose the Classic French omelet, with sauteed spinach, gruyere, and herbs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=TVcjVg-hfSZCtnFq3FnaZA#TVcjVg-hfSZCtnFq3FnaZA and a hotcake.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=dtpAV4WfApPEZx_PvczrxA#dtpAV4WfApPEZx_PvczrxA  The omelet struck me as overcooked, and it was.  I asked my cousin to try it, and she too didn't like it, so I let our server know, and she quickly offered to take it away and replace it with something else.  I chose a plate of hotcakes, since we pretty much inhaled the first one!  I apologize for the lack of a photo...  My hunger got the best of me.  BTW, cousin loved her burger-- she finished all of the meat!  I never knew she could eat as much as me.  :)\n\nThe decor was beautiful-- lovely dark wooden tables and chairs, cozy booths lined with dark wooden beams, and heavy red fabric curtains, lightened with light-colored flowers, adorned the windows.  It felt classy bistro married country French and had a baby.  It worked for me.  \n\nA few days leading up to the Fourth, I thought a friend would enjoy trying out the dinner menu with me, so we agreed to meet there slightly before 6p.  It was very busy, much louder, and darker indoors that night.  The wait proved to be around 30 mins, or so, and we were given a buzzer as we elected to wait at the bar.  He ordered a cucumber-laced cocktail, while I asked for a blackberry-prickly pear concoction.  Both glasses were served to us without coasters or napkins, so our glasses left puddles on the table from which water would eventually end up dripping from our glasses to other points of the table, or, in my case, on me.  Even when we were finally seated at the table, our cocktail glasses remained un-coastered (is that even a word?), but now we had water glasses, too.  What a mess...\n\nBefore we were seated, I had to use the restroom, and I'd already noted earlier, as we walked towards the bar, that it's much harder to traverse the restaurant's space on my four-inch heels.  Not so much because of the heels, but because the textured floor was very slippery, and it wasn't even wet then.  On my return from the restroom, I had to pass the hallway between the kitchen and the bar, and I slipped on a water spill.  Thankfully, I was able to recover without having to hit the ground, but when I hailed a passing employee to alert her of the spill, how I almost had an accident, and that maybe she could see that it was taken care of, she just looked at the spill, then at me, and then proceeded to head to wherever she was going before I stopped her.  She didn't acknowledge that there was a problem, so I assumed she didn't care and wasn't going to do anything about it.  \n\nThe food was OK-- he wanted to try the salmon ($22), but was going to order the filet mignon ($37) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=W6wIGzyT32_AvSvqe7uuHA#W6wIGzyT32_AvSvqe7uuHA, and I secretly wanted to try the filet, so I ordered the fish, so that we could try both!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=oDlf6yqCLHn7uw3SuZfflg#oDlf6yqCLHn7uw3SuZfflg  The filet was TERRIFIC.  Perfectly cooked- he asked for pink throughout, but there were a few red spots.  Still tasted amazing.  The kitchen ran out of mixed veggies so friend ended up with bok choy, which he's never had before, but soon learned to like it.  The salmon would've been very good, if it didn't have a slight rancid-fish taste to it.  The lemon-white wine reduction helped.  Still, our plates were clean at the end of our meal.  (He was hungry.)\n\nThanks to CK for brunch and dinner.  In spite of a few mishaps, we all enjoyed the experiences."

I would give more stars but my experience with the timeshare people left a bad taste in my mouth."
35216,0,"I'm sorry but I have to retract my original review. My husband got food poisoning from their calamari. It was the only thing that we ordered that I didn't eat. I took a small bite but something in me told me I didn't like it. I have a good sense for food quality. \n\nMy husband agreed that it didn't taste like it was bad but the calamari was not hot enough and we think it wasn't stored at proper temperatures. I've been in the food business for years.\n\nAlthough most of my orginal review was accurate outside of the calamari, I can't get past the fact that my husband was sick for two days because of them. \n\nNEVER AGAIN.\n\nThere are toooooo many upscale restaurants in Vegas to waste time with places like this. They got lucky to land a small feature on the food network."

26708,1,"This is from a visit about a month ago.   I had a burger and a couple beers and my wife had a chicken flat-bread and a couple cocktails.  My fries were limp and overdone and the burger was lukewarm when served.  My wife's food quality OK.  The one thing that stood out was the lack of any urgency whatever to service.  I didn't time the wait staff or anything like that, but there were delays being seated, getting a menu, getting drink reorders, getting food orders from the kitchen, and finally, getting a check.  It was very obvious to me that the slot players and a couple \""regulars\"" got a ton of attention and prompt service from the staff---everyone else, not so much.  Docked Mr. John a star for crappy service.  Even though I live close, there are so many consistently better neighborhood joints and I won't choose to return."

3668,2,nice outdoor seating.  tasty sangria.  nice service although the bartender decided to have a discussion with someone when we were ready to settle up and move to a table.  Had the chicken alfredo.  Sauce was very nice but the chicken was so so.  The wife had spagetti and meatballs which was good too.  Worth the visit.  Your kids can play on the grass or playground while you wait for food etc.
11041,4,"hobby got the gyro bowl $7.87, I got the chicken Shawerma wrap with fries and a drink $8.25. Fries taste great, try the fries sauce. it's interesting. my chicken shawerma has some garlic sauce and tahini sauce.  it was the best compare to Filfila Mediterranean Cafe or  Kyklos Gyro.  Even it's not as big as the Kyklos Gyro, you can order the gyro bowl (either chicken or the beef lamb gyro), rice are delicious (maybe cook with gravy from the gyro). Honey cannot finish all the rice from his combo.  Definitely will come again."
23348,1,"Never have I been so disappointed in a place that I couldn't wait to check out.  This is one restaurant that I will never go back to.\n\nSarah G and I went there for a late lunch...we walked in and was told to sit anywhere we wanted to. I guess they just had a big party and there were many tables that were not cleaned up.  But I also noticed that the waiter was by himself, so I didn't make a deal about it. I also noticed that the decor was a little bit on the cheap side and definitely didn't have that \""wine\"" bar appeal.\n\nWe decided to order 2 appetizers and our entrees. (When we ordered our food, the waiter gave us a strange look, knowing that we were out of our minds for ordering so much food.  He could have warned us that my sandwich was going to be huge) For the appetizers we got calamari and spinach and artichoke dip.  Calamari was chewy and greasy, but the tomato basil sauce was actually very good.  Spinach dip was good, loved the cripsy bread.\n\nThen came our entrees.\n\nI won't go into Sarah G's food, but my chicken club sandwich was on the verge of horrible.  They had this chipolte sauce was way too sweet for this type of sandwich and even though I asked for no onion, I could still taste onion.  The sandwich was also a pool of grease. I could barely take 2 bites of it.  The funny thing was that the french fries were the only thing that wasn't greasy.\n\nThe waiter must have had an idea of our dissatisfaction because he never once asked us how our food was.  When we finally came by, we complained.  He took off our lunches from the bill.  By then, though, my stomach was reeling from all of that grease that i had just consumed.  \n\nNot happy at all."

When we were sat & I ordered Champagne they said \""There is no champagne.\"" This is after paying over $100 for 3 adults & 2 minors. The waiter said they were out...\"" no more\"". I Then asked the front entrance staff who said champagne ends at 4pm. The HUGE sign in the front of the Buffet ALSO said Mother's Day  Champagne Brunch...all day. I then asked yo speak to a manager. ..told him my issue..he walked up to the huge sign & said. ..\""Champagne ends at 4.\""  The sign is wrong. It ALWAYS ENDES AT 4\"". I then pointed out that it was a HOLIDAY/MOTHERS DAY & told him I had called ahead as well, and was told \""Mother's Day Champagne Brunch all day...he wanted to know THE NAME of who I talked to.

29902,1,"I don't understand the 4-stars folks.  Yes, the outside is pretty, yes, FLW did a great job on the design.  But you can come for lunch and see all that.  There's no reason to actually stay here.  The rooms are completely falling apart.  I had to move from my first one because the a/c sounded like a jack hammer AND the toilet didn't work.   The second one's carpet was soaking wet and the toilet worked...sometimes.  But after waiting an HOUR for the bellman to bring my key for the first move (when they originally said 10-15 minutes) I just sucked it up and stayed in the second broken room so I wouldn't be late for my meeting.\n\nSome of the food is pretty good and there are some creative options (the Ranch Stack at breakfast, the duck-fat poached fries at lunch).  But the service varied widely.  At Frank & Albert's, I had a bartender make me a to-go order who was so friendly and helpful.  The next day at brunch the waiter totally forgot about me and I couldn't get a refill and eventually had to ask someone else to bring me my check.  Plus, the room service took forever. \n\nI also had a few spa treatments.  The massage was so good that I sought out a comment card to let her manager know.  I believe her name was Katie.  The facial was very mediocre and only lasted 38 minutes  (rather than 50 as advertised).  I wouldn't say my skin was in great condition afterward.  And the facialist was also trying to sell me some cleansing brush and products.  Not my favorite relaxing experience.  \n\nOverall, 2 stars for being pretty, the good massage, and because customer service wasn't consistently terrible.

My first couple of bites, which were mostly of the melted cheese sprinkled on top, were good. The cheese itself was good, the entire dish was piping hot (which I love) so the cheese stayed all melty and delicious. Something about the mac and the cheese \""sauce\"" tasted way off. First, the sauce was sort of grainy tasting, like there was too much flour added and it was left to clump up. Not very creamy at all. \nI also noticed right away a distinct familiar taste that I couldn't quite identify....and then I got it...It tasted fishy!!! Almost exactly like clams. I don't know what the people before me ordered, so maybe it was from that?\n\nBut...ugh. Ick! That coupled with the fact that my bacon bits were barely crisp, I felt like I was definitely eating mac and cheese with clam mixed in lol. Turned me off completely."

They probably had 4-5 people on the line and they didn't communicate with each other- at all.  Every.  Complete and utter silence, which I thought was so strange.  They were not a-lovin-their job.  They were just robots going through the motion.   Maybe the kitchen is set up that way on purpose, but I have never seen a kitchen not communicate- at all.  I think it came across in the food too.  No love in the food.  I had a flatbread that was really, fell flat.  Nothing to it.  I did have a braised veal pasta dish that was good.  The service was okay.  I had a decent wine flight.  All in all, it was a strange experience that I didn't enjoy."
37739,1,"I ate at the bar area. The service was good. The staff was friendly. I even received the free mac and cheese app for checking in. Like most of the comments the burger are good but overpriced. I had the bacon burger and fries. Overall it was good but not worth $30. If I get hungry for a burger I would go to In and Out or Habit burger for a third of the price. Again, not a bad place and good service just overpriced."
19760,2,"What about writing a review about a gas station? Probably not the most useful review that I can do, but well, I went to this station on my last day of vacation, I guess that writing a review about it makes me feel kinda nostalgic!\n\nAnyway, this gas station is located less than one mile from the Airport, so I guess that prices are probably higher but it's nothing compared to what the rental car company would charge if the car is not returned with a full tank! So that was ok. Also the staff was friendly.\n\nOh, and after reading previous reviews I double checked my credit card statement to see if they overcharged me. They didn't. And then I remembered that I paid cash..."
8547,2,A solid place to get a freshly prepared burger. I like their onion rings also.
32773,0,"It's almost sad that I have to even give this place one star. If there was a half a star option, I'd be happier. So, I guess with my one star, I'll say the sweet tea was pretty good.\n\nThe rest was terrible.\n\nOur waitress, who resembled a brunette Lisa Kudrow, was a few chromosomes short of a normal functioning human being. As a server myself, I know that it's a stressful job. It doesn't take 20 minutes to bring drinks to 3 people when there is no wait and only 5 other people in the restaurant. She, not only charged us for our meal, but also for my roommates meal. A $30 meal turned into $70, and from that, a whole lot of problems.\n\nWhen we went back, the sign said they would open at 3. When we went back at 3, the sign said 4. When we returned again, pissed off, the sign said 5. Finally, around 6, they opened and I talked to some shady chick who was the front of house manager who said she couldn't do anything about the extra charges on my card, so then we waited for one of the owners. He then said he couldn't do anything (go figure) and said he'd do his best to take care of it. I finally got tired of waiting for days, and went through my credit card company. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best. Our roommate had the Mint Juliep, which was actually pretty good. Kudos to the bartender and only the bartender. I had the pulled pork, my roomie had the brisket, and my girlfriend had the catfish. We all concluded that the best thing on any of our plates was the fried okra. The brisket would've been better without the bbq sauce on it. And the catfish... Ugh. Greasy and fatty.\n\nIt takes a LOT for me to get upset enough to write a BAD review on anything because, on a whole, I'm pretty easily satisfied and tolerant. Let's be realistic, I'm a server at a restaurant that people either LOVE or HATE and has 3 stars on here! \n\nThis place is shady to say the least. Nobody has a clue what's going on. From what I see on craigslist, there is a lot of financial trouble with this place. Hopefully with all the money they seem to be pocketing from employees, they can hired some smart servers or just give up entirely."
6057,1,I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again.
15997,0,"Very disappointed in this restaurant for a few reasons. Though we were the only two people standing in front of them at 6pm on a Friday, the hostesses largely ignored us for two minutes gossiping quietly even after I said \""hello\"" and went ungreeted. That's fine, sometimes you get that when you hire teenagers - I get it. Our waitress was nowhere to be found for a good 10 minutes after we were seated and she was nice enough. Service was fine, not outstanding (after our drinks were empty for most of the meal) but no huge complaints - she was busy. I get that too. Unfortunately my boyfriend came down with food poisoning about seven hours after the meal and had to seek medical attention. The doctor confirmed it - all we had to do was say \""Famous Dave's.\"" We had to come back to the location afterward to pick up an item we had left and my boyfriend asked to speak with a manager to let him know he had gotten sick - the manager told him there was no way it was the food there and immediately gave him the brush off. Obviously the manager couldn't outright admit fault due to legal reasons, but that was the final straw for us. We won't be back."
34273,2,"It's a nice place to go to to watch any kind of sports or catch any kind of event on TV. It's just a really nice feel to it because of the environment at P.U.B. It's a really fun place(or I had a lot of fun) because I drank a lot when I came here. They have a beer challenge that you can do where if you finish a pint in 7 seconds, you get it for free which is limited to twice a day. A lot of fun things you can do here and it just puts you in a good mood with all the alcohol going on in the restaurant. \n\nThe food is a bit different though. The food is a bit average but all the food goes quite well with the alcohol(obviously). I would prob come back but I do wish the food tasted better or else it would have been an easy 4 stars. I would recommend people to drop by if you never tried it and do the challenge which I fail...(shh I already had quite a bit before the challenge)"
43013,4,"Went a while back for my birthday with four friends.... Great place for group because you can try more items.  So we tried virtually every app, the egg was the best and fries were okay when compared to the egg.  Elk ribs were outstanding and grits below I still dream about.  Wine was plentiful. Desserts were good but over shadowed by the rest of the meals highlights!"
11711,4,"this has got to be the best, most amazing little  coffee place i've ever experienced  besides cafe trieste in san francisco!! wish we had this in boston..."
9527,0,"oh my god, what a shitty piece of pizza. this is a tourist trap. shitty floppy bland pizza smothered in grease, charged me 50 cents to use my credit card? we only stumbled in here cause we were buzzed and uncle Joe's pizza was already closed down the street (we heard it was awesome). this place is cheap to say the least, and the pizza was extremely crummy, bleh!"
46418,1,Lucky Cup is typical Froyo place.   Bright and with 12 flavors and lots of the usual toppings.  They did have a few fresh fruit toppings.  The yogurt favors I sampled were a bit off and bitter.   The one worker on duty didn't seem to want to communicate with us or answer any questions.
27355,3,"I love Penhaligons products, it's always an experience popping in and even though this little shop is quite dinky, they still have a great range of products and the staff are really friendly too. I love the old school bottles and it almost makes you feel like you've transported back in time. My mum adores the Elisabethan Rose perfume but at \u00a370 I've only ever bought it for her once and had to half in with my brother. I do think the prices are a little excessive which is why I don't personally buy anything from Penhaligons and tend to go to L'Occitane or Crabtree and Evelyn instead as their products are significantly cheaper but they still stock gorgeous, traditional fragrances. It's also not really aimed at students like myself but I still like going in for a browse and I can always pick out in advance what I will hopefully be able to afford someday... hopefully not too far off.\n\nI noticed a stunning lacquered red box in a glass cabinet and it was displayed with three perfume bottles, a gorgeous old fashioned sterling silver brush and comb set and a little butterfly hair clasp on top. It looked gorgeous and I would love one of them on my dresser but it was \u00a3120... and that was just for the box.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, this is the only Penhaligons store in Scotland since the one in Glasgow shut down, there are a few other stockists but this is the only store exclusive to Penhaligon products. The whole store feels really traditional, the dark oak furniture is stunning, everything is really under stated, the packaging is amazing and the final purchase comes in a really pretty bag with tissue paper so perfect if you're looking for a gift."
28329,2,"If you don't have a car to leave the strip for Chinese food, then I guess this is the place to go to.  Located in Caesar's Palace, my wife and I checked out the menu and decided to give it a try.\n\nThe decor is great and modern.  But we waited awhile for the food we ordered.  We only ordered 2 dishes.  We ordered salt and pepper chicken and beef chow fun.  Both dishes were great.  \n\nThis place is expensive though.  And the service was just ok.  So if you have a lot of money to spare for food you can get for half the price off the strip, eat here."
36068,2,"Good food and prices, but nothing that surprises. I could not taste any wood in the barbecue. The ribs were fall off the bone, and the cole slaw is excellent. I thought the staff very pleasant. If you are in Anthem, this is a reasonable place for a decent, reliable lunch."
41094,2,"Great for a night out! We had an awesome time with the extensive beer and cocktails selection. Their happy hour prices are spectacular- a pitcher of beer ended up being just a dollar or two more than a glass. Our group of 12 or so had awesome service outside on the front patio. Everything we ordered food-wise was great too- artichoke dip, green chile dip, sandwiches, etc.\n\nMy only real quibble here is with the parking. One, the lot is tiny compared to the number of people the place can hold, and parking is very tight. Secondly, there is optional valet parking, which is apparently free but that fact isn't well marked anywhere that we saw. The stop and go of the valet parking tends to get in the way of the non-valet parking and overall it seems like there is no real benefit to having the valet."
1419,3,"This place was AWESOME!!!  My wife and I have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in, I had a yearning for Ramen.  It did not disappoint.  We got there just before happy hour, which is always a bonus, but would still go outside of happy hour.  The menu is quite extensive, the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well.  We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley, having been to many \""Japanese\"" restaurants.\n\nWe decided to try many different dishes, and were equally impressed with all.  I had the TanTan-Men, a spicy Ramen with pork, delicious.  We shared some tuna sashimi, which was fresh and tasty (looked like real pink, no added color).  We also shared the Seafood Delight roll, which has tuna, 'krab' and is topped with a scallop, fantastic.  The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs, this was my least favorite, but still good.  Of course the Kirin (on draft) was flowing as well as the house Saki.\n\nOverall the CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe impressed us to say the least.  We will be back to try more.  Thank you CherryBlossom, keep up the Great Work."
45697,1,"A bunch of us went for happy hour. Got a bbq burger, pizza, boneless wings, cheese sticks, long islands and margharitas. Drinks were poor at best, wings were ok, sticks were good, burger was ok but the onion rings on the burger were horrible. The service was fine. Not somewhere I would frequent."
21058,1,"Used to eat here often, especially since it has outdoor seating and is family friendly. The Fontina Burger and Tuna Burger were our favorites. We stopped going here after we saw that Joe's hosted a fundraiser for a local Tea Party candidate that featured none other than the Queen of Mean herself--Sarah Palin. So this may bolster Joe's reputation for those of you who love Right-Wing politics, but for us, it was a huge turn-off. We would rather spend our money on local businesses who put their funds into Progressive candidates or simply back into the community."
22180,4,"All you need is LOVE!\n\nI am a huge fan of cirque du soleil shows and I'm an even huger fan of the beatles. I've been dying to watch this show since forever. To put it into context, I have watched totem, zumanity, ka, and Zarkana and this show blows all of them out of the water!\n\nThis theater definitely has one of the nicest lobbies and I really recommend you take photos here before the show starts because it gets crazy packed. The theater itself is small and intimate, I highly recommend the areas that are right across from the screens because they really set the mood. Also, every chair has a built in speaker so the music you hear is crisp to perfection.\n\nI was moved by every single act. From the moment I heard the iconic string strum in A hard day's night, I was hooked! I have to admit, being a huge beatles fan really helps because you can immerse yourself in the lyrics and the recognize the time period undertones. The show is very deep compared to the other shows and it tackles racism, the berlin wall, heart breaks, and world war 2. It's not the most acrobatic or jaw dropping show rather it's the most immersive show. \n\nIn order to not reveal spoilers, some of my favorite acts were Lucy in the sky, black bird, Something and Hey Jude. This show is a visual and audio overload, so much going on the stage at a time! Basically, I was grinning ear to ear through out the whole show. I had a really hard time getting beatlemania out of my head. :).\n\nOverall, hands down the best Cirque Du Soleil show I've ever watched!"
32457,1,"Am I the only one seeing all the flies at the deli counter?!\nI really don't like this location. I always see flies, I can't get used to the layout, There's no Kids Korner, check out conveyor belts are usually dirty. \nThe location at 67th and Beardsley is awesome! Super clean, never saw a fly. Number system at the deli counter, Starbucks, and a  Kids Korner with stellar employees."
30575,0,"We stopped by on Easter Sunday after church, about 11:15am. They were not busy as I believe they must have just opened. We went through the drive thru & brought the food home... big mistake!  The ice cream was excellent as always BUT the 2 burger combos were horrible! The burgers looked & tasted like they were made the day before...they went to the dog. Even the buns were cracked & dried out!!! I now wish we had eaten inside so that we could have returned the food! After paying nearly $30.00 for this meal & the only edible thing is the icecream, I will take our business elsewhere! DQ is usually know for really delicious quality food but NOT at this location!!!  \nI gave 1  1 star for the employee who was really nice & upbeat!"
43384,4,"In Pittsburg for one day. We asked 3 different locals where to find some good clean organic food. All 3 times we got the same response...Marty's Market. The atmosphere is very wholefoodie but much more dine  in. The food was fantastic and the service was equally good.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in Pittsburg and wanting to eat some clean organic food I highly, highly recommend going to Marty's."
20138,4,Great place!! I love my nails and toes!! Will come back again!! Prices are reasonable and everyone is friendly and courteous!!
39261,3,"Yay! A friendly & clean new bar!\n\nI've been several times now, and have appreciated the diversity in both age and ethnicity of the clientele.\n\nFriendly bartenders serve reasonably priced drinks, and the lighting is bright enough to see your friends across the room. Big air-filters do their job, so even though many folks there were smoking, I did not reek when I got home that night.\n\nIts proximity to the college probably accounts for some of the younger crowd. Everyone seemed to be chatting and having a good time. \n\nDefinitely a good hang."
33399,3,"Wow, I was really surprised and impressed!  We noticed that the restaurant had changes hands, but had not thought to try it until we saw it on Yelp.  This is definitely not the usual generic, anglicized Mexican fare, but seems more like a family restaurant in Sonora.  The food was great and the portions were generous.  Our server was attentive and prompt, but to our surprise, we were the only patrons on a Sunday evening.  I agree with the other reviews about the decor... Kind of  campy with a fake jungle theme going, but it was fun and not over the top."
8399,1,"We came to look at 3 different vehicles.  One being a car my husband announced he would never drive, much less buy.  Okay then, expect a much larger car payment dude.  The second vehicle was out of stock.  So we looked at the third.\n\nSalesman was supposedly a retired Jersey cop...gruff I guess you could say.  Tried to tell me I wouldn't want the vehicle they didn't have...uh, look out front, I'm driving one.  Pulled all the usual stops like asking me what kind of payment I was looking for, etc.  I especially liked that he lit a cigarette in front of us outside.\n\nBut my favorite part, worthy of an extra star was this:\n\nHim:  \""So what else are you looking at?\""\nMe:  \""a Volkswagen\""\nHim:  \""Oh God (grabs his face in his hands), why the hell would you want that?  Those people can't even fight a war.\"""
4857,4,"I came here as a recommendation from a friend, because I was getting tired of the ridiculous prices the big companies like Firestone and Midas were trying to charge me for work done that usually required more work in the near future!\n\nThey have AMAZING service, it's owned by a Japanese couple, who are very friendly and accommodating. I've take my car here twice, the first was to take a look at the control arm bushings, ball barings, structs, and suspension. They told me all I need to do is replace the control arm bushings, which costed at a fraction of what Firestone quoted me!! \n\nSecond time, was a bit of an emergency, my window regulator snapped and the window dropped. This posed as a safety to my car so I brought it in the moment it happened, they took a look at it, told me what it was and gave me a quote. They told me they could do it that day and finish before the shop closed! Which was a saver because it was Friday and they close on the weekends!!\n\nThey also use genuine parts from whatever manufacture your car is from! Best thing to do is go in for an estimate and set up an appointment for later in the week if it's not urgent. \n\nThe gentlemen that works in the office along with the owner's wife was very helpful both times and remembered who I was, he also speaks multiple languages!"
14567,4,"Dinner buffet price is up to like $37/person now and wait on a Friday night at 5PM was non existent.  \n\nOur waitress was A-mazing!!!  My brother liked the tea so much that he asked what it was.  Not did she just tell him what it was but she went out of her way to find and write down the distributor name, website, and product flavor name (it was actually a papaya tea by China Mist).  She also noted that they were just testing out the tea and may or may not continue to serve it in the future but the response from customers has been highly positive.\n\nSome new favorite foods this time around to add to the must get list when you come to the Wynn Buffet:\n1) Chilean seabass (they didn't have this the first time I came here and I'm a big fish lover so you usually don't see this kind of fish served often)\n2) Spicy tuna hand rolls\n3) Some kind of buffalo salad\n4) Mushrooms (marinated in a delicious sauce)\n5) Key lime pie (I didn't like it before, now I do)"
20835,0,"Let me start off by saying I was so completely stoked at the great deal I got with this hotel.  I assumed it would be awesome based on how cool the casino looked. \n\nI have to say this was the absolute worst hotel experience.... EVER ( And no I am not be over dramatic). ok, fine, i will give it 1/16 of a star for the pricing, which should have been an indicator of what was to come. \n\nLets start off by saying there is absolutely no point to look on their website to judge what your room experience may be. That would be a complete waste of your time. The website does not resemble to room at all. First, the room is completely depressing, barely any lighting and really big, dark furniture. Don't expect to cover up with a cozy comforter, oh that's right, you just get a sheet to cover up with. So at night ( during the peak of summer) you can either sleep with your AC and freeze, or turn it low or off and toss and turn all night b/c your so freaking hot. \n\nLadies, don't plan on straightening your hair (which we all know if an absolute essential). That would just be too much to ask. Why you wonder. Well, the moment I plugged in my small straightener, the breaker went off and the bathroom went dark... TWICE and as a result my expensive beauty essential went dead. I made a claim with the hotel and after sending a security guard (WTF) to my room, I was told that the hotel was not at fault and I was just going to have to deal.\n\nThe nicest part of the room, I reckon, would be the bathroom... if you like to find a cockroach waiting for you in the morning as you walk into the shower...... seriously!\n\nI would have rather stayed at Hooters, at least I would have left smelling of chicken wings!!!!"
30756,0,I have used this laundromat for about 2 yrs now. The ladies whenever there is someone there are nice (if they're not on their cell phones talking away).... Then a couple of weeks ago I went in for the last time as I finally moved out of that area (Thank goodness)... Now I'm trying to call their customer service number and all you get is a damn answering machine saying they'll call back in 24 hrs. Well it's been about 5 days n still no call back. You're expected to pay $.50 for the card you get and of course if you have a balance on it good luck trying to get your money back. Also now there's bums and drunks laying asleep on the benches and no one seems to go anything about it. I'm so glad I don't have yo deal with this anymore!!!!

46938,4,"I've struggled to find decent Korean inLas Vegas, venturing to various restaurants across town. Either they lacked in how traditional try are, or they just execute poorly. Not only did I find a decent restaurant , I've had one of the most acutely spiced, fabulous bulgogi dish, and the best miso soup I've had in my life. If real Korean food is what you seek, Kitchen Gangnam is the place to be. Not to mention the atmosphere is absolutely beautiful unlike the ugly, dirty carpet restaurants of china town. Come here and I promise you won't be disappointed."
10133,4,I only had time for a beer and appetizer. Unfortunately for me i had tickets to criss angel(wish i had skipped the show and enjoyed a full dinner and a few more beers) i had a pint of aruba red and the buttermilk chicken sliders. Both went very well with eachother and look forward to having again some day. I really hope this chain makes its way over to the east coast.
7792,2,"Is the best bagel place I've been to? No. I came here for a \""to go\"" breakfast with my man. As we were waiting for our food, he whispered to me \""this place is filthy\"". The vent above the bagel rack was so dusty! The counters, floors and tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down either. We had already paid so we just decided to get our food and go. The guy who helped us was very sweet but incredibly slow. We spent almost 20 minutes waiting for 2 bagel sandwiches and a chocolate chip muffin. The bagel sandwiches tasted good (I tried a tomato basil bagel) and liked it. I also thought the variety in bagels was nice. The muffin wasn't my favorite but was edible. Prices were reasonable but nothing great. Just like my review says, A-OK."
47902,4,Darryl showed up right on time and made the repair in just a few minutes.  Cleaned up after himself and the price was very fair.  I will certainly use Darryl again and recommend him to others.
38941,2,"3.5 Stars..Got the all you can eat sushi, which was good and best of all desert is included. but the desert wasn't all that. Got gassed, sigh. The place was OK looking but heard the bathroom looks & smells good. But didn't personally go check it out. LoLz. The service was a bit slow.  There is a limit to 1 hour to all you can eat people.\nThis is an nice place to go eat baked & fried sushi rolls and a few other things. I rather go else where to eat all you can eat sushi tho. Not too into fried or baked sushi. Also my desert craze was not satisfied. =T\n\nNote: I ordered something twice and our waiter never bring it to me. sad face and I remind him 3x sigh. So at the end I just said for get about it."
14610,2,so they weren't serving king crab legs when we went...they had alaskan crab legs instead which weren't as big but delicious nonetheless...their prime rib is good but nothing to rave about tho that and the leg of lamb have their own carving stations...still nothing here really stood out...there's a huge variety of food and an abundance of desserts along with a great display of cakes....tho for the $$ i expected the food to be better...also there is an added gratuity for parties of 8 or more\n\nbottomless mimosa & champagne $10...servers were quick with refills and very friendly
33376,4,"We now have a favorite mechanic shop!  Had an oil pressure problem in our truck, took it to them and they even found the exhaust leak problem which we knew we had, but Midway Chevrolet and another mechanic said we didn't have!\n\nI love Jeff and the guys at Curt's.  They are an honest group and they have not made me feel as if they are out to nickel and dime us.  \n\nGreat place!"
18795,1,"Met a friend for dinner here the week of Christmas. It wasn't very busy at all so I guess everyone was out shopping. I ordered the three-cheese chicken penne with no tomatoes. The pasta wasn't very hot when it came out. There also wasn't a lot of chicken on it, which was fine with me, but others might find it to be skimpy. It tasted alright and I ended up eating it all... should have taken some for leftovers as the sauce is heavy. The garlic bread that came with it was not very good... it wasn't warm and tasted borderline stale. They really need to serve better garlic bread. We also got the chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert. It was pretty good. But overall, not my favorite meal."
38662,4,"I love BLD... LOVE it. I can't get enough of their breakfast foods - especially the Monte Cristo. Who wouldn't love yummy pieces of ham, slathered with raspberry preserved and sandwiched between two thick pieces of french toast. Yum! With potatoes on the side, too. Double yum. \n\nI've been several times, for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Breakfast is served until 2pm or so, but after 3pm (ish) the menu changes to dinner only (which is my only complaint... I wish I could have breakfast any time of the day). Their lunch sandwiches have all been delicious and their happy hour menu is pretty darn good too. \n\nThere is a full bar for all of your booze needs & a wonderfully comfortable outdoor patio. One big highlight for me is that BLD has a dog-friendly patio. I can bring my pooch with me after a trip to the dog park (Paseo Vista dog park isn't too far from BLD). They always offer me a water bowl when she's with me & even sometimes have massive dog bones. \n\nThe staff have all been fantastic - friendly and knowledgeable. I look forward to going back each time!"
15152,4,"We just had our wedding reception at le Cafe, and it was an EXCELLENT experience.  Sal Cavalcante was the manager on duty, and he made sure that our party was well taken care of.  The chef Adam, did an excellent job with the food, and Sal's team with the service..... Will definitely go back!"
31351,3,"WHEN I FIRST punched 'Hewat's Restaurant, Edinburgh' into Google my mouth watered at the number of rather appetising dishes the menu had to offer.  I thought to myself... 'This looks like my sort of food'.\n\nThe restaurant opened in Edinburgh in 2004 and is run by husband and wife team Richard and Margaret Hewat.  Chef Richard boasts a formidable CV indeed; positions as head chef at RBS world headquarters and Fisher's in Leith giving him notable pedigree. With Margaret's wealth of front of house experience, the couple work closely to maintain the reputation of this well-established business.\n\nThe warm, rich dining room had a lovely atmosphere to it indeed.  Each table immaculately laid and complemented by the glow from the tasteful chandeliers and contemporary art work which adorned the spotlessly clean dining room.\n\nFor starter I opted for Cullen skink with mussels (\u00a36).  I do enjoy sampling the different variations of this classic dish from chefs around the land I must say. The mussels were plump and perfectly cooked, as I'd expect from a chef who once headed a team (at Fisher's) that won the coveted Egon Ronay award for Seafood Restaurant of The Year.\n\nIt did take me a few mouthfuls to get into the dish as I felt it lacked a good whack of seasoning, but it did grow on me as the flavours from the smoked fish met with the creaminess of the soup to start the meal off on the right foot.  It was also great to see a restaurant make its own bread; something I feel sadly lacks in eateries these days.  \n\nSarah had warm duck and shallot tarte tatin with plum, port and balsamic dressing (\u00a36.50).  This was a great idea for a dish but although the duck was tender and pink, the pastry was a little under done and the shallots needed a bit more caramelisation.  The sauce was very pleasant and harmonised the dish.\n\nThe dining room started to fill up as we came to the main event but that, to the staff's credit, did not alter the quality of the service as my roast tenderloin of wild boar, braised pork belly, apple compote, crackling and pulled pork and black pudding mash with savoy cabbage and chorizo (\u00a316) was served up.\n\nAt first glance, I thought there were a lot of elements to this dish, all of which I like, but wasn't sure if it perhaps had too much going on.  I dived into the boar first, which was well executed and seasoned and complemented by the rich gravy.  \n\nPork belly is one of my favourite cuts of meat and I like to see it done justice. The actual meat itself dissolved on my tongue but I would have like to have seen the skin crisped up rather than left flabby. \n\nI didn't feel the stick of crackling that was offered really gave anything to the dish bar an aesthetic aspect and it wasn't particularly great crackling, as some parts were just too hard to bite through.\n\nThat in mind, I must give a special mention to the pulled pork and black pudding mash with the savoy cabbage as they were just a total triumph and worked in perfect harmony with the apple.  The chorizo just added that little hint of spice that lifted the dish up a notch. If only the skin on the belly had been seared for a minute or two, this would have been a knockout plate of food.\n\nFor main, Sarah had roast rump of new season lamb with redcurrant and rosemary jus, champ potatoes, red cabbage and ratatouille (\u00a317).  \n\nThe lamb came presented in a rustic-style and was perfectly cooked; pink and tender while the red cabbage offered a great flavour and maintained a slight bite.  Every vegetable component of the ratatouille was perfectly cooked and identifiable through a rich tomato sauce with the seasoning bang on the money. \n\nA minor criticism would be the sprinkling of spices that seemed to come on every plate; it's just a tad outdated.\n\nWe admired the wine Margaret had recommended as we pondered our dessert course. \n\nWild strawberry cr\u00e8me brulee with shortbread (\u00a35.95) caught my eye while Sarah went for the classic sticky toffee pudding (also \u00a35.95). \n\nThe brulee passed the acid test when I cracked the crisp top with my spoon to reveal a subtle and rather pleasant flavour of sesaonal strawberry.  The shortbread was buttery and with suitable snap, while the berry compote cut through the creaminess without being too sharp.\n\nSarah's sticky toffee pudding was light with a silky, smooth butterscotch sauce as you'd expect.  The vanilla ice cream was lovely and added a cold contrast to the pudding.  Both were a great way to end the meal.  \n\nI suppose at the end of any meal you ask yourself 'would I go back?' and I certainly will be back.  The level of cooking demonstrated by Richard and the quality of service leave me looking forward to discovering more of delights that got me so excited when I first laid eyes upon the menu at Hewat's."
28609,0,"I was so amped up for this event and when I arrived, I was immediately unplugged. This was my first encounter with Glendale's Chocolate Affair and my expectations were set WAAAAY too high.  Where are the elaborate chocolate displays and demonstrations? Where are the artisians? The enthusiasts? The chocoholics?  All I saw were ridiculous lines of people waiting to pay too much for your basic fair food in which some of it was dipped in chocolate. BFD.  Maybe it was the best chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick ever, but I will never know because I'm not waiting any longer than 15 minutes to find out. \n\nNext time, I'm just going to head down the Central Phoenix Farmer's Market where I can give my money to local folks who are passionate about their craft and are fantastic at what they do. (Bite Me Brownies, \nWei of Chocolate, etc.) I won't have to wait in line longer than It's a Small World at Disney for some crappy apple dipped in chocolate. \n\nThankfully, we didn't bring the dogs as they would've been trampled and I feel sorry for the people who had their little ones in strollers because they were like salmons swimming upstream.  I overheard one dad say that he had had enough.  He was taking the stroller back to the car and just carry the baby. \n\nOn a positive note, the entertainers were good for the time I was there and I found the little area shops charming."
17525,0,"No thank you. I don't like sounding like a snob or suggest that it is not possible to run a successful Japanese restaurant if you are not Japanese, but this place is horrible.  These folks aren't Japanese and their inexperience with the food shows.  The sushi rolls are very sloppy and loosely rolled, the crab is not crab, but Krab... Fake for sure.   The worst was the yakitori. Don't bother, because it is really a teriyaki shishkabob with broccoli and squash. The meat was over marinated and under cooked.   Run away and don't look back, there are plenty of authentic places around that don't cost any more than this place and will give you real Japanese food. The only thing Japanese about the place is the beer.  Very disappointed and won't bother a second time."
46108,3,"Stayed here for the first time.. Fabulous!  Great atmosphere... Friendly staff, clean hotel & rooms!  Only down side is there are no shower curtains in the showers... It's cold out there!  They said the architect they had said its the new style!  Oh well. Everything else was great!!"
29096,2,"This was our first time going to Tandoori Times.  The atmosphere was pleasant and I thought it would be more crowded than it was.  \nThe good: the food. Food was great. I had the goat curry which was their Friday special, and it was wonderful.  My husband who doesn't like most curry dishes stuck with the tandoori chicken which was wonderful as well. A side of pesto naan rounded the meal out.  No complaints about the food at all.\n\nThe bad: the service.  Our waiter was very polite and friendly the few times we saw him.  He brought us menus and then left us waiting for 15 minutes before coming back to take our order.  He then disappeared for most our meal. We had to ask another server to track him down to get our bill.  Needless to say our drinks were not refilled.  We also waited a very long time for our food.\n\nThe ugly: the belly dancing.  Actually it wasn't the bellydancing. More specifically the dramatic rise in music and the incessant finger chimes of the dancer grew to be irritating.  The dancing was fun to watch in the beginning but became tiresome after first few minutes.  It was impossible to chat without shouting at my husband.\n\nGood place. Prices were reasonable and the food was good. But the service needs some work."
41691,0,"I have to agree with the other reviewers in that this was pretty horrible. There was a price for parking ($5) and a price for entrance($10), which essential got you.. nothing. Once inside you still had to pay for any of the food you ordered. For $15 i could have gone to an actual restaurant. \n\nI was picturing something like a whole bunch of food trucks with ready samples that were either free or for a nominal fee. At first we thought the tickets that they were selling were for the food. \n\nWhat it actually was was a bunch of food trucks selling their regular products. While the food was small, and some of it tasty, the prices were not good in the least. With how much money it cost, i wasn't interested in going to multiple food trucks, which i thought was the point of the event. \n\nIf that weren't enough, the lines were absolutely horrible everywhere. A huge line to get into the parking lot, a line to get into the field, a line (many over an hour long) for each individual truck, and a line for overpriced drinks. And it wasn't as if you got to the front of the food truck and got your food. Several of them, you placed your order, then waited again for them to prepare it. With how many people there were and how limited the menus were, i can't imagine that they wouldn't prepare a bunch at once and have them ready. \n\nWe gave up and left around noon to go to mcdonalds. At that point we overheard that several trucks had run out of food. And the event was supposed to last through dinner. \n\nEverything about it was just horrible."
26191,0,"Have you ever gone to a restaurant and the food was good, but the service and customer service was so bad that you can't ever walk through the doors again? For me that is my experience at Rosati's tonight. I placed a phone order after looking at their menu that was posted on their website. I had the order amount in my head based on the prices on the website menu. When I questioned the total to the cashier, she printed out the prices. I asked her if she knew that the prices on my bill were different than those on the website menu. She told me something that really didn't make sense. I replied that I thought they should charge me the prices from the website menu. She just gave me my change and didn't even say thank you (I guess the attitude started). I asked to speak with the manager, but she said he wasn't there. If it were my restaurant, I would have gladly matched the prices that were on the website menu, no questions asked or attitude given. Another sorry example of good food that is outweighed by bad and/or rude customer service."
1566,1,"Fish was good, atmosphere stunk, service was incredibly slow, and it seemed like a cross between red lobster and chilis.\n\nAlthough my food was good it took about 15 minutes to order my appetizers while eating at the bar which was almost empty.  Then he completely forgot to let me order an entree.  Meanwhile it took 45 minutes to get my appetizer.  The entree came pretty promptly thereafter though.  \n\nOverall it is good fish and it is very cheap but not sure it is worth it."

18849,4,"Aerogelic Ballooning has always been one of my favorite ballooning companies in the Phoenix area.  I've previously worked for 2 separate broker companies partnering with Aerogelic Ballooning and our customers consistently gave great reviews and never a complaint for this hot air balloon company.  \n\nI would highly recommend Aerogelic Ballooning to my friends, family, and even my current boss who lives in Glibert.  He may actually be getting an Aerogelic Ballooning Gift Certificate from me this year for Christmas!  \n\nCompared to other hot air balloon companies that operate in the Phoenix area, Aerogelic offers a very personable experience.  With smaller baskets than some of their competition, Aerogelic's balloon rides provide great visibility and tons of fun.  \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting up with Aerogelic's owner in Albuquerque where he invited me to dine with his family and crew over breakfast after a morning flight.  The crew is loyal knowledgeable, and always strive for the best customer experience that can be provided."
41064,0,Pizza was delivered in a timely fashion but it was burned and almost inedible. The cheese bread was even just average. I will not be ordering here again.
6018,0,This place had the nerve to email me through yelp requesting to see if the issue can be resolved  and then. .  NO ONE followed up  to reach out to me after I left a message for the requesting  party.  BUT I expect nothing more.  POOR CUSTOMER  SERVICE
12064,3,"We're all adults, let's be honest here- this is not where one goes when sober. But at the end of a long night out with friends, this hits the spot! \n\nTip #1: Don't use the bathroom, seriously, it will scar you for life. Worst. Bathroom. Ever. I have used it twice in life, once at age 12 then again at age 27. Both times I could have used therapy afterward. \n\nTip #2: Order a small fry if you're by yourself or with 1 other person- there will be much more than you expect, it's like a large McD fry x 6. Get cheese! The cheese is glorious while hot, but doesn't reheat well and gets minus one star because it used to be better 5 years ago.\n\nTip #3: Go tipsy! Otherwise you might look at the hygienic issues surrounding you and get turned off. But for all of its skankiness, I've NEVER known anyone to get sick here. In fact, it's saved me some nights from waking up hung over.\n\nTip #4: Enjoy!!!"
49408,1,Food is decent. Might be back because I saw a few more vegan options on the menu. The staff is horrible. Terrible customer service. My food was ready but the front girls didn't notice because they were too busy eating cake and gossiping. Had to wait an extra 5-10 minutes because of them and all I ordered was hummus and pita.
42134,4,Love it! Great burgers and amazing service at prices about the same than a non-organic chain. It's a great concept

41582,0,"My wife and I had the exact experiences as everyone else and we are kicking ourselves for not reading these reviews before we adopted!\n\nLike everyone else when we first applied to adopt, Moondoggies could not be quicker in responding to us and setting up a meeting. We came all the way up from San Diego because we had been searching for a Great Dane puppy to adopt. The lady we met was very nice and seemed totally legit. She said we looked like good people and if we wanted we could adopt the dog on the spot. She also said that the adoption included having the dog spayed and chipped. She even offered us a great deal on getting the dog stomach stapled.\n\nHow could we say no?\n\nWe signed the contract and the check and we were told that they would be calling us to make sure we got the vaccinations done and to schedule an appointment for the spay and chipping.\n\nAnd like everyone else here... We never heard from them again. We have called the lady we talked to, we called the number on the sight, we wrote emails, and even tried to reach them on Facebook. For awhile I really thought that they were just busy and felt bad for them because they are run by volunteers.\n\nBut what made me realize that they were a scam was when I posed as a person who was interested in adoption and was put right through to someone. Her tone immediately changed when I told them that we were looking to get our dog spayed and chipped. She was very short with me and said that she was away from the office and would have to look at our file. Then she would call us back. She didn't.\n\nUpdate Feb 16---\nMoondoggies contacted us after I posted this review and finally offered to have our dog spayed and chipped. However after not hearing for them for months we have already had our dog spayed and chipped. I was glad to finally hear from them but it was sad that I had to right a bad review in order to for them to finally contact me. I truly hope that they are a real rescue place and not a puppy mill or a scam. I hope that they make some serious changes in the way they do business!"

38742,1,"If not for the delicious turkey crepe and cookies I would have given this one star. The service was horrible, the decor obnoxious and the cupcake desserts were, I kid you not,  4/5th icing (seriously gross).  Our waitress was no newbie, but maybe she had too many tables, maybe she wasn't too bright or maybe she was just so slow that she couldn't recall the order by the time she got to the computer. She totally forgot our appetizer and I appreciate the fact that she owned up to it twenty minutes later.  By the time our food finally arrived, the pasta was cold, but we were so hungry we didn't send it back.  Stick to the carry out desserts."
8732,2,"A solid three stars. I was hoping for an american clone of my favorite chicken place in Rocky Point and sadly, this didn't compare. Not even close. However, that Rocky Point chicken is the greatest thing to ever touch my tastebuds and thus leaves very big shoes to fill. The chicken at El Pollo Supremo was a little dry and I really wish there was an option to just get chicken breast instead of the 1/4 chicken that I ordered that was all dark meat. The tortillas served on the side were nice and fresh and I loved the pickled onions. For the price I'm not sure you can find a better lunch. Oh, and David Spade was at the table next to me so I guess what's good enough for celebrities is good enough for me ;)"
5013,3,Very good food but not a place to go if you are in a hurry. Habib is a very gracious host and explains the entire menu to you if you are a first timer.  It is a very nice restaurant with classy decor. Definately a good place for a fancier dinner date or somewhere to go if you plan on having a conversation with your dinner companions. All of the reccomendations by Habib were wonderful dishes.  I had the lamb and it was so moist and tender and the rice was a fantastic combination of spices and herbs like I've never had before.  The hummus was ok and the pita bread warm and fresh. If I'm in Vegas again I would definately go back.
29632,1,"When I first saw their hours of operation I thought it was a mistake and they meant to write p.m., instead of a.m., but now that I have eaten there twice it makes more sense. When nothing else is open, and you're wasted, I'm sure this place ROCKS!"
42428,0,"The food is good but the service isn't worth it. I would say unless you're spanish speaking... this place isn't where you want to go; ESPECIALLY when you're hungry and or diabetic and it's been hours since you last ate/drank. \n\nthe girl who took our order didn't speak any english, i mean NONE. i understand its an el salvadorian place and I'm perfectly accepting of the fact that english may be a 2nd language but to speak zero english is rough for the customer. \n\nshe stood at our table and didn't say anything, she just stared at us. then she asked me if i spoke spanish, which i don't cause i'm Filipino not Latin, I told her no, then gave her my order.  \n\nI wanted 2 papusas and a coke, i said it slow (without being rude) and i even pointed at the picture; again she asked me if i spoke spanish, still no. Then my boyfriend said his order: carnitas burrito... she looked at me and said \""que\"" - so i repeated it exactly a little bit slower this time \""carrrrr-niitas burrito\""\n\nwe got our order: my bf got his burrito, i got 1 papusa. nothing to drink. as which point i repeated, i wanted 1 coke and 1 more papusa. she smiled and nodded. still, I got nothing. she stared at me from across the room and every time i looked up to see if she was going to bring me a coke, she looked down at the floor. no coke ever came and that 2nd papusa -- forget about it. \n\nwe were one of 3 tables occupied... so it wasn't busy. it wasn't loud, it wasn't anything... there was no excuse for the horrible service. 'Coke' as a brand is thee most popular product in the galaxy...  there should have been no reason why she shouldn't understand that when i said coke, it meant, please bring me one, not, i just like to say the word. To top it off, I'm diabetic so by this point it had been 8 hours since the last time i had anything to drink or eat so al i really needed the sugar, i was starting to shake and feel faint. \n\ni understand that not everyone speaks english but if you're going to hire people to take orders for your restaurant, that person should really have a basic understanding of the language or at least some sense to put two and two together."
49364,2,Came here on a Saturday because Showtek was going to dj. We bought our tickets presale so we didn't really have to wait in line. The place is a little small and cabanas and bungalows are upstairs with a few by the pool. The do have tables towards the back. The crowd was ok. There was a few people dancing and the pool was all full. I didn't even bother trying to go in. There is one set of restrooms and you can't take your drink in there. The place over all is really nice mainly because it's new. It's nothing compared to encore or wet republic. But it was nice and I had an ok time. Towards the end we got invited to a table and from there you can see the whole strip. Totally an amazing view.
12592,3,"This is definitely a 4-4.5 star hotel that is on the grand scale.  The outside of this hotel brings back memories of Venice, Italy albeit all condensed together in the \""front yard.\""  The decor is stunning if not over the top throughout this hotel with a lot of \""wow factor.\""\n\nThere are gondolas that travel through the shops area with singing gondoliers and beautiful \""walk-over bridges.\"".  One thing about this hotel is it is always packed full of people.  The Phantom of the Opera show was very nice and again draws a lot of people.  The shops are upscale but not the top designers.  The restaurants are average to fine dinning with a food court in the casino.\n\nThe rooms set a standard in Vegas.  They are large all suite rooms featuring a sitting area with a sofa that converts to a bed.  Again, over the top Italian decor but luxurious non-the-less.  I believe the smallest rooms are 800-900 sqft and the upper floors hold rooms that can be jaw dropping.\n\nWith all of the decor and the phenomenal club TAO it still is only a 4-4.5 star hotel next to the Wynn/Encore, Bellagio, or Caesars."
38955,3,"Long wait, Good food, Service was ok over all experience was good. I've been there many times (from day one) Tony is an amazing Sushi Chef that we have followed around. Only draw back of the place is occupancy. Way to popular for such a small establishment. Price is fair for AYCE and portions are proper. I'm not a big fan of rolls but might mix it up once in a while and have one or two. I prefer sticking to the basics. Will be back to review again, next time I hope to give them that extra star!"
6460,2,"I can only base my review on the drop-off donation ease only, as I have not actually been into the store.\n\nI am in agreement with Jeff S.'s review in that it is difficult to get in and out of.  South Blvd is a nightmare on a good day and I am usually dropping items off on my way out of work in the evening, so it's a little worse.\n\nThe drive-thru drop-off spot is convenient once you are able to turn into the lot.  I have found the staff to be very friendly, they always come out and assist with whatever I am leaving, be it bags of items or furniture.  The have consistently asked if I would like a receipt as well."
7918,4,"I love staying here.  First off, I agree with one of the other reviewers, request a poolside room and you can sit outside looking at the palms and the pool on an adirondack chair.\n\nThe staff is really friendly, and seem to really enjoy their jobs.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfy.  The free wi-fi is pretty fast and I've gotten a strong connection every time.\n\nThings that I love about this Holiday:\n\n-Shuttle to and from the airport, and anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the hotel\n-HAPPY HOUR!  2 types of beer and 2 types of wine, all free, for 2 hours, plus snacks.  In the summer they ramp up the snack selection and have taquitos and other more substantial food.\n-Continential breakfast: it is good, plenty of selection, they let you take as much food as you want back to your room.\n-If you forgot a toiletry, they give you one for free\n-A couple of PCs in the lobby in case you need to get online and don't have your own\n-A cute little book exchange.  They have a shelf full of used books, the kind you read on a plane like murder mysteries, with a \""take one leave one\"" sign.  I love the little touches.\n-Free paper every day\n\nI just feel welcomed every time I come here, and will never stay anywhere else when I am in Scottsdale."
8747,1,"It's overpriced pizza, for anything with more then 1 topping your looking at over $3 a slice. 2 slices and tap water for $7 w tax. Don't get me wrong its not the taste that bugs me its the price. Its good pizza, lots of flavor and they have different slices to pick from, potato, bbq chicken, pepperoni, sausage, cheese even. The best deal is if you can get everyone to agree on a whole pizza pie.The staff is less then friendly, they just ring you up take your cash or card and off you go...heck i didn't even get the total or a receipt for that matter. Had to look at my credit card online to see how much it really was... but for some reason its packed every time so that tells you right there the pizza is good i guess. The inside is a little small and crowded and not good for group lunches."

28417,4,The staff here are friendly and go out of their way to assist their customers.  I had an awesome experience with a female security officer when I was there gambling she assisted my disabled friend and I up to our room and was extremely courteous.
35831,4,I'm surprised by the negative reviews because I loved the customer service. I came in with a friend and we both had a groupon and no appointment and they were very busy. They could only take one of us and the other had to wait an hour. The owner ended up doing my mani pedi instead of taking her lunch break so I didn't have to wait....very cool since I already agreed to the wait. I upgraded to a french tip and this was the best mani pedi I've ever got. I got so many random compliments on my nails which is pretty rare since I have relatively short nails so they don't usually stand out. I wanted to pay the extra $5 for the callous scrub but the owner said that it would be a waste of money since my feet only really needed the regular scrub. I felt she was sincere and didn't try to up-sell me. The regular price for a spa mani pedi is $50 but they also carry package deals. I will never get a mani pedi at the hotels cause a pedi alone can be $85...damn! I don't have sewer feet so not sure why anyone would pay that lol. This is my go to place in vegas for mani pedi from now on. Take a short drive off the strip and be smart with your money.
27893,1,"OK, I've been here six times now and it's become one of my favorite restaurants.  Yesterday, Father's Day, my daughter and family took me there for supper and this time my experience was not so good.  We were seated right away by a friendly person, but then we were forgotten.  After 15 minutes a waiter finally came by to help us.  While we were waiting I counted the number of tables that were occupied including ours, the number was 5.  I also counted the number of workers that were talking and  hanging around what I assume is a computer station, that number was 9.  Something is wrong here.  The management needs to kick some ass to get the workers on the ball.  As usual there is no complaint about the food, I think the quality and the prices are perfect.  I will be back but I hope the service improves."
7549,3,"I've been coming here for years. I like to stop by when I have to make a Fry's Electronics run. My favorite, beside a slice and salad, is their eggplant parm sandwich. I think they are one of the best in the in the Valley. (See my photo) I order the eggplant sandwich with a side of pepperchinies. Highly recommended. \n\nStaff is always friendly. A real family operated business, and always\nfriendly."
24937,1,"Each time i write a review for the hospital i feel as if things get better only to get worse. In my previous review i wrote one thing that i didn't think i would get to touch base on again, but guess what coincidences happened and it just so happened to be a coincidence that i was in the same room that we gave birth to our first child in. I thought it was a good thing at first to be able to make memories in the same room with our new child until i remembered what i had written after being in the room for roughly 20 minutes and i quote\""engineering to come to the room to check the hot water and a leak in the shower head well i think I'm going to check out and i don't think these issues will get addressed.\"" Well the hot water issue in room 270 in labor in delivery has not gotten addressed and its been over a year it has been such a common thing that when i brought it to our new nurses attention Laurel she simply stated that they were aware that the hot water didn't get hot in that room fast enough and that there work around was to use the hot water in the sink in the room itself and not the sink in the bathroom perhaps these nurses have forgotten what it was like to be giving birth but being embarrassed by having to have a door open while your husband tries to get you a hot washcloth for you to wash off is not the ideal solution and the fact that it has not been addressed in over a year is just baffling and not only does the hot water take a long time the water also backs up when you're trying to take a shower. SO PRAY THAT YOU DON'T GET ROOM 270 \n\nMy encounter with the nurses this time was a bit more pleasant although we did have moments of mis-communication the main nurse that we dealt with tried to make things right as much as possible but sometimes she did fail. Laurel was the name of our main nurse and overall she was ok except for the fact that I felt like she lacked a bit of empathy. Allow me to elaborate my wife and I arrived to the hospital around 8:00 am it was a Saturday and the hospital seemed a bit empty there was boxes that were littering the main entrance and they had not been covered by anything later in the day they were covered with sheets although they were a real big eye sore. When we arrived Laurel greeted us and took us to our room which seemed very familiar to me we had some small talk and she checked my wife she put in some bill to soften up the walls they said and then we waited my wife started having really bad contractions and so the nurse was called my wife was on the edge about getting or wanting an epidural she wanted to try natural birth so the nurse gave my wife some medication that ended up knocking her out and when she came to she was in extreme pain the anesthesiologist was called to do the epidural my wife was screaming from so much pain and Laurel came in said the anesthesiologist is here so we need you to sit up she did so but all of a sudden here screams became louder and seemed more painful it was to the point where we didn't know what or who was hurting her the anesthesiologist asked if it was him all of a sudden between the screams my wife blurred out i can feel his head i think I'm having the baby the anesthesiologist had not put the epidural in yet and he himself stopped and said I have not done anything if you would like we can check her well laurel being the helpful nurse she is decides that no its more important for him to get the epidural in, instead if asking my wife she just tells the anesthesiologist to proceed he continues and my wife continues to scream  the anesthesiologist finally gets the needle in and my wife sits back well guess what the child is crowning and he was coming out just like my wife had said If laurel would have taken the time to let my wife make the decision instead of her then my wife would've never had to get the epidural since the baby was already crowning at this point the anesthesiologist is nervous and starts to hit my wife with what i though was called boost but i believe i was later corrected to it being called a bolus dose this in turn made it hard for my wife to push because she all of a sudden became numb from the waist down and then it started to work its way up to her shoulders but the time the baby was out my wife was fully drugged up and could barely hold our baby I feel like these drugs where administered incorrectly because instead of it helping the the birth she literally just sat up barely holding onto consciousness."
40739,4,"Love this place. Have been coming here regularly for the last few months. Even though I am not a vegan/vegetarian anymore, I still love the food.

Seriously... it's the kind of thing you have sexy food dreams about.\n\nThe staff are always pleasant and helpful, and the space is always clean and welcoming. I will continue to come back here for sure."
37291,3,"First Impressions for me were: I'm here for an early middle of the week lunch and they have people in both rooms, it is not crowded at 11:30am yet there are several people already here.  They let me sit where ever I want instead of just taking me to a table, nice though it does not effect my rating.  \n\nI'm seated and I notice the \""Garage Doors\"" Urban Architecture and simple Decor so I like this!  It's got Potential!  Plenty of Outdoor seating too, Great designs, this place is cool!\n\nChips and Salsa:  I LOVE great Salsa!  This one is better than A-OK and I guess I can say I'm a fan, though barely! Even so, this Salsa is better than many I have tasted in the Charlotte area.  Hot Chips (no not the strippers, I mean dancers and not the Potato Chips) these are Excellent Corn Flour (I guess) Tortilla Chips 5 yelp stars.\n\nThe REAL Food.  I'm telling my waitress what I'm thinking and she makes suggestions:  I could get Two Tacos instead of three (on the menu they are listed as three) I could get one of each instead of choosing just one flavor and I could get a different wrapper instead of Corn Flour!  So I'm IMPRESSED!  I order two of one and one of the other!  I'm glad I ordered two of the Steak with White Onions it was very good!  I want to forget the other one!  If I had only ordered it I would probably not be writing this review.  So the Steak with White Onions (see my photo I don't know what it is called) was very good 4.10 yelp stars.  The different Salsa or Sauce they served on the side (thankfully) was awful and I ate more of it than I should, just to be sure it was terrible (I hope they get rid of it and invent a new one)!  Not to worry, my server consistently made sure I had plenty of the other Salsa they serve with the chips.\n\nHere is a place I had not heard anything good about yet wanted to see for myself (it has been a while and they could have improved if there ever was a problem).  My taste is different from some others, some of the time."
24639,0,"Y'know what? I usually try to go to a place a number of times before reviewing it. I was only here once an NEVER WANT TO GO BACK. It's just awful corporate \""Irish\"" BS! Their burger (Mushroom Swiss I believe) was $14! So much I remarked to my friend how excited I was to try this ridiculously priced burger...it was moderately OK. \n\nThey had a Tullamore Dew mirror but no Tullamore on the menu (Tullamore Dew is an Irish Whiskey), going back to the place being \""Irish.\"" I asked the manager about the whiskey and he had no idea what I was talking about.\n\nThe best part! They had a beer menu with domestics and imports. Imports were $1.50 more and Fat Tire was listed on there as a Belgian import. Now it is from New Belgium Brewing, which is located in that far of land of Colorado! Again, asked the manager about that, he had no idea what I was talking about."
11542,1,Way too expensive for the type of food they serve. Even the domestic micros are at least a dollar more expensive per pint than just about anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and take your dollars elsewhere where they will go much farther.
5518,0,"I wish I would have read the other reviews before going in.  I may have chosen to go somewhere else.  Clearly, good customer services is NOT a priority.  The food was okay but a bit overpriced, the beers were cold but the service was slow.  $25 of play at full tilt didn't warrant a single comp.  When I asked the bartender how much you had to play to receive a comp, she said $30. Since that is higher than ANY other place place I have been to in town, it might have been good information to give me.   I know that $25 is not a lot of play but I was never inticed to play more.  The bartender never asked if I was/wanted to be a member of the players club and never told us about any promos etc.   Also, it took about 10 minutes to get our change because the bartender was more concerned with the payout to the GM who was drinking at the bar.  It is unfortunate because this place has a lot of potential and is close to my home but I won't be back.  I am not sure how they stay in business since there were a total of 10 people at the bar from 9-11 PM on a Friday night and it is clear that they are not welcoming new customers."
43102,1,"So the last couple reviews I've done have been kind of negative. So, I've decided to keep this one positive.\n\nThey have a really nice patio! That is all."
46270,1,"Staff was quick, especially considering the line they had. I don't do coffee, so I can't speak to that, but the tea was good (of course it's pretty hard to mess up black tea). \n\nI don't recommend their hot food items though. I ordered the egg, ham & cheese croissant for $8. The outside was super hot, which I thought was a good sign. However the middle was cold & I am not a fan of cold egg. For $8 and a 10 minute wait I expected my food to be cooked through.\n\nI didn't have time to ask for a replacement because it was time for my plane to board, so maybe they would have done a better job the second time. If I ever end up here again, I'm define tell grabbing one of the cold items."
17720,0,"(originally posted this in late SEPT ... I checked back recently, and inexplicably found my review missing?!?!  What happened here, Yelp, did someone from teh show contact you and ask to remove my and my coworkers negative review?!?!?!)\n\nSpamalot in Vegas was miserable, just miserable :(\n\nSome background on me - big MP fan, love the Holy Grail movie, and for the most part I really enjoy broadway-type musicals (e.g., just saw Avenue Q in SF, it was hilarous & awesome!).\n\nI've been wanting to see Spamalot on Broadway ever since I heard about it last year ... from what I'd heard, the show was very well received in NY and was hilarious.  So when I found out it was playing in Vegas, I was stoked ... my only fear was whether or not the show had been \""vegasized,\"" but after reading the reviews on Yelp! that fear was allayed.\n\nWell, future yelpers reading this beware - this show is _terrible_, just absolutely bad ... and doubly so if you buy the tix at $100+ face value as we did :(\n\nI gotta think that the original production was nothing like the Vegas show (that much \""kitzsh\"" and predictible, bad jokes could never have gone over well, could it?!?!), and that they mukked with the show to make it more palatable to typical 50+ Vegas showgoers ... that's the only thing I can think (said crowd, btw, gave this show an inexplicable standing ovation ... unreal).\n\nShow had only two saving graces, imho - the \""lady of the lake\"" actress had a great voice, and some relatively funny lines; and the \""jews on broadway\"" number was mildly amusing.\n\nAnyway, strongly advise against this for MP and Holy Grail fans, and probably anyone else under 45.  OTOH, if you enjoy Vegas glitz and glam paired with obvious & predictable jokes, perhaps you'll enjoy this show as well."
13046,3,"Upon staying here, I wasn't sure what I was going to get based on the mixed reviews. I didn't get a GO room, but did get a deluxe room. This was a great choice, the room was updated, modern, and spacious with a view directly across from Caesars. I would not hesitate to stay here again because of the location and price, it's a good value for what you get. \n\nI can't comment on the food because we didn't eat here.\n\nThe casino area seemed to be on par with all of the other casinos in terms of amount of games and size."
33027,0,"Not sure I will go back.... I bought a 10 piece bedset about 11am this morning for $60, when I took it out of bag at 4pm to wash the sheets I pulled the comforter out and it had holes all in it. So I went back and they tried to blame me saying I washed it in washing machine when I did not.. So I grab another of the exact same one I bought earlier and I said can we please check this to make sure there's no holes then sure enough this one had holes. Well the manager proceeded to tell me that this was bound to happen with the microfiber material. So I said fine I'll get something else. So I picked out a different one looked at comforter (I didn't remove it all the way) and it was fine no tares or holes so I said cool. \n\nWell I just got home and opened the bag and it's missing 3 things!!! The sheets and two decorative pillows that the bag says should be in there. I mean seriously how lazy are these employees !!???"
29558,1,"Meh is right. I actually liked the dated decor. I did not like the dated staff. \nOur order was interrupted so that the server could check his tip from the next table. \nMy mashed potatoes came out of a BOX. Was served cracked glassware. I didnt enjoy my stay at Bally's steakhouse, and unlikely I will be back."
12171,1,"Although the place was not full to the brim busy, service was incredibly slow.  Close to an hour slow.\n Two of us ordered the West of the Andes which were reported as good.  One had the eggs and salmon which would have been better if it had arrived while the Bloody Mary still had ice.  Incidentally, poached eggs are not available probably because they might have fossilized before serving.  My Ace Burger was pretty good but not worth the wait.  There's a chance we might return but not a great one."
41090,2,"If you like hot cucumbers, you'd better get into OHSO fast, because I'd bet this place has a six month to one year lifespan. \n\nReally, hot cucumbers? My partner and I were excited to see OHSO from the street, and I was particularly intrigued with the \""Nano Brewery\"" moniker. Sounds great! Big disappointment. They are trying to be like St. Francis or The Vig, and it ain't working for them. \n\nAnd then I ordered a $12 or $13 \""flatbread,\"" which was a tiny square pizza with hot cucumbers on top of it. That's right . . . cooked cucumbers. Ugh!!! After scraping the cucumbers off, the balance of the chicken flatbread tasted OK. But like so many things on the menu here at OHSO, it was overpriced and uninspired.\n\nI like the beer list, but that's about it. Give it a little more intimate interior design, set up an outrageous happy hour, and this place could make it. But not like it is now. No way.\n\nEdited on Jan 3, 2015: We've been back. We really like the back patio there. Beer choices are great, not so much difference on food. I'd like a better happy hour. Bumping up by one star."
24665,4,"This is my first Korean spa experience, and I loved it. My favorites are the red clay ball room, the red clay dome room, and the ice room. This is a great experience if you just want to go somewhere away from the strip and relax. I will definitely visit again the next time I am in Vegas. Highly recommend."
10520,0,"If you like mediocre food, slow service (like really, really slow), and indifferent food servers, then this is the place for you.  Oh, did I mention they are also way over-priced?"
4685,0,"Poor customer service! I saw plenty of associates yet none of them even said hello. In fact I was the one who said hello FIRST to the \""greeter\"" lady at the entrance.  She sat there perched like a parrot the whole time. Why are you sitting there staring at ppl instead of saying, \""Hello and welcome to RC Willey are you familiar with our store?? I can help you or an associate can...\""something like that. Anyway, I decided to mention the bad customer service on the way out, (should've gotten a manager, and told him/her I know) and she gave a \""well some of the employees go home at 5:30pm.\"" I thought yeah and???  The good part was that she apologized for any inconvenience.  Thanks. As far as furniture, you can buy comparable, quality pieces for LESS from other nice stores in Las Vegas. Save your cash amigos...NEXT!"
39807,4,"Best taco I've ever had in my life.  PERIOD.  The price is so far below the astronomical prices of the Strip it isn't even funny.  Authentic, friendly and excellent food quality make this place the best and one of the cheapest meals I've ever had in Las Vegas.  Bravo!"
22861,1,"I have been to several Cracker Barrels, and expect pretty much the same quality food and decent service.  Tonight's experience was terrible.  Stephanie W, our waitress never refilled our glasses.  We had to flag her down, several times, to get her attention.  She brought only 2 biscuits for 2 people, and when we asked for more, she told us that was all we could have.  Soup was cold, we had to send it back. I think it was b/c she brought it late (after the entree was brought).  My grilled catfish was very small, and undercooked.  It was a lackluster meal, at best."
31200,4,"People who wine and dine at Mcdonald's get a bad rap. Why? Because people who don't dine at Mcdonald's aren't living and are therefore jealous. The truth is only about 20 percent of the population can full unlock the euphoria tunneled away in every bite. We are higher spirits of a different breed than the everyday jealous Mcdonald hater. \""Why you hatin\"" was perhaps invented to suit the likes of these people. For me and my intricate complex neurology, I realize what Mcdonald is was and will always be. That is perfection. It's only because we share this trait in common that we understand eachother. \n\nLove you Mcdonalds,\n\nOne of your equals"
42292,3,"It is worth going for the food.  Service was just so so; our server seemed confused when we asked questions about the food.  The water server was much more pleasant and happy than our table server.  I did not understand the ambiance of the place:  elegant food, modern decor, but the music was nonsensical noise; way too loud and I don't even know what kind of music it was.  Just didn't make sense to me at all.  I was served a glass of wine from a bad bottle and feel the server should have known it, or the bartender, as it was a Pinot Grigio and the color was orange!  My chair was also broken and it is a good thing I noticed it BEFORE I sat on it.  Other than that, it was great fun to eat and experience Chef Ramsay's food, finally!!!!  My husband had the steak, and it was cooked correctly, but the flavor was just average.  It needed a little pizzazz. Though, the lobster mac and cheese is unlike anything you've had before.  Just super creamy and cheesey!   I had the fish and chips, and it was delicious - the batter was very light and crispy.  The wine selection is limited, but you should find what you like on it.  The appetizer shrimp cocktail is amazing and fun to look at!  I've seen the steak presentation at other restaurants, so I knew what to expect, but I don't think our server was particularly helpful in that area......he seemed too distracted and rushed.  It is worth a try for a special occasion and if you have some cash to spend."
42097,0,I don't understand why this place is multiplying all around the city. The food is really poor. Noodle dishes are mostly noodles and oil. Rice dishes have the same sauce. pad Thai has very little but noodles. Save your money.
22491,3,I still love this place after all of these years. Its so nice to stop by and grab a cold one & I did while I waited for another show to start. Its such a great spot for people watching as well. I am glad that through all the changes at PH this is something that has not changed.
11755,2,We went here based on a random recommendation. The chips and salsa were very good. The food is quite hot.
45191,2,"Finally!  Lomo Saltado in Pittsburgh!!!\n\nThis place is great.  While I was at school in DC, one our favorite take outs was lomo saltado from the Peruvian place in Adams-Morgan.  I've searched for it ever since.  \n\nI have tried to replicate it at home, but to no avail.  And the green sauce that is used as a condiment is just as elusive.  \n\nI just found out that it was there, and have been there three times this week!  The Lomo was awesome.  Perfectly seasoned tender steak with red onions and fries over rice.  simply amazing.  THe Peruvian fried rice was tasty, but rather plain.  I was expecting a kick!  The chicken, of course was flawless."
8779,1,"I've been here about 10 times...and I only go when certain a certain bands play.\n\nPros: \n-Great that they welcome lots of local bands\n-Fairly good drink prices\n-Delicious Tom Collins drink\n\nCons:\n-They've \""lost\"" our debit card when we opened a tab. Or they gave it to someone else at closing. Not fun.(I've been told another friend had their card overcharged also.)\n-Their waitresses visibly hate it when you don't open a tab.\n-When not opening a tab, they take FOREVER to bring you bill.\n-Waitresses constantly get us brown-skinned people mixed up and even said, \""You all look the same.\"" (definitely not cool and a crappy excuse for bad service)\n\nIn summary, their drinks, location and entertainment are great. \nThe bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes.\n\nAgain, I'll go to the place but only when certain bands are playing. And if I go, I'll pay cash and sit at the bar."
1855,3,"My husband got back today from New Jersey (what a relief he isn't stuck in Hurricane Irene's path anymore!) and since we were in the neighborhood we figured we'd go to Over Easy.  Read my most recent review on how that went (ie, a bust.)\n\nWe stopped at Starbucks at the Safeway next to Over Easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what we'd do.  I turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was Taylor's Cafe open, they do breakfast, and they were only about a mile from where we were.  We decided to give breakfast one more try, called Taylor's and put our names on the list.\n\nWhen we arrived it was a little hard to find, but we called and they told us where it is.  The decor is cozy and inviting.  We waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied, the manager was very attentive.  I told him what happened at Over Easy and he was horrified.  We live in Avondale, we're willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service.  Let me tell you, Taylor's Cafe really turned the morning around for us!\n\nMy kids each ordered an apple juice, and one got chocolate chip pancakes, the other got strawberry waffles.  Their kids menu is $8 each, but the portions are huge, it's easily something an adult would put away.  I stole a bite from each, they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags.\n\nMy husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage.  With his omelet he got 2 choices for sides, so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese (he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese.)  The chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected.  He also ordered a mocha, which at $4 was about the size of what you'd get at Starbucks, and my husband said that it was on par with their quality.\n\nI ordered the Joe's special, intrigued by the list of ingredients.  It was flavorful and delicious.  The country potatoes were very tasty.  I ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade, it was tangy and sweet, really tasty on a hot summer day.\n\nWe came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good, but not out of this world.  They have fantastic options for the health conscious, and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear.  There is plenty of space (you don't feel like sardines in a can), the staff is polite, competent, and professional,  and the ambiance is nice.  We will definitely be coming back."
5875,3,Great find!  Visiting from DC and loved the unique take on menu!  Witty and original.  The food was excellent! Can't say enough about the pierogi sliders and the eggplant lasagna!!
40790,3,"Once upon a time a young Australian named Scott ventured to a far off land named Las Vegas. Scott had heard tales of magical machines that sometimes, but rarely gave you money if you pushed buttons on them for long enough. Scott heard of ladies that wore very little and drinks that were very large. He also heard tales of burgers the size of a small child and it became his quest while in this strange land to track down, and devour one of these famed burgers.\n\nNot deterred by the reviews of a mixed nature to be found on the magical tome known as Yelp, Scott set his sights on the Heart Attack Grill. Neon signs beckoned him forth. Posters in the windows told him that alcohol was good for him. Scott agreed. He stepped through the doors, with his beloved (and vegetarian) wife in tow, and was promptly greeted by a young lady in a nurses uniform. This was not like any nurse Scott had seen before. Nurses dressed in such skimpy attire in the strange land of Vegas. Upon being greeted Scott was cloaked in a surgical gown that no doubt had magical properties and was led to his waiting table.\n\nThe Grill was quiet, for it was late afternoon on a week day. Scott ordered a Double Bypass burger and when asked if extra bacon would be required Scott answered \""Yes, yes it will\"". Scott's wife, the vegetarian Leisha, simply smiled and ordered a large beverage of an amber liquid known as beer. \n\nBefore too long the burger had arrived. It was as large as the fables had told and Scott was quite pleased, though a little shocked. Scott was not expecting the food in this strange place to be of what looked to be good quality. The fries looked crisp and brown and tasted slightly of lard. Lard is good.\n\nThe burger glistened in the light. Scott looked around the room at the images on the wall that parodied films of yesteryear and smiled, then picked up the weighty burger with two trembling hands and took his first bite. It was good. Very good. Surprisingly good actually. This challenge would be a welcome one with such delicious treats on offer. Leisha asked Scott how his burger tasted as she sipped from her mammoth beer. \""Delicious\"" was Scott's reply through mouthfuls of juicy meat before diving back in. \n\nBefore too long Scott was halfway through his burger and he was beginning to falter. But Scott's will was strong. He could not return to his home in Australia letting this challenge best him, so he bunkered down and dove back in. The burger was rapidly decreasing in size, as Scott felt he was rapidly increasing in size. And then, with one almighty fist pump the final bite was downed and Scott was victorious. He was elated.\n\n\nAfter an appropriate resting time Scott rose to his feet and felt several kilograms heavier as he waddled to the door and the outside world with a grin on his face and a cow in his stomach. Victory was his, but it was not the poor gentleman's who was currently bent over a table being spanked by a nurse."
17686,4,"So I had heard of Oregano's before, and know it's a smaller chain in the valley. That said, when told we would be going here I wasn't suuuper excited. I'd never been to one, but had heard they were a pretty good place for Italian. \nWe went to this location because it was on the way home from the aeropuerto. As we drove up, I didn't even recognize it as being a chain-type place because it looked unique. It was jammin inside, so we ended up grabbing bar seats and ordering an appetizer to kill time and hunger. Once we made it to our table, we each got a different pasta dish and shared a little to sample other plates. I had the baked ziti, which was amazing. The 2 other dishes I sampled were great too! Great dishes, and nice, large portions...which creates more meals for the next day. Service was great at both the bar and our table. I loved this location (felt like a mom & pop place), and it even has a good size outdoor patio w/ heat lamps. I'm a fan!"
18804,1,"This place used to be one that I would look forward to visiting when I am on town. Unfortunately, when it is game day the food is mediocre at best and the service...well it is poor. Our server is no where to be found. Zipps should be called Zapps... When the crowd thins it doesn't get better. Next time I'll just go to Dukes."
16052,2,"We stayed here for a week over the holidays, we were in the 1 bedroom suite on the 20th floor.\n\nI loved that the hotel is non-smoking and did not have a casino, but, was still in the middle of all the action. It had nice linens, was very clean and the staff was great. I also loved having a washer/dryer in our room to bring home clean clothes and pack light. We vacationed as a couple, but, thought this was definitely a more family oriented place to stay.\n\nSince we were not owners, we opted to do the presentation to see if it was something we would be interested in. There was not any pressure at all, just a quick review of how it works and we walked away with all the information we need and two free tix to the Blue Man Group. It took about 45 minutes.\n\nCouple downers...there isn't a restaurant in the hotel and the bar is open only a couple hours. Drinks in the little store are pricey. The internet service was free, but, impossible to use it was so slow. Small pool and our room was missing the big tub we saw in the photos. The hotel overall just lacks the feeling of being in Las Vegas when you're inside. It is decorated nicely, but, I kinda expected a little Vegas!"
27256,3,"WHAT THE F**K DOES \""UNIDENTIFIED ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA\"" MEAN???!!! THERE'S NOTHING IN THE F**KING BAGGING AREA!!\n\nExcept the bag of course, but it's stil no excuse.\n\nRegular bouts of teeth grinding, fist clenching rage aside, this store isn't too bad, but is significantly smaller than the Tesco Express which is at most a 3 minute walk away. Convenient, but pointless if you'rre equidistant, or closer to, it's larger sibling."
2122,1,"I used to love this place back in high school, so I decided to drop in for a delicious protein smoothie. \nI ordered a medium high protein smoothie, and was absolutely salivating over the upcoming flavor as I hadn't eaten all day.\n\n Well my first disappointment came with the price, a whopping $10.00 for a d*mn medium smoothie! Holy cow! What are they adding to this to make it so god-like you ask? I have no idea, my only add on was friggin peanut butter, which was only a small dollop. \n\nMy second complaint was the service, although it wasn't awful, it certainly didn't entice me to ever want to return. \n\nI think I will stick with One Stop Nutrition, I can get the same exact smoothie, with peanut butter, for $5.00. \n\nI'm not trying to bring the gavel down on this place, but they certainly need to double check their prices, I definitely don't taste the quality or see the justification in charging an arm and a leg."
22021,3,"So we all know that Vegas becomes more pretentious by the day, leading up to full raunchy craziness on the weekends. It's exactly the same at Trevi. The waiters get better looking the closer you get to the weekend, the specials a little more glamorous, and the alcohol a little tastier. \n\nWe went two nights in a row, and the first night ordered so much food I actually had leftovers. The pizza I ordered was good but not great, but the bruschetta we ordered as an appie was outstanding. The bread was perfectly soaked with the juices of the tomato and the olive oil, and there was a lovely little palette cleansing salad to wash it down with. The only interesting part for me was discovering the mushrooms in the tomato mix... Seriously, fungi? Never have I had that in bruschetta before. Whatev. \n\nLast night, the waiter forgot to bring us our palenta fries, and when I asked him to take them off our bill and not bring them, he comped them, but brought them out as a bonus. See? Wasn't that nice? In Vegas, everyone's a winner!"
27186,2,"This is my local Chinese restaurant and it's nae half bad. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside or inside, the interior is pretty naff and looks dated - I would definitely rather eat their grub in the comfort of my own living room. I get the feeling that people don't come here for the d\u00e9cor though, it's the food that has this place full on a Friday or Saturday night. My sister will tell you that it's the best Chinese in Edinburgh: I don't rate it quite so highly. I always go for the shredded chilli beef and this is a dish that they have down to a tee: succulent pieces of beef, fried until it's nice and crispy then coated in a fiery chilli sauce, mmm mmm mmm. The prices are a little higher than average for a take-away and they haven't realised that some people would prefer them to not use MSG, but all in all the food is quite good as far as local, neighbourhood Chineses go."
26071,3,"I really enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere here.  My mom and I ate here for restaurant week and its was delicious.  The blackened brie is a definite winner as is the decadent hot chocolate dessert.  All the staff were very attentive and I also liked how the managers showed an involvement in the restaurant which is something you do not see all the time. Will defintely be going back."
2428,0,"If you're looking for a cold beer and appetizers this is the place. Plenty of ambiance in this old west facsimile, but stop there.\nOk, maybe impress your  out of town friends with the rattlesnake, but dont go any further.\nOur meal was atrocious!\nThe \""family\"" style salad provided us each a generous single leaf of lettuce and an entire cherry tomatoe...no refills!\nThe bread basket boasted of Indian fry bread on the menu, this however looked more like a turd of some sort, and tasteless to boot, (sorry about the pun).\nWhen I ordered up my bone in ribeye, I asked for it Pittsburgh style, the server had never heard the term. (And she wasnt new in the job)\nI had visions of a thick cut (it did say 20 oz.) of well done prime rib steak. \nWhat I got was a tepid piece of meat that was at least 8 inches in diameter and only about 3/4 inch thick, full of fat and, due to it being served almost lukewarm, the fat was beginning to solidify.\nIn their defense, the green beans were tasty, but I had to wait for our party of 7 to finish eating before making my rounds, inquiring, \""Are you going to eat your beans?\""\nYes, I managed to make a meal out of the green beans, since that was the only good thing on the menu.\nWhen we left, I noticed 3 tour buses in the parking lot with what appeared to be out-of-towners lining up at the entrance. \nI can only deduce that this place is still in business because of its promise of old-west lore and the charm that goes with the scenery and view.\nI will never repeat this horrid experience.\nOh, I did give it one star due to our extremely pleasant young server who was all too anxious to please...but God help her, even she couldnt fix this mess!"
43677,3,"Enjoyed a delicious dinner here last week. Friendly, knowledgeable staff,and good food. My salmon was excellent and my husband enjoyed the evening special - green chili stew."
35389,2,"ll the items on the menu sounded good, but nothing jumped out as \""must try\"". Our dinner reservation was at 8:30, but we got there early. The bar seats were all taken and the area didn't seem inviting so we went elsewhere for a drink. We got back at 8:30 and got seated at a dirty table. We ordered a sangria which was not great (I'm kind of a sangria snob). It was very  heavy on brandy or some other sweet liquor. We ordered the Tortilla Espanola and Artichokes and Clams, but they were both sold out. We ended up with the Spinach and Goat Cheese Croquettas, which we liked. We also ordered the Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp had great flavor), Calamari (ok, but lay off the mayo (aoili) served with all seafood), and Pollo Colonial (was the best). The portions were not small, but for the price, I'm not sure we were greatly satisfied. Overall, the experience was only ok."
5846,2,"It looks like a lot of people are split on Tom's.  Now lets get the obvious out of the way.  It is the Southside people, plus this is a late night diner, plus this is the SOUTHSIDE.  The diner is not in the greatest of conditions but the booths are big enough to seat a group of 6 which is great at 2am.  Be nice and your food will come out faster, at like a hooligan and you will probably be waiting a little longer.  But in general the food normally comes out pretty fast\n\nNow, to the food.  A couple things.  Stick to the breakfast, because it is good and nothing beats a good breakfast spot after a night at the bars.  The pancakes and breakfast sandwiches are my favorite.  \n\nSecond, I really thing they have a good late night gyro.  Don't ask why out of all the places in the Southside that I choose Tom's to get a Gyro, but they have an XTRA Large Gyro.  The moment I saw that on the menu, I just could not resist.  The end of result: I was good because it was a very large gyro, but the quality of meat was not of Mike and Tony's.  But I did not expect it to be great because it was so large and that was enough to satiate me at the time.  \n\nOverall, Tom's is your spot for a some good food and a place to go over the bad decisions you may have made earlier in the night."

Can't wait to come back and try the maryland blue crab!!\n\n**Update\nBlue crabs were great, very sweet... But worth it if you don't mind getting your hands dirty!\n\nMy favorite. Their snow crab, easy to get to and delicious!!"
47835,4,"I had a wonderful experience with my first class here! I love the decor and the instructor was extremely helpful and friendly. The prices are comparable to other yoga studios, but they do offer some specials. I cannot wait for my next yoga class!"
26766,3,"I like this location of the uber-popular green market chain. \n\nThis place is jumping on saturdays- there's a yoga class with full on loud chants (exciting)- no wonder, I saw some gals carrying their yoga mats. The best section has to be the complete Vitamin & Supplement sections (vitamins, protein powder, stevia, teas, and stress candy). Only two frozen food aisles- but they carry Hawaii's Bubbie's mochi ice cream at $7.99, Amy's frozen dinners and pizzas, desserts, vegetables and frozen dog food (who knew?). The body care section (Burt's Bee's, Pacifica) is impressive- from lotions, gels, face care, anti-perspirant, etc. The cleaning section is equally impressive- full line of Meyer's products (sprays $3.99) and Bonner 18-in-1 castile soap (two sizes $7.99/$11.99). Of course, the salad bar is very good- complete salad bar for $7.99/LB.- lots of yummy healthy options. There's a small seated booth section along the wall, to enjoy your salad, just past the cashiers."
25784,2,"This holts has a great selection of items, however the staff here were just awful. I was looking to purchase a bag and wanted to buy my first REAL high end designer one. While I've had money saved up, the amount I was looking to spend is still a lot of cash for someone that isn't overly wealthy. I found a Prada bag I was quite fond of and was debating that. The lady that was helping me was incredibly impatient and rude and kept telling me it was nice and I should just get it. When I decided to make a quick phone call she audibly sighed and walked back to the counter. While I understand I was looking at this bag for a solid 10 minutes or so, it's incredibly rude to have someone rushing you when they obviously just want to make the sale and get you out of the store. I ended up buying it, but it was definitely not the kind of experience I wanted to have while making such an important large purchase. Not everyone is made of money, and sometimes you gotta give them time to really look at what they're purchasing. It's not so much to ask"
17134,4,"Our \""Innovation Inspiration\"" meal and wine pairing was extraordinary!  The Mignardises last course was my favorite- I had a little bite of everything! Expect to spend 3 hours or more savoring each unique flavor!  This has to be the most amazing dinner I have ever experienced! Even for a Local!  There are many choices in Las Vegas, however, I HIGHLY recommend this as #1 for any hard core Foodie to enjoy the best of Culinary Diversity that Las Vegas has to offer! \n\nThe current Innovation Inspiration menu contained:\n\nArtichoke and Black Truffle Soup Toasted Mushroom Brioche with Black Truffle Butter.\nChopped Oysters\nSea Urchin\nCaviar & Champagne\nSalmon \nLobster\nFoie Gras\nDuck \nWagyu Beef\nMousse de Comt\u00e9- a Cheese flavor Foamy Soup and 3 Dessert Courses!

1875,4,"Bakers Nursery is where I've spent the majority of my weekend mornings.  I've either been pointed to a needed plant, or discovered it on my own.  Folks have always been helpful & informative.\n\nI will agree that they are pricey but big box stores cannot compare to the inventory at Bakers. Moreover, I'm do not agree with Yelp colleagues' low reviews. Unfortunately, gardening is 'at risk'. You figure out what your soil & attention span will foster and you are successful with those plants. Indeed, gardening comes with a learning curve that comes with failures & successes.\n\nTheir niche in the neighborhood will be a chasm after December."

15851,2,"Harrah's has a smart business module when it comes to Carnaval Court. It is situation on a pathway that sucks tourist in. With all the kiosks around, it has useless souvenirs within drunken reach. Even though my friends and I were not inebriated, we still bought those shirts that light up to the music. Thinking they were the epitome of cheesy tourist, we all bought matching shirts to signify our unity. \n\nEntering the party scene with our newly acquired garments garnered so much attention and compliments. The dance floor is large and provides enough room to get down. Being outside helps alleviate the overheating that sometimes occurs when the dance floor gets too crowded. \n\nThe flare bartenders are fun to watch and make a decent cocktail. If you want to alternate between partying and gambling, this is the perfect venue because they have table games set aside as well. It has everything someone coming to Vegas is looking for."
25213,3,"Dim lighting: check \nRegulars sitting at the bar: check \nImpossible to find parking lot: check \nDingy basement bathroom: check \nUnbelievably good food: check \n\nThe Bloomfield Bridge Tavern has all of the makings of a GOOD dive bar. There are divey bars that are dirty and gross where I would never dream of touching the food. And then there are the divey bars that are just grungy enough to give it character, and where you feel just brave enough to try the food, and you are so glad that you did! The BBT is definitely the good kind of dive bar. \nThe food here was way way better than I expected. The Polish specialties are spot on. By far the best perogies I've ever had, and the stuffed cabbage was incredible as well. I'm not usually one for kielbasa, but here it is a different story. Normally its greasy and chewy, but somehow at the BBT it comes out perfectly charred and super tender. \nThere is something very PITTSBURGH about the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern, and I will definitely be stopping back in the next time I'm in town."
44817,1,"Today was my first time trying it, it wasn't too bad but I've had better.\nThe service wasn't good at all, he messed up one of our orders and not once did he check on my table. \n\nFood was decent, service could of been better. Maybe it was just an off day for them. Overall decent place if your on the go and need a quick fix."
19358,3,A group of my coworkers and I go here every other week for lunch. FYI the blackberry lemonade is to diiiiie for- I order it every time we go. They have delicious healthy options to eat as well! Something for everyone
17513,1,"I took a friend of mine out for her birthday last Friday (May 9th) and The White Chocolate Grill was her choice.  Neither of us had been there before but the menu looked very intriguing.  The facility is stylish and intimate - better suited for couples than just friends - and we were seated quickly and courteously.  \n\nI ordered the Citrus-Soy Glazed Salmon.  It was over cooked and floating in far too much, and quite non-distinctive, juice.  I didn't finish it.  When the wait person asked if I wanted it boxed I honestly told her that \""it wouldn't be worth it.\""\n\nMy friend had the Blackened Mahi.  The menu indicates that it was 'grilled, topped with crab meat and a tomato Creole sauce\"".  When it arrived we both wondered where the crab meat was.  We envisioned something that would be at least visible.  She said that it was 'ok'.  I was probably more disappointed that she was because this was part of her birthday 'gift'.  \n\nFor desert we split the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake.  Although it was good I personally couldn't help thinking that is was just a 'dressed-up' Costco cheesecake.  \n\nThe wait person was pleasant but disinterested and didn't even put a candle in the desert even though she knew it was my friend's BD.  I raise this as an issue only because sometimes the wait person can make turn an unpleasant experience around by doing something 'special'.  But it apparently never occurred to her that she was an integral part of the 'dining experience.'  \n\nOverall, our experience at TWCG was mediocre and in this price tier Houston's has them beat 10 to 1!  Maybe it is a good place for happy hour and a desert or maybe it's a 'date value' thing but I won't bother with it again."
41517,1,I attended a private event here and I thought we would have the whole club to our self instead we had to share it with regular customers too which seemed really weird.\n\nWhen I checked in I was given a special VIP pass and told to have a good time.  I was also told that there were special VIP areas for me that I had full access too.  The problem was that all areas were roped off but I had no idea which side was VIP and which side was not VIP.  I found it kind of funny because with my VIP pass every velvet rope was lifted up for me.  Yes that is cool but what side should I be on.  It was a little confusing.\n\nWe also had passed apps and the staff serving them were really nice but it was some of the worse food I have ever had in my life.  I honestly could not even call it food...Costco samples tasted better then this stuff they were serving us.  I would have expected more from a location in the Bellagio.\n\nThe bar near the windows was also really packed and I could not get the bartenders attention to get a drink.  I then spotted a bar way on the other side and decided to see what was going on over there.  I had to go through two Border Patrol check points (guys with the velvet ropes) to get there and still had no idea if I could get a drink down there.  I asked the bartender and she said sure...okay things were starting to look up.\n\nI will tell you that seeing the dancing waters from the backside was unique.  It is also a closer vantage point then standing on the street.  My two stars are for the five star view.  The only thing I hated is that the non-VIP party had taken all of the best viewing areas and were clinging to the window where the water show was at.
28313,4,"Great food and it won't put a hole in your wallet.  I love the Spicy Beef Vermicello soup and the rice crepes, and the avocado shakes.  I can eat here everyday."
14018,2,"Been to Ghost bar a few times since 2003.\n\nHaven't had to wait in line, walking in each time. Polite staff, drinks are exorbitantly expensive though, but rationalize it as being a Vegas nightclub.\n\nThe view of the Vegas skyline is beautiful, albeit from a smaller than you think it is skydeck. If it's crowded, good luck getting a look at The Strip view.\n\nThey have a glass portion of the floor on the sky deck that freaks people out when they realize they are standing on a piece of glass that serves as the only protection from falling 50+ floors. It makes  a good conversation starter, especially when people are inebriated.\n\nProbably not a spot you will stay all night, but a good place to get in the Vegas mood before you head out to Tao or Pure. Expect a 30+ crowd, with 1990's hip hop. Call this more of a lounge than a true nightclub."
17112,3,"Easy to access, not a lot of confusing parking (you have your option between the garage or the street parking lot, both of which are literally right next to the Arena), and  is decently sized. Mainly hockey games and local graduations are held here. \n\nThe Box Office is a little farther away from the Arena than you might expect, but there is easy access to restrooms, and the price for food and drinks is at best what they should be for an Arena (not too expensive, but not too cheap, just the way you like it!) The seating is comfortable, and when events are hosted on the bottom floor, they cover up the otherwise ice rink they use for the hockey games with black flooring that you could still feel the coldness of the ice coming from (but it's actually a nice feeling!)"
47057,0,"Wow, the food here is horrible and the servers are lacking in every way possible. \n\nFirst off the food....disgusting, flavorless & underwhelming. I had the BBQ pork sandwich and it literally tasted like dirt, the cfc was bland and the gravy tasted like un -cooked flour. The pickles were actually descent, but the chips and queso tasted like nally's chili, which isn't a compliment. \n\nThe server was clueless on any question we asked. She over charged us on the food and drinks. \n\nThis lace is worthless in my opinion, and I hope it goes away."
13544,2,"We came here on our second night in Vegas after having gone to Tao the night before. There was a huge line as expected, but thanks to the almighty girl power we had in our group, we were able to bypass the line and get in.\n\nThere are a few different rooms with different music, and a rooftop deck; however, the club itself seemed a little smaller than Tao. They had lots of good music playing and had more options like house/techno on the rooftop. It was really crowded on the main floor, but some of the other dance floors like the Pussycat Lounge were pretty open. This is a pretty good club, and it doesn't seem as pretentious as some of the others like Tryst or Tao."
23689,3,"This is the best place, by far to eat on Mill. The chicken ceasar salad is phenominal. I'm very picky w/ my ceasar dressing & this one was perfect, not too fishy. Their margarita pizza is great. Since it is woodfired it may come out a little darker than you want so ask your server to have them cook yours for a shorter time if that bothers you. The service is great & love the ambiance."
4915,4,Bomb ramen. All the other food is delicious. Always worth the wait. They can always do most specials any day. Love the atmosphere and service. Never have been let down by this place.
27271,3,This is pretty nice for the money. It's sort of hard to find as you walk down the street. It's in a set of out buildings BEHIND the ones on the street and it's not too far from the high street so keep your eyes peeled. The trampolines are awesome. The jukebox is full of good tunes and the prices are very decent. Those kids will be very worn out. WIN.
26520,1,"This is a review of the bar at District, because that's as far as I made it there. \nI stayed at the Sheraton for work, and after my meeting, was looking forward to dinner at District. Being that I was traveling solo, I wanted to dine at the bar so that I could watch the college football games (I also think it's more lonely to dine at a deuce solo). It took the two bartenders about 5 minutes to acknowledge me (the bar is not that big) but once one did, he recommended me a good local draft beer at the happy hour price, despite it being about a minute after happy hour which was cool of him. \nI asked to see a dinner menu and was told 'I'm only allowed to serve the bar menu at the bar'. This differed from the experiences of others I read about on Yelp, and it pissed me off. The hotel is a business hotel. Your main clientele are business travelers, often solo diners. I've never gone to a restaurant where I could not get the full menu at the bar. The restaurant was at most, 2/3rd full so it wasn't as if the kitchen was slammed due to a huge rush. \nI chugged my beer and took off to Kincaids. Later that night, I relayed my experience at District to the bartender at the hotel lobby bar who also found it puzzling but said that perhaps a meltdown situation in the kitchen lead the bartender to enforce the limited menu offerings. Not cool with me."

14414,3,"A solid NY style pizza spot in the nondescript strip mall across the street from the Vig. It plays to the stereotype well, complete with the obligatory NY/Rat Pack memorabilia on the wall and thick Jersey accents behind the counter.  The pizza is solid but what sets it apart is the economics.  Two slices and a drink for $4 is alright  by my book."
24159,1,"Be prepared to drop some serious cash here at the Shoppes. (I'm wondering myself why they added an 'e' in shoppes - maybe for that added flavor of pretention, haha). They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd. \n\nMy friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, \""That one is $1400.\"" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says \""Okay,\"" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun!\n\nNothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself? \n\nFor the hard-working middle class schmo and \""normal\"" crowds, I recommend the Miracle Mile shops or Fashion Show Mall. I'm sure once the blazing summer heat kicks in, people will use this mall as an air-conditioned excuse to stay off the strip."
27359,0,"Some people may like Le Chariot. They might appreciate its charm and revel in rooting through all it has to offer to find great deals.\n \nI however, hate this place. It is effectivly a junk shop parading as a speciality items shop. A quick look on the window will have you spotting cool little things like military medals, collectables and other oddities, but once you get inside you will realsie this stuff is really just a load of old junk that nobody wants, yet the owner (a very grumpy old man, who frankly is rather scary) feels as though its worth a fortune, because that is what he charges for it.\n\nAfter spending some twenty minutes picking my way through a load of broken, damged and generally just crap stuff I spotted something I might have actually wanted - an old street sign that as far as I could tell had been stolen from a wall somewhere. I was told that it would cost me \u00a330, and when I refused the guy tutted and effectivly ignored me for the rest of my time in the shop. I later spotted it in the all intising window, along with the rest of the good stuff that the guy refuses to sell with a whopping \u00a345 price tag.\n\nAvoid this place, its all junk anyway."
33576,2,"Overhyped. Capriotti's has some good sandwiches and some that just don't connect.\n\nMy favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami, greasy pastrami grilled with melted Swiss, generously topped with creamy cole slaw and Russian dressing. Reubenesque and held together well by the bread.\n\nUnfortunately, that same bread is the reason why Capriotti's cheesesteaks and Italian subs don't work. The rolls on which its subs are served are hard and dense, which means they don't absorb the favors and moisture of the rest of the sandwich.\n\nThe cheesesteaks also suffer from meat that's grisly, dry and flavorless. Bland would be a word for it.\n\nThe Bobbie isn't my thing - I think mayo is gross, and without it the Bobbie sandwich gets unbearably dry. That being said, the store roasted turkey goes great on cold subs with provolone and hot peppers.\n\nJersey Mike's is better for cold subs and Pop's is the place to go in Vegas for cheesesteaks."
30377,2,"This place is always packed whenever I come here.  It's good, typical do-it-youself yogurt stand.  Nice staff.  I like that they have games here, it makes for a fun night out with the family."
21889,2,"This was a quick dinner pit stop during work travel. So personal disclaimer - I totally misread the sign and name. I thought I was walking into Rock Star Cafe. Don't ask why! I'm sure you can imagine my confusion when from the first second I was overwhelmed with the excruciatingly obvious NASCAR paraphernalia. I asked a server why a Rock Star Cafe would have so much NASCAR stuff. He stared at me oddly and pointedly handed me a menu. My co-worker had a nice laugh over my mistake. Thank you ladies and gents I'll be here all week!\n\nSo a few things, the food is not impressive but it's a better option than airport fast food. I ordered a bun-less veggie burger. It was not the best but certainly not the worst. Service is SUPER slow. We almost missed our boarding while waiting for the check to come out. Wait staff is mostly friendly but always looking frazzled. I didn't get that. They weren't that busy! My summarized assessment - Meh. Overwhelmed with the NASCAR shrine and underwhelmed with food. But then again that's work travel at it's finest!"
39993,0,"Quick review: I found the pizza okay, nothing to write home about. They have a few outside tables, which are really nice when the weather is good. \n\nThe problem, and it's a significant one, is the service. They have a walk up ordering system and every time I've been there, it takes forever for anyone to take my order. I've never been there when they've been busy. The final time I went there they had several people working there, but again, this weird kind of ignoring the customer thing was going on. \n\nI couldn't wait any longer and left. When they opened in that plaza, I was excited to have a new restaurant close-by. But now, I don't undergo the frustrating process of getting someone's attention to order there anymore, I just go to places where the entire transaction is pleasant."
12430,4,"Once you're on The Strip, you can't miss the large and domineering Las Vegas replica of the Eiffel Tower or the Paris balloon.\n\nThere's a ride that can take you in the elevator of the Eiffel Tower, and then there's the infamous Eiffel Tower souvenier cup. The Eiffel Tower souvenier cup is a must. A must I say! Boyfriend and I's IDs were checked, and the bartender noticed that my boyfriend's birthday was day of, so he doubled the dosage of vodka. Ouuvay! Guaranteed to make you actin' like you druUuuunk.\n\nInterior decor could use a bit more oomph tho."
3684,3,My friend lives right around the corner and after a little shopping we decided to stop in and grab some food. She ordered a turkey wrap and I got the turkey bacon melt.

5170,0,"If I could give this place NO stars, I would! The polishes are super cheap (I ended up repainting when I got home), waited and stood in the entrance while a rude worker directed where clients went and offered no open seating to the others standing in the front of the shop, nor cared.  ICE COLD water for manicure bowl, no base coat, high upsells on basic polish designs and asked for an additional $1 for using my debit card AFTER it was swiped and signed for (which mean lady in front of shop SHOUTED from her CHAIR to my Nail Tech, who was VERY nice... in the BACK of the salon). Hair and Nail Zone is Hair and Nail Drones... as the staff looked so unhappy to be there and I was, too! I'll NEVER BE BACK and I wish Tabitha Coffey could visit this place and turn them into a professional and organized business!"
28661,1,"I was quite happy when this restaurant first opened because there was finally an option for grabbing dinner before a Pen's game that wasn't the Souper Bowl (dirty, crowded, nasty food) or the Steelhead Grille (very,very expensive).  The decor is nice and upscale, and the food was consistently good, but the servers were hit-or-miss.   And the place was always packed before the games so we had to arrive early to get seated and enjoy our dinner.\n\nBecause of the NHL strike and other factors, we hadn't been to a game in 10 months.  Something very bad happened at Red Ring in those months.\nThe meal portions have decreased and the entrees we ordered just weren't as good as they used to be.  And, really, the meals are served in red plastic baskets with a lovely checked piece of paper underneath?  Are we at the beach ordering fried seafood?  Their presentation used to be quite good, now it's... plastic baskets.  And our server was one of the worst we have had in our 3(?) years of eating meals there.\n\nWe noticed as we were leaving that there are no longer lines of people to be seated, and it made sense.  Many of their former customers are going elsewhere-- but WHERE?   We will probably not be back unless our only option is the Souper Bowl..."
4114,0,"I work a Arrowhead in a smaller store so before work I decided to go shopping. I've been looking for a new watch and purse since I already got my taxes back. I went to the Michael Kors watch counter and the sales lady was helping some woman who said she was looking around, the woman was flashing hundred dollar bills in her hand, so I looked around. When that woman left, she completely ignored me and started doing paperwork even though I made eye contact with her and said hello. I'm only 18 and I look very young so I'm often passed by sales people because they don't think they'll get a sale.  well, I was going to give you a $300 dollar sale but I guess not now, people should stop judging by my age.\n\nAfter the stupid watch sales lady, I went to go look at some handbags. Where again, no one helped me even after I said hello and expressed interest. Step up your game, Dillard's. I, myself, am a sales associate and I know when someone is interested in making a purchase.\n\nThe atmosphere of this Dillard's is just crap now. I saw two beauty counter associates talking about an older Asian lady because she couldn't speak English and they couldn't understand her. They were laughing and ignoring her.\n\nThe amount of booger picking kids running a muck here is mind boggling. Watch your damn kids."
26260,3,Nice coffee shop located close to the casino and guest elevators.  I stopped in the other day to get an Italian Soda as an afternoon pick me up.  The staff was friendly and the raspberry italian soda was delicious...although a little bit pricey at nearly $6.
20025,4,I went in to find a battery for my son who has an old Galaxy S.  The staff was very friendly and helpful in helping me find the correct battery.  I looked around and was surprised to see all of the different items they had in their store.  As I was waiting to check out the lady behind me started talking to me and mentioned how much she liked this store because of previous experiences she had there.  I would highly recommend Yes of Course for cell phone needs and will be returning there again.

31473,3,"Decided to go here the other night on a whim, couldn't decide where we wanted to eat and we've seen it tons of times from the Beltline.  Pretty busy when we got there and continued to stay busy while we were there.  Our server wasn't great.  She lacked conversational skills and didn't seem interested in being there.  The menu had great variety and we started with the blue cheese potato chips appetizer and they were great.  I had the ribs and I thought they were good.  We got to sit right by the kitchen and while it was fun watching them cook and feeling the warmth of the fire, it was odd having a ton of servers huddled around waiting for their food.  I liked the decor and ambiance and would definitely like to try it again."
11827,2,"I was extremely disappointed with my recent stay. The room I had was very dated, furniture and light fixture from the 80's.

I guess it's true you get what you pay for !!!!!"
12353,0,"I would not recommend this hotel at any price, any rate. They have the WORST customer service of any hotel I have ever spoken with. I made a reservation in JUNE 2010 for reservations in OCT 2010, my rate was 105/night. Great! I called to see if I could change to sat/sunday night stay instead of friday/saturday night and was told that my new rate would be $250 per night. Seriously? I am staying the same night, but am asked to pay more? I asked to speak to a supervisor, was not allowed to actually speak to one and was told there was nothing else that would or could be done. \n\nThis is a terrible place for customer service and I refuse to frequent a hotel that treats its customers in this fashion. NYNY: learn how to treat people with dignity and get some real managers! \n\nRECOMMENDATION: DO NOT STAY HERE!"

Packed up my 400 lbs of copper and brass and went a couple miles up the street and actually received a fair price for my scrap. Would not recommend these guys to my worst enemy."

I've tried poutine in Vancouver before and I didn't see what the hype was all about but the poutine at this place is AMAZING!\n\nI highly recommend the original.  Damn the beef in it is sooo good that I'd snuggle with it! I tried the sweet potato poutine too which sounds kind of weird, but it was pretty good and wasn't weird at all.  And they open late...hooray for an after drinking snack."
23940,2,"For those looking for a rowdy night on the town in a college setting, a very diverse crowd or you simply want to cheer on the Sun Devils, this is your spot. Mill is lively, it's got a lot going on, the streets are lined with restaurants, bars and shops and your bound to leave Mill with a story. But, if you aren't ready for a Vegas-style night in a very young (early 20's) setting, this might not be your spot. \n\nLike Emma W said, I am also reviewing Mill as a whole. I have been to several places on Mill that I like and several that I dislike. For those reasons, I am giving it a solid three stars. \n\nI like restaurants such as Canteen, Cafe Boa, Gordon Beirsch, Rula Bula, La Bocca and a couple others. I'm not a fan of any of the bars on Mill but was and would be if I was still in college or in that mind set. If I was going to visit a bar on Mill, I would go to the Big Bang piano bar for some live piano music, but be warned that it gets really crowded. I like that Tempe Town Lake is near the Mill District and they host lively concerts, block parties and races. They also have sail boating and paddle boating. And finally, I like that Mill Ave has a lively vibe where I know that no matter when I visit Mill, it was always have a group of interesting visitors. \n\nI don't like how dirty, crowded, rowdy and out of control Mill can get on any college game day or at night. I try to avoid Mill at night at all costs because like I mentioned above, I'm not college age anymore. If you go to Mill, I suggest you go during the day or if you go at night, be prepared."
37200,3,"I must be a snob when it comes to bakeries, because I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be. They had a beautiful selection of cakes, pastries and macaroons but unfortunately not much caught my eye. I did however love the plain and chocolate croissants and my boyfriend loved the two pieces of chocolate cake. I would have loved a bigger selection though. There was almost an entire cold case filled with macaroons, and for someone who doesn't much like them, I wish there had been more pastries and cookies."
30199,1,The food was actually pretty tasty but the service I received spoiled the whole thing.  In this economy I'm not spending $8 on a 6 in. sub to be treated rudely.  I can go to Port of Subs or Capriotti's to the the same quality for less.

18608,4,"I have to say that we love looking at architecture design, so having learned about Taliesin West, we knew we had to check this place out while we were in the vicinity. Soooo glad we did, because this place is amazing! I could try and tell you about it, but like most architecture, you have to SEE it to understand and/or appreciate it. \n\nI can tell you that my favorite part of this place is the Sculpture Garden...so many amazing forms and figures upon which to gaze. Truly beautiful stuff!\n\nI have to admit that we lucked out, because as many folks have already pointed out, there is a fee to take the tour. However, because Hubby's uncle is a catering manager, he's overseen many catering events that have been held at Taliesin West. Because of that, our group of four was allowed in for free to follow him around pretty much every nook and cranny of the grounds. It was all very informational and educational and enthralling.\n\nThumbs up to the staff, who were all very nice and courteous and had no problem letting us go into areas that the tours did not visit...altogether, a great experience! :)"
28049,1,"So i had bottle service and it was super fast and easy to get in. Once in and seated at my table i went exploring. The outside area was super nice with the pool and cabanas. The outside wasn't too crowded and was easy to get to and from area to area. The inside was horrible!! I tried walking inside to get my friend who was at the bar and it took me 30 minutes to get to the bar! I felt like i was in a moshpit, people throwing elbows and pushing and shoving just to get out of the giant crowd. Never again, if i go back to xs ill stay outside. The reason this got a 2 star review was because of the bouncers. They are douchebags. Just because they can accept tips doesn't mean they have to strong arm people to give them tips. I had three of my friends leave because a bouncer kept asking them to tip up or they'll be escorted out for freeloading. Wtf?"
36556,2,"I purchased a bunch of Groupons (yup, I'm a cheapie, NOT, just resourceful), and currently staying here for my business trip.\n\nThe hotel is nothing like the Bellagio or Wynn (which I stayed during previous trips to Las Vegas), but I'm not a hater, but not a lover either of this hotel.  If it wasn't for business or the awesome Groupons, I probably would never have considered this place.\n\nThere's an awful smell of smoke as you enter the lobby, probably because the \""casino\"" is adjacent.\n\nBut let's talk about what I have.  The King room is big with a mini-fridge (great), microwave, single person couch, work table and chair, large windows and fair amount of space.  The bathroom is clean, sink is outside of the bathroom.  I like that idea.  Large flat screen TV.  FREE wireless internet, great so I can login and work at no charge to me or my company.\n\nThere's a little fitness room on the 2nd floor, I couldn't find it initially and asked for hotel staff help.  They are friendly I should say.  There are a couple of bikes, an elliptical that doesn't work, a stairmaster, 2 treadmills and some free weights and nautilus type equipment.  The equipment is not the high end precor or lifestyle type, but it works, and I can get a little sweat, not to say that Las Vegas isn't steaming at 105-110 during my stay!  It's HOT.\n\nThere's a pool, but haven't checked that out yet.  I'll do that this weekend, get some rays and tan.\n\nParking is self-park by the way, no valet.\n\nWill I come back?  Yes, because I have Groupons to use!"

Now in retrospect I think I have bought all of my swimsuits here for the last 6 years. Hey back off they carry speedo's for about 20 bucks now that's a deal! \n\nI love the shrimp cocktail here I get that at least once a week you get like 30 beautiful shrimp for 10 bucks with sauce and lemon. The chicken salad is very good. I always get, french beans & hard salami as well. The prices for the cheeses are really good as well. \n\nI get my puppies dog food here too! You can't beat the ready made food either. The roasted chicken is fantastic! The cuts of beef are amazing. Sometimes about half way through my shopping I will call the food court and order an everything pizza. Once I go to the checkout I let them know I ordered a pizza and they ring me up there and I go pick it up on my way out. Also the twist frozen yogurt is yummy! For 10 bucks that's a good pizza! \n\nDo park in the back on the montebello side, or if it works for you take the light rail."

She handed some food over to a customer and the customer gave it right back saying it was the wrong order. She yelled for her coworker and this other lady came out to assist the situation. They discussed the issue while I was still standing there, at this point I was debating leaving. One of the ladies finally said she would be right with me, so I didn't leave.

The atmosphere was great and walking around the District afterwards is always fun .\n\nWe returned in February 2014 for dinner again, this time I ordered a steak and he ordered a seafood medley. The seafood was great. The steak - bad. I ordered it pink/medium and it came well done and dry.

4102,3,"I love the furniture here! We went in looking for a coffee table and a large ottoman.  Pricey but all of the pieces are unique. Place was not busy and sales people did not circle you like road kill. They also didnt say hello, so I took a star.

Didn't find the perfect piece today."
38200,2,"Good food but really quiet for a Vegas joint.  Not bad if you're looking for a romantic or quiet place but definitely not a \""fun\"" place.

10054,1,"Why did I even come here, this is a big ass tourist trap to begin with and I knew it, I have been to the one in Time's Square for Peet's sake, the beer were expensive, I had the wings and it was barely tolerable as it didn't really have a real flavor to them.  The only decent things were the service, the big screen TVs with sports on them (this is ESPN Zone after all) and free wi-fi, so supposedly you can do work.  Just skip this place there are far better places to enjoy a game while in Vegas."
30114,2,"When I was in line for 20 minutes for this place I noticed Yelpers had a lot of bad things to say.  Well it was not that back.  Just a typical buffet.  Some of the food was cold and some not that good.  But they have some items that was really good and the crab legs and shrimp is a good addition.  The drinks too a very long time to get to us.  We waited for about 5 minutes for a waiter to come over to get our drink order before we even went to get our food.  The drinks came when I was almost done with my first plate.  I hate not having something to drink while I eat.  But the facility is updated and looks nice.  Overall, it was what we expected."
25227,1,"Came here late at night.  Late menu looked decent.  Prices were decent.\n\nFood was mediocre.  My steak was very dry and tasteless.  I asked for medium it came out well done.  The fries were wonderful however.  The pulled pork benedict was just a bit weird.  It didn't really work.  \n\nThe service was nice, attentive, and the decor is nice.  There have to be better late night options in the Wynn than this place.  We were going to walk down the street, but were simply too lazy.  Probably should have just ordered room service."

I got the Tommy burger (bacon & bleu cheese) with Cajun Fries and it was deeelicious!  It's a great location with yum yum food and friendly service so I'll return.  The only thing on my wish list would be a more exciting beer list.  The beer list wasn't bland - it had things I hadn't tried - but it wasn't special like Carly's."
3605,2,"Taking a chill out on Chili's. My friend and I frequent this location usually once a month, occasionally more, & always sit in the bar area. Our favorite is the Presidente Margarita. YUM!!! This has become the staple of our visit and often times, the reason we choose Chili's. We were very excited to hear the margaritas were being featured on a dinner for two deal - perfect! Except that choices, well, kinda suck. The steak wasnt good, and since we dont get the combo. Upon our most recent visit, we both noticed that we were definitely shorted on our margaritas. Asked the server/bartender Jake, whom we've had before several times, if the recipe has changed and he swore it hadn't and said that it must have been that every single time before it was made incorrectly. He told us how he makes it and we reminded him that he's made our drinks for us on multiple occasions. The thing about Jake is that he is so super cheesy, he wouldn't admit it anyways. He should work with kids and families, not bar folk. We both felt insulted and disappointed that the margs we have to come to love so much can no longer fill our glasses two times. Not sure we'll be coming back. Def gonna take some time out to chill."

Normally a place like this you would think they would check the bathroom each other but who knows if they even clean this every day.  I did bring this to their attention when I checked out."
20101,2,"I just returned from Las Vegas.  Apparently Southwest Airlines uses Showtime Tours because when I booked my flight and hotel  I also paid for a round-trip shuttle to and from the airport. I was automatically assigned to Showtime.  The trip from the airport was excellent.  The shuttle was waiting and the driver was great. Got to my hotel in no time.  On the other hand, the return to the airport is another story.  I called 24 hours ahead of my pickup just like they suggested. When I called she asked what time was my flight I said 8:30am.  She said we will be there at 5:10am. Are you kidding???   I asked her to repeat what she said.  She said \""we will pick you up in the front of your hotel at 5:10am.\""  When I asked why so early she said \""please be in front of the hotel at 5:10 am  and if no one is there within 15 minutes of that time call us.\""  At 5:30 am the shuttle arrived.  At  5:50 am I was sitting in the airport with 2 1/2 hours to wait.  I figured the reason they get you to the airport two hours before your flight gives them one last opportunity to get whatever money you have before you board the plane. So what did I do.  I sat in front of a slot machine what else?  The only thing that made the 2 1/2 hour wait worthwhile was the jackpot I hit just before they called my flight."

It catches you off guard at first, but now I have grown to really dig the tone it conveys.

13431,3,"I went to Le Cirque with insane expectations.  Being only my second dinner at the Bellagio, the previous one at the amazing Picasso, I had anticipated this dinner quite a bit.  In the end, I was disappointed.\n\nWe went in a party of 7.  When we sat down, menus were provided, but we knew immediately we were doing the tasting menu.  We raised some special needs with our waiter, and he provided several possible substitutions for certain dishes that did not fit the constraints.   He suggested a truffle rosotto over the scallop and mushroom.  Instead of john dory, how about rabbit, or chicken (really?), or filet?  \n\nWith the menu decided, bread was served.  The bread was excellent.  There were three or four different breads in each basket.  The highlight was something I've never seen before: fat, soft pretzel bread.  It was like having a soft pretzel in bread form.  It was great.\n\nThe first course was a lobster salad, but I don't eat shellfish.  Instead, I was given a nicely presented traditional salad.  It was okay.  Nothing very exciting, though the tomatoes were excellent.\n\nThe second course was a sauteed foie gras with dried fruits and hazelnut.  A classic combination, again, tried but true. This was excellent, though I think I've had enough foie gras for a couple years from this one dish alone -- it was not lacking in quantity.  \n\nThe next course was the risotto.  Again, the menu called for a scallop and mushroom, but I opted for a truffle risotto.  Boy, did it have truffles.  The entire mini sauce pan in which it was served was covered with large flakes of truffle.  I've never seen that much in one place.  The risotto was good.  The truffle tasted like nothing.  Yes, there was enough truffle to take many bites of just truffle.  I simply didn't understand it.  I suppose truffle is best appreciated through the nose. Other members of my party who ordered the scallop rosotto preferred theirs over the one with truffle. \n\nThe next dish was the jon dorry.  It was fine.  Interestingly, it was served with a red wine sauce, which I do need to give the chef props for.  That was unique to my experience.\n\nThen, the lamb.  I am having a hard time remembering it, again.  The waiter did not ask for our temperature preference, and as such everyone's came our medium/medium well.  That alone was not so impressive.  I do recall that it was the cleanest frenching I've ever seen on a chop, though.\n\nWith all the courses over, our waiter asked us if we'd like dessert.  We say yes, order some coffees, and by the time the coffee is served, the waiters all come out with 7 different desserts prepared, one for each person (a surprise!).  We played a game of Pass the Dessert and got to try them all.  Each was quite large.  The best was probably a coconut/mango ice cream served in a coconut.  Other offerings included two souffles, a strawberry shortcake, and others.  On top, we were provided petit fours.  Again, nothing truly amazing.\n\nIn all, I found the food pretty generic.  It was solid, no doubt, but not creative.  Nothing elicited a \""wow\"" except, perhaps, some of the portions.  I feel like the kitchen was playing it safe with this menu.\n\nI must compare this restaurant to Picasso.  The experience pales in comparison.  Add on top of that that the menu is $145 per person ($40-$50 more than Picasso) and then another $14 per person for the truffle substitution (and for what, exactly?), and one wonders what the value proposition here is.  \n\nPerhaps my anticipation got the better of me, but in all, I can't fully recommend this restaurant.  I think there are better choices out there."
33116,3,"Isn't this the worst name ever for a furniture store?  When people ask me where I got my great sectional and I say the Furniture Warehouse on Bell, they say - which one?  Anyhow, this little gem is located right next to J & K Furniture to the west in what kinda looks like an old barn now.  It's basically an over sized \""Tuff Shed\"" and when it's hot outside - it's still hot in here.  I've been here when an awful storm kicked up and it was an AWESOME place to just listen to the rain fall.  But anyhow - back to the furniture.\n\nWe got a sofa here that was selling at Mor Furniture for less for approximately double.  At Mor there was just one fabric choice, here I got fabric and pillow options.  They also had \""cousins\"" of that sofa - both the fancy duck down pillowed one and the super basic foam filled one.  So I could have gotten an upgrade, played with fabric options and still payed almost $1K less.  Oh yea....\n\nThey also have some great kids beds/furniture, some really cute dining room furniture and of course other cool sofas.  The service was really outstanding.  When I remembered seeing an Ottoman that was no longer there, they pulled out 6-7 different catalogs of stuff to try to find them, pulling in an owner and manager to make sure they did everything they could to make sure I found just the right cheap ottoman.  They even called a few of the manufacturers to make sure the leg styles were going to match.  Very good service.  And awesome prices.  Their selection can be a bit limited because of it's size, and they won't have it all in stock of course because things generally need to be ordered, but we had a good experience with that as well.  Definitely worth a look if you're in the market."
13855,1,"Throwing an amazing party is not easy, I give them that. Tao, similar to other popular hot spots Rain, Tryst, Prive and clubs of the like, are so overcrowded that it's hard to enjoy yourself. Tons of people get on the guestlist, and those who aren't usually have to wait in a long line. When you're working at the door, the last thing you want to do is turn people away or make them wait. Trust me, I know the feeling. \n\nWe had a group of 12, and it was really hard for us to stay together. Even though we were on the guestlist, only the girls got in for free. Guys had to pay a $20 cover. Had we planned things out so that we had table service, we would have gotten our own roped off VIP section. Instead, we took our chances and unfortunately were packed like sardines on the dance floor. We made the best of it, and I ended up having a great time dancing, even though I was bumpin' and grindin' with people on all sides. \n\nJessica and Nicole got separated from us, but I found them standing near the window trying to look for us. They had gotten themselves into the VIP section next to boxer Bernard Hopkins who was in town for the fight. They took me back there, and we hung out there for a while. When our guy friends found us there, they were denied entry. That's when we decided to leave. While the rest of the group stayed and checked out Tao Beach upstairs (which was just as chaotic), we decided to call it a night. \n\nAs we walked down to the restaurant, they had cleared the area out and there were hardly any people down there even though there was another DJ spinning there and the bar was less crowded. We probably could have gotten the rest of the group to come down and hang out with us there, but we were pretty much over the scene and took off. \n\nYou'll find a lot of hot women put on display throughout the club. Although they are gorgeous girls with hot bodies, it was a bit disturbing to see them sitting in rose petal filled bathtubs and getting massages. I think what made it degrading was that they didn't look happy to be there and be stared at. I guess it's their choice, right?"
3024,1,"I came here because I've heard good things about the reverse happy hour, although it was for the Gilbert location but since we were closer to this location we made the mistake of coming here. I asked to sit close to the fish tank so my daughter could enjoy the view and was told if we wanted to partake in reverse HH we would have to sit elsewhere. We were told we could sit on the other side at the only open table in view (still dirty) and proceeded to seat ourselves. After several minutes of waiting my daughter politely asked for our table to be cleaned. Our server finally appeared, our drinks and food came out at a snail's pace. The chicken satay over a slaw was good, peanut sauce good(have had better) whatever the other sauce was, awful. The apple brie and pepperoni flatbread were ok but quickly became cold because the air conditioner was on so high you'd think it was summer outside. Average food with poor service, the only reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1 was the nicest gentleman whose job only appeared to be to bus tables was polite to my daughter & myself, was personable and was the only one who genuinely seemed happy to be there. He deserves a mention, the tips and a raise. We might try hh again at Kona but definitely not at this location!"
4449,0,"I'm always at Smith's Grocery store in the same plaza and am always curious about this place, so when my parents were in town visiting, I suggested we check it out because it just looks HUGE from the parking lot and plaza.  Umm not the case. It's a really small casino, and you're lucky to get a machine. We went on a Wednesday night and found it difficult to find one. Stayed maybe 15 minutes and decided to head to Sunset Station. Won't be back."
28731,4,"The people who work at Dutch Bros are seriously the cutest, sweetest baristas, ever. Definitely a funky, party kind of vibe. Wonderful coffee, great service."
46695,3,"WOW!  Oleana is a great massage therapist!  I was skeptical walking in.  You never know what you are going to get at some of these little massage places that are just one room in an old house shared with other businesses.....but she seriously is amazing.   I only had time for a 30 minute massage, but I will totally be back for another.  I left feeling completely relaxed.  \n\nShe shares a waiting room with a few other businesses.  Then her massage room is upstairs.  The massage room is very comfortable.  She had nice music playing and a heated table, which is a must for me in a massage!   My only suggestion would be to have more comfortable chairs in the waiting lobby area. \n\nOleana had very soft hands, which is something else you want in a massage therapist.  Rough hands are never good and can be distracting.  She went over my health history sheet and we talked about what problem areas I had.  She listened well and followed through on the massage.  I would totally recommend this place to others.  And she is very reasonably priced!"
1645,2,not impressed. My salad was $17 for lunch!! and also NOT WORTH IT. Very pricey for what you get.
41886,0,"Thinking I would play it safe my first time here, I ordered the Asian Steak Salad.  You can't ruin salad, right? Bleh! The steak was a cheap cut that was chewy and fatty. The mandarin oranges tasted like they came out of a can and the lettuce was wilted. Oh the apple bread was stale. Won't be paying a visit here again which is too bad as I live within walking distance."
24904,3,"Vegas casinos boast some good mid-range burger joints, BLT Burger, Le Burger Brassiere (at Paris hotel), and of course the Burger Bar at Mandalay.   I wish I could differentiate between the three, but they are all quality eats IMO and worth checking out.\n\nBLT Burger is located w/in Mirage next to a busy walkway and often doesn't have big lines or a wait due to the neighboring food joints.   All I've ever had here is the #2.  Forget the name, but its the blue cheese and caramelized onion burger... with of course bacon added.   Always cooked to perfection.   Dripping in juice of course.\n\nWhat's keeping this from a 5-star place is that I've never been thrilled with the fries or onion rings.   I also wish there were sweet potato fries (ala Burger Bar) but all in all, minor complaints here.  Service is attentive and good.  Central location.   Reasonably priced of course.   Worth checking out especially if you're in the neighborhood."
39384,3,"A regular haunt of Friday-nite Aruba Swings patrons a few doors down, Viva Las Arepas fueled dancers needs for good food and energy. Having been both to their old shack location, and their now storefront location, their arepas are wonderfully delicious and filling. The guy at the counter always laughed at (with) me when I ordered since I can't pronounce it right, but I get the veggie arepa and the cold arepa with chicken and avocado. The wait isn't long, and they make it when you order it. Better than fast food! Try their mango and passionfruit drinks too!"
36909,1,"Dear Dunkin Donuts,\nWhen someone orders \""coffee\"", they want \""coffee.\"" You know that pot filled with delicious hot dark brown caffeine water!? Yeah that stuff!! That's \""COFFEE\""!!\n\nIf someone wants \""iced coffee\"", they'll ask for it. There's no need to ask every customer if they want their coffee hot or iced. \n\nNow that we know the basics, let's work on it! Don't give your customers iced coffee when they order coffee. It's their one chance for the day and you better not screw it up, it's coffee after all, how hard can it be!?\n\nYours Truly,\nThe Customer with unwanted ice in his coffee!"
49021,0,This is by far the worst restaurant in Las Vegas. \nI am from Argentina and also Italian. Both combination of food were absolutely horrendous.\nService I snot only slow but cheap and almost not existent.\nI am for sure that the other reviews are internet or some friend of them. It was the most discussing food in my life.\nEverything was reheated and old. \nPlease do yourself a favor and go to McDonald ....it's way better..ugh!
10660,3,"Nice! OK, yes expensive but when the food is really good and the service TOP NOTCH, It's on my list of favs now....had foie gras and au gratin potatoes and choc souffle, au gratin a little boring, everything else-yum yum"
26898,0,"I'm not one to judge pub food, because I don't eat it often. However, I am more than displeased with the food I ate at Burgundy Lion. I lie crouched in my bed right now suffering from a stomach ache, which was not there before I ate at B.L. It's sad, because I was really looking forward to eating at this place with friends; but between the lousy service and day old meal, I was ready to leave. The servers accidentally elbowed me in the head too many times; they forgot to put the order in for brussel sprouts and bacon, so I waited more than an hour for my meal; the fries were stale, the gravy was rancid, the codfish cakes tasted as if they were frozen like they thawed them in the deep fryer, and I think the sausage role is the reason why I'm in this state. The only thing worth getting is the house beer and don't get me started on how dry the Angus burger is. I was with a friend who is a burger fanatic and she was not touching that thing! The worst part is that you're paying so much for a meal that you didn't even enjoy. I've had meals at five star restaurants in Spain that were cheaper than this joint. Overall, this place is overrated and overpriced! Go at your own risk!"
33357,1,"Let me preface this by saying I am a freak about cleanliness when it comes to nail salons. I recently moved here from Seattle where I went to the \""natural\"" nail salon, Julep so my standards are pretty high. I chose this one based on being voted Ahwatukee's favorite nail salon. I walked in and was greeted promptly. I was told to pick out my color but they didn't the color I wanted...surprising. I felt a little rushed by the guy at the front and then when I settled on a color he grabbed my Starbucks cup himself to take it to the station - it had a straw sticking out and he grabbed it by the top. I was immediately taken aback....I'll take my own drink thank you very much. The manicure was good enough...the tech wasn't very friendly, in fact he seemed annoyed they whole time. I did not see where the instruments came from, they were not in a bag, but just sitting there.....therefore I cannot tell if they had been sterilized. The station was a little dirty, not washed down from the previous client and when I went to dry my nails, where you place your hands under the light was in desperate need of a good wiping down, you could literally see crud stuck onto it from other's before me. Ewwww. The manicure was really nice but based on my experience I won't be returning here."
9789,0,"This place used to be great back in the heyday. Every time I would go on the hunt for gauges in the area (since I used to live relatively close to this location), they always seemed to be out on some sort of make or model of gauges I would want. I've also noticed a lot of their gauges don't come in pairs, and generally are missing or out of stock completely. If you're lucky enough to get a good pair that's discounter it could work to your benefit on saving money, but other than that this location has really fell in business and in service. What was a little aggravating is that the person I talked to in regards of spiral gauges didn't even know what a spiral gauge was or what they looked like. Really, now?\n\nI don't believe you should deserve to work at a tattoo shop if you have no idea what you are talking about or you fail to answer questions that are centered in your department."
24636,1,"We passed by the Sandbar & it looked cool & fun so we decided to stop by for dinner with our family. The previous reviews are right, it's more of a bar than a restaurant. It has a great beach bar atmosphere. It would be a cool place to hang out with friends if you are just going there to have fun & snack a little but if you are going for dinner I will advise you that it is more than just 1 $ in rating. My daughter wanted to get just a taco & it was going to be around $10! I usually get mini chimis from other restaurants so I thought I would try theirs. The mini chimis I get at other places come with 8 mini chimis & a side of jalopeno cream cheese. There was only 4 mini chimis on the plate & the jalopeno cream cheese was inside the chimis & no side. They tasted ok but but we were very dissapointed & won't go back."
22361,0,Don't stay here. The room was in poor condition upon check-in. The restroom smelled like someone took a massive dump. The sheet was stained red which I am hoping is from cranberry juice. Somebody's used cotton ball was on the sofa bench. What really brought me over the edge was seeing melted ice in our ice bucket. Absolutely disgusting.
46530,1,Need to update their menu.
16012,1,"We met up in Vegas with cousins of ours whose son travels frequently to Vegas on business. He recommended this restaurant, which is a block away from the Fremont Street Experience (see my review of that as well). The steaks were huge but even so, it was a little pricey for being off the strip. The service was average and the d\u00e9cor wasn't anything special and pretty plain (all deep brown wood which might appeal to some). I had the petite New York, which wasn't very petite and my husband had the ribeye, which he claimed was \""good for a ribeye,\"" whatever that means. I usually douse my steak in A1 but it sat untouched throughout my meal. I left wishing we had tried a different steakhouse. Measly servings of wine as well, but you're still overcharged for a full glass. Other than that, nothing much to write home about for this one. Wouldn't go back if we came to Vegas again."
47400,0,"A coffee joint down the street recommended  this place. And since I love the coffee joint, I thought that this must be good. WRONG! We were right by the door, cashiers area & had the worst service! The food was blah!! I will NOT return."
1038,0,"I have to search long and hard for things in this store that don't expire the day I'm purchasing them. They don't have a lot of the things they offer in their weekly ad, which I try to plan my grocery list around. The lines are always SUPER long. The store is always dirty. I keep telling myself I'll go to another store but there isn't another one in the 'hood to go to, so I'll need to make a better plan to head further away for a better experience in another chain. I've tried to talk to assistant managers about my issues at the store and have been blown off or they act afraid and stutter a lot. \n\nThe only good news: The gentlemen that bag groceries and collect carts are VERY nice and helpful."
8836,4,I just want to give a HUGE thank you!!!! This place by far exceeded my expectations!!!! You guys are all so great and you truly do stay true to your words. I will definitely be coming here from now on. \nHands down the best place to go
38861,2,Pizza is pretty good but I expected more in atmosphere. The one on High St looks like it is decorated much more to match the creative names on the menu. This one kind of looks like a diner. \nGreat beer selection and amazing names of their dishes. No wait on a Sat night was a definite plus but I expected more.
36664,3,"Salt of the Earth opened back in September 2010, and like many other foodies in town, I had been waiting and waiting for the great day of revelation, but for various reasons, I didn't make it...until now. \n\nA friend of mine and I had been talking about getting to Salt for the better part of the past year--to celebrate a number of milestones that had passed, but finally we made it in mid-December in honor of our December birthdays (and all that other stuff). \n\nI knew well what to expect, and we chose to not make a reservation so that we could experience the communal tables on the first floor. The noise level was not terrible, but definitely would not be great for anyone with hearing troubles. The large menu was not that difficult to read, but I did like that they also had the URL up so you could choose to read it on your smartphone, should you be so equipped. I found the prices to be pretty reasonable for the level of dining -- entrees ranged from $15-24. Add starters ($6-13) and desserts ($7-8), and you can spend a pretty penny or a small fortune if you also imbibe a few of their cocktails, but we found ourselves quite pleased with our meals and the bill did not break the bank (we shared a salad and dessert and did not order any alcohol). \n\nI agree with other reviewers who note that you should be prepared for the experience and be in the mood for the atmosphere. I think that it would be best to have a small group (~4) if you are going to sit at the communal table, as I did feel a bit surrounded as a party of two smack in the middle of the table, but we were not too crowded and it was not too loud. \n\nThe service was functional and the wait staff were knowledgeable about the menu. We shared a beet, frisee, and egg salad drizzled with truffle oil ($10) that was fabulous and the portion was sufficient for two as a starter. The beets were chopped into small cubes and tossed with the truffle oil. Sweet frisee was piled on top with an egg laid on top of that. The runny yolk added to the richness of the dressing and it was truly divine. \n\nThere was a long wait between the salad and our entrees. We had been sitting for at least a half an hour with nothing on the table save a bottle of fizzy water (for which they get points for not charging some outrageous price) and I remarked that the wait was getting a bit ridiculous, even for a place that makes fabulous creations that should not be rushed. Our entrees thankfully showed up a few moments after that point, and they were fabulous. \n\nI ordered the seitan, a steal at $15. It was served with broccoli kim chi, wild rice porridge (which was poured along side the seitan) and ginger. Each bite had a slightly different combination of savory, tart, sweet, and bright. It was delicious, creative, nourishing and filling -- everything I want in a meal, and bonus points to Chef Souza for coming up with well-balanced and delicious veggie options. My dining companion had the scallops with mussels that were served with a sunchoke/potato puree, artichokes and olives. She also was very pleased with her meal.\n\nWe finished with the \""S'more\"" dessert, which was an insane (in all the good ways), combination of crumbled golden graham crackers, chunks of chocolate ganache, and heavenly elderflower-infused fluff, lightly torched for the \""melted over a campfire\"" effect. \n\nOverall, I'd give the food a 5; the service a 3.5 (servers were helpful, but the time between courses was long and we finally had to ask for our check after again sitting for a while after finishing our dessert); and the atmosphere a 3. It's a shwank looking place--beautiful, but a bit hard and lacking intimacy (I can't speak for the upstairs space). I will definitely be back, but I think you have to be in the mood for the experience. If you are in the least tired or looking for a comfortable, relaxed experience, long group tables and backless chairs in a cavernous room with a 15 ft chalkboard on one side and the open kitchen on the other will not deliver. If, however, you're up for a wonderful food adventure with a couple of energetic friends, NACL is just the place for the perfect evening."
25789,2,"If you're looking for a cheap night it's perfect. The movie and food combined will cost you under $5 and you'll get to see a slightly older movie.\n\nUnfortunately for me, being 6'2\"", I wasn't very comfortable. The seats are pretty tight and clearly not the same seats as in the regular overpriced theatres.\n\nI'd rather pay $10 for a movie, when I go maybe once every week or two, and get high quality sound, screen and comfortable seats."
47491,1,"You're kidding...this is worst deli and they call themselves a NY deli, not even close. I guess most of the people that ate there have never eaten at a real New York Deli, there are a few around here. \n\nI work in the building too and I would rather walk to Harris Teeter to get lunch then spend $10 on a sandwich there,at least at  Harris Teeter you can buy a whole 12 inch sandwich for less than $5, they have more meat  and fresher vegetables, and you can make your own salad for for less thanNY Deli charges.  \n\nSorry don't waste your money!"
26876,2,"Loved the carne, hated the seating arrangement. \n\nWe hit the Coronado location today for lunch and despite planning our meet for 11:30 to increase our chances of landing a table inside we were diverted to Patio City. Huge bummer.\n\nThe burrito was all kinds of delicious (and the portion is perfect, unlike the 'roided up burritos found at Qdoba, Chipotle and even Chico's) but sitting at a rock hard, scorching hot picnic table took a bit of the enjoyment away from the experience. \n\nI understand the converted house is tiny (and that's part of charm), but would investing in some misters downgrade the authenticity? I think not. \n\nAlso, I'm not against any Green initiatives, but delivering food baskets sans napkins is a bad move.\n\nI'll definitely go back for the carne, but probably not anytime before late October."
41938,3,"Jets is delicious. You will not find any pizza place in town that gives better pizza than Jets. As a frequent goer, I recommend the 8 corner pepperoni with cheese on the crust. Also, the barbecue chicken will not disappoint."
4471,1,We normally enjoy Red Robin and one of our favorite things is the fries. We had never been to this location but stopped for a quick lunch. The fries were terrible. They were mushy and we didn't even finish the side order that came with our burgers. We won't be visiting this location again.
19585,0,i would never ever recommend them to anyone ever! first lets start with i only had my braces for 7 months. i have seen them every single month and has a payment every single month. back in may when i had my rubberbands changed they told me i was a month behind come to find out they applied my payment to a general payment and i never had any general work done! they said its from xrays they took when i asked them before they started anything will need to repay for xrays because if so i can have my general dentist send over my xrays since i just paid to have some done a day prior to my braces consultation i was told no i dont have to pay its included in the free exam. i call today and they tell me im 285.00 bucks behind and they will not apply one of the payments i made to the ortho account because i was charged for xrays then told me that i have only paid 3 payments out of the 7 months i have had it and thats not true because had i not made those payments they would of damn sure made me pay them before i got any work done. corporate is rude and the office staff sucks. they can do what they want with that contract because i will be taking my business somewhere else and i will be also filing a complaint with the bbb right along with everyone else that has! straight fraud! and whats even worse! my brackets keep falling off! but they want to harass you for payments but cant fix your teeth right! a bunch of losers! dont go to western dental this is a warning they are a bunch of rude scame artists!
22436,2,"Despite the 2.5 rating on yelp, the food can be compared to a average home town buffet without the selection. Overall the food was okay and your better off going to the In-n-out down the street for a bomb ass juicy burger. In addition, there is the smoke from the nearby casino that permeates the buffet, so if your into that then this place is definitely your bet. Otherwise, I'll dine elsewhere."
2488,3,I read the bad reviews about the tailor but I have been there about 4 times and everything has looked good every time. I think the last 3 times I have just pinned the stuff myself so not sure about how anything he needs to pin works out. I just go because it's convenient but I just did pay $20 to have a dress hemmed. Not sure what they would charge elsewhere but I haven't had any problems so far so I keep going.
3466,0,"Great produce, good small appliance selection and terrible customer service.   We used to shop here weekly, but have stopped in the last couple of years because of the uniformly unfriendly folks at checkout.   Unfortunately, the final impression is always the most lasting.  While the employees in produce, meats and other departments are all really great, the checkers here make shopping a very unpleasant experience"
41550,2,First time visiting this location- my husband and i were able to be seated right away on a Friday night (granted it was 8pm) but I hate waiting! I thought the fried pickles were pretty tiny and wish that they were a little bit thicker (so it didn't just taste like breading). Chicken was typical Hooters chicken -nothing special for the price. The one thing that I will say was great is that they do have every NHL playoff game there.
49954,1,"Well we went and tried it and not my favorite. I've been to many places in Las Vegas for sushi and this one did not hit its mark. Two things high prices that are not justified and service was so so. Never brought our edamame we ordered and put it on the bill. Rolls were extremely generic. Fake caterpillar roll had no flavor along with sex on the beach which tasted like rice vinegar that overpowered the whole roll. Salmon sashimi was not cut correctly, it was cut like the crab sticks which detracted from its presentation and flavor. Burning sensation roll with soft shell crab, avo, and tuna was swimming in a garlic ponzu and for some reason here was a heaping mound of rice on my plate. Overall not impressed and won't be back. Many other sushi places to try in Vegas for better food and service."
35334,4,O boy I just discovered ROCKET BURGERS &SUBS. TOTALLY AWESOME!!!! This is the first time in a long while I drank 7-up from a bottle...tha fries are the bomb too!!!!!
28878,3,"Beautiful hotel retreat right on the Strip. Since there's no casino in here, it's nice to come back to a quiet hotel to pass out. Lobby is located on the 23rd floor and all the hotel rooms are 22nd floor and below (23 floor and up are private residences). The lobby area is pretty grand and it's definitely a really nice way to be welcomed into Vegas. \n\nService is good but there were a few details that were missed (like...forgetting to clean our room haha). I wouldn't say the service here is more spectacular than what you can get at other nice hotels but I'm just being snooty. Esp if you're going to pay a premium for staying here. \n\nThey do have a complimentary house car that will take you anywhere but check with downstairs since it never seems to be available. We only used it on our last day when we finally snagged a ride to the airport (actually, it wasn't available but we said we'd wait for it since we weren't in a rush). \n\nAlso key? There's a 24-hour CVS located right next door for all your late night munchies as well as a Starbucks right outside the hotel. Also, it's located right next to Aria & City Center so from a location stand point, it's pretty damn convenient."
16962,1,"Overview: \n--Overpriced, seasonly-challenged restaurant. Better value and food elsewhere on the strip.\n\nWhat I had:\n--bread basket\n--cesar salad\n--seafood platter\n--Filet mignon, medium\n--side of mashed potatoes and mac'n'cheese\n--Banana & chocolate cream pie\n\nThe Great:\n--bread was fantastic, especially the pretzel loaf and puffy muffins\n\nThe Good:\n--Banana & chocolate cream pie desert \n--Cesar salad but come on, how do you mess up iceberg, croutons, and dressing?\n\nThe Mediocre:\n--Unremarkable ambience. Honestly I can't even remember it.\n--Service was pretty darn slow. Yes, we had a table of 15 people but this is Vegas and that scenario is extremely common. Everything felt a half hour behind schedule.\n\nThe Bad:\n--seafood platter had 1) a pleasant large cold shrimp, 2) underwhelming pieces of cold crab meat, and 3) the blandest lobster tail I've ever had in my life -  no joke. It was utterly devoid of flavor. \n--the steak; properly cooked, tender meat, but criminally over salted. I'm talking \""tongue writhing with dehydration\"" salty. I THINK I could taste some steak under all the seasoning. Most everyone in my party agreed.\n\nSummary:\n--Don't be fooled by this \""high end\"" steakhouse. Just because they nonsensically have a number in their name and charge a pretty penny doesn't mean you're getting good food. In fact, I'd probably have enjoyed a meal at Outback more and payed a third of what I did here."
39069,1,"I'm only giving it 2 stars bc the food is good ad that's about all that's good about this place.\n\nPros: good, healthy food\n\nCons: service is ok, not terrible and it takes forever to get your food\n\nWell, the food is pretty good...if you don't mind waiting 30 minutes or longer for it. My bf and I are staying at the hotel and thought we would go down and get some breakfast to go. There was only one person in line ahead of us and they got a coffee and a pastry. I ordered the \""Skinny Scramble\"" which is literally scrambled eggs and veggies thrown in together. Nothing complicated. He got a bagel with bacon egg and cheese which he got right away. \n\nAfter 20 minutes of waiting we said something and I watched the lady pick up the phone and basically reorder my food. By this time his bagel was cold so we asked for a new one. The one they gave us seemed a bit greasy, but we didn't think much of it. I finally got my food and the lady was nice enough to give me a fruit cup for free (which here is $6). While we were waiting, there were also other people waiting forever for their food and they too had to go say something and then and only then did they get their food.\n\nSo...the bagel was so greasy it was literally falling apart. My scramble was amazing, but it definitely looked a little rushed. \n\nThis place is consistent in that, the food is really good, but it takes forever to get it. We actually went here last night and it took forever, again, to get our food and he got a grilled cheese and I got gnocchi (potatoes) with meat sauce. Again, nothing complicated, but apparently it is for these people.\n\nI will not be eating here again. I'm a pretty laid back person and I don't usually get this upset, but this place is just disappointing."
5334,0,"These guys are crooks. They could not have been less organized when bringing our goods into the convention hall. It was as if they let 50 guys out of prison and give them forklifts. No joke. The guys who were supposed to unload our truck got into a violent argument over their favorite classic rock bands, so we ended up unloading the truck. \n\nWeeks later I find out that it cost me $1.00 per pound to move my exhibit the 200 ft from the loading dock to my space. I can ship goods from Boston to California for $0.30 per pound. \n\nThis rate is a total joke. The terrible service is just insult to injury. Companies like this just can't last. I won't be going back to Expo East and that's about $25k in lost revenue. That's someones job. There is recourse for being a crook and treating people like garbage."
28154,4,"I loved this hotel. The rooms along with the lobby/dining area were all beautiful, comfortable, and perfectly maintained. It was the perfect mix of modern conveniences in a historic building and area. And don't get me started on the bed.  OMG - best sleep in I don't remember how long!   Also, loved my breakfast.  Very fresh and tasty.  Food prices extremely reasonable here!\n\nThis will be my home in Montreal when I return.  Heart Hotel Gault!!!"
34366,0,"I have to give this establishment a major FAIL tonight. Didn't wanna do it, but their completely amateurish, mindless faux pas tonight behind the bar forced me to do it.\n\nOkay, so...what bartender would toss out an almost-full champagne flute of high-end sparkling sake - wait for it - with a receipt covering the top of it (universal barspeak for \""do not touch\""!)??? Apparently \""Doug\"" would. So, I return from a quick trip to the restroom and find my receipts, water glass and champagne flute mostly full of my Zipang disposed of by the man who was just seconds earlier being so kind and accommodating.\n\nWell, something's very wrong with this picture, folks. And, did they apologize, when I expressed my dismay, saying \""That's why I put the receipt on top of the glass...it was an almost-full flute...\""? No. Just a \""get him another one\"" directive from the manager to good ol' Dougie...nothing from the barkeep in question like \""Oh, sorry, man. Thought you'd split and left most your drink, covered by your receipt\"" (Apparently a quite common occurrence in \""Doug World\"")...Nah, just an uncomfortable vibe due to their (his) glaringly poor bartending decision. I sipped my replacement drink and was treated as if I should have cleared out already - or was it the painful embarrassment of a ridiculous bartending mistake hovering over us at that point? I should think the latter. Both are uncomfortable and should be avoided at all costs.\n\nUh, bottom line (and covered in Bartending Basics 101), Stingray staff: Any object covering a mostly-full drink is probably an indicator from the patron that they are coming back, and wish to consume the rest of said drink."

39235,3,"Went there on a Wednesday around 9pm. Service wasn't that great. Water wasn't refilled in a timely manner and we were never asked how our meal was. The girl dropped one of the slices of bread from our salad onto the table and did not bring us a fresh slice. Our server wasn't rude exactly but I just got the vibe that she was bored and had no interest in being there. \n\nThe food is the reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars. The bruschetta was delicious, as was the house salad. The pizza was pretty good although I much prefer Piccolo Forno in Lawerenceville. Piccolo Forno has better pizza and service. \n\nOn a separate occasion we went for gelato. It's overpriced but it brought back memories from my semester in Italy so if was worth it."
39640,4,"My husband and I go here ever 10 days- 2 weeks depending on what services we need. I get gel polish with a manicure pretty frequently because cooking & bartending do a number on my nails! My husband gets pedicures for in-grown toenails & manicures since he needs his nails nice for his job.\nAnna does my nails and I like chatting with her while there. Her work is very neat and she always recommends great colors. Hubby has Holly do his toes and she or Cindy do his mani's. They are both super sweet! \nI have referred Cindy to my friends who get acrylics and they have been very happy with her work.\nTheir hours are great, service is great and work is super great!"

9270,3,"Big electronic billboards, shiny floors, and blinking lights. Not normally things that would seem appealing about an airport, but all things that get my attention.\n\nI fly in and out of here a few times a year and it's usually a good experience. Mad props for having the best taxi line I've ever seen at an airport with such high demand for them.  Yeah, the line is long.  No worries because it moves really quickly.\n\nActually, everything here seems to move quickly except the baggage handlers. I swear it takes half an hour for luggage to get from the plane to the terminal.  I usually don't check bags and it sucks when I do because there's nothing worse than seeing The Strip and not being able to be there.\n\nPS: Never play the slots here. You won't win. Seriously. I've never seen them do anything except take money. There's clearly a reason there isn't a cashier or ticket redemption machine in the terminal."
49562,0,"If you want your fluffy gorgeous comforter to come back looking like a dingy, lumpy mess then take it here! The sign out front just says \""CLEANERS\"" When bringing it in a guy clearly distracted by the soccer game was trying to get me out as quickly as he could so he could get back to watching.  When I showed him a stain I wanted removed he quickly brushed me off with \""sure, sure. Come tomorrow.\"" I should've grabbled my blanket & left right then.  \nThe next day a young girl asked what my blanket looked like & if it was any laying by the door, I said no.  I showed her my ticket & she then asked me to look through the stack of blankets (WTH) I saw it at the bottom & she then handed me shirts that were on top. I explained the shirts weren't mine & she just shrugged it off & put them back. Not cool.  Once I got home I noticed taking it out of the bag it felt MUCH thinner. I set it on the bed to examine & sure enough all the filling was bunched together, color was completely off, stitching was frayed, there were extra stains that weren't there to begin with & it was as flat as could be.  We called & the girl said we would have to call after the weekend to talk to the manager. My husband went in & spoke with the manager who said he just followed the directions on the tag (riiiight) & that there wasn't anything he could do.  My husband told him that he should at least refund us the money of the cleaning which he finally agreed to.  Never taking my things here again! I will continue to make the drive to my usual place."

41824,1,"The boss was heading to a diner today for a lunch meeting, and being already tired of my leftovers for the week, my mind starting thinking of diner Reubens, and I had a craving that had to be filled.\n\nI googled 'Reubens' and 'Strip District' and a few dining establishments that have vanished from the Strip District, but not from Google, popped up.  The one that was current was the brand new Car Hops, citing 'Reuben' on the menu.   So, since the Strip offerings really are limited when you work there, I decided to go for broke and fulfill the craving while trying out the new place on the block.\n\nI had heard a few 'meh' reports from co-workers who tried it once, but was really set on a Reuben.  So I went in, and found it on the menu (at $12.50) and pretty much indeed DID go for 'broke' for a lunch sandwich.  \n\nThe burly tattooed man behind the counter 'warned' me that it was huge, and I replied with a 'this is a test, we'll see.'\n\nWhen I travel to NYC, say for a long weekend, four out of my six meals will probably be Reubens, because it's the one place (seemingly) on the planet, where you can get a SUPERB Reuben anywhere they serve a Reuben.  I think it's NY law.  And I DO love a good Reuben.\n\nI placed the order and paid, and then waited about fifteen minutes, and the gal behind the counter brought it out to me in a styro container in a bag, and I walked it back to the office.  It had a good weight to it, and I was encouraged.\n\nI sat it down on my desk, pulled the styro container out of the bag, and popped it open.  It WAS huge...it filled the entire container, and it did look pretty darned good.\n\nBut then I sat down with my soda and a few paper towels and started eating it.\n\nBREAD!!!\n\nRye bread, that was very possibly more than a full inch thick - a kind of Texas Toast thickness...TONS of sauerkraut and thousand island sauce that made it squishy...but a little light on the meat and cheese.  \n\nMy co-workers had also commented on the bread being a bit too much and the contents being light in what they'd had...why I didn't listen...I don't know.\n\nHonestly kids...do NOT try to dupe me with a loaf of bread with no stuffing...I'm hip to the jive.  What was inside that loaf of bread was not worth the $12.50 price tag.\n\nThis was another FTLT visit.  \n\nAlthough, I must admit - while I waited for the sandwich to be made - someone at a table had ordered cheese fries, and they did look awfully good.  They were real potato fries, but they were smothered in that gooey orangey fakey cheese sauce, which to ME is what sinfully delicious cheese fries are supposed to be all about.\n\nI 'might' go back and try the cheese fries - at $3.75 for a healthy sized basket, that might be a worthy splurge lunch.  \n\nBut I won't be going back for a Reuben - or any other loaf-o-bread sandwich.  \n\nYou don't eat a Reuben for the rye bread.  It's all about the meat and cheese - with the sauerkraut and thousand island dressing being VERY secondary, only there for flavor.\n\nAnd that goes for any other sandwich - it's all about the filling - not the wrapper."
749,4,"This is my favorite NPR affiliated station....EVER. \n\nI know. Charlotte Talks can be smug. I hate People's Pharmacy. My God- what is Says You?? However, the rest of the programming is top of the line stuff. You might think this is normal. Go on a road trip and listen to other stations. They play too much Jazz. They have NO local programming (as much as I complain about Mike Collins being smug- it is excellent to have a local program like it and I'm starting to not mind it)\n\nKeep doing what you are doing because you make me so happy on my way to work and on my way home. I also listen to you on the weekends. I have been a sucker for NPR since I was a little girl. I know a good stations and this is one of them. \n\nThis is starting to sound like an awkward love letter.\n\nI don't even mind the fundraising. You have to make money somehow.

8703,3,"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant for Valentine's day. We had reservations, and were made to sit in a not-so-private table (thats why the four stars). The bread (some kind of white bread with sesame seed crust) was warm, fresh and tasty. The spinach soup with egg white and chicken broth was comfort food, and tasty. We had the Chianti on their menu, which went very well with the Veal Marsala. The marsala was very very well done--kudos to them, and the portion size was just right. I forget what the name of the dish (veal dish) that my boyfriend had but that was also amazing. We finished our dinner with a chocolate torte with pear and connoli--yumm!! The two of us are very impressed with the food and we will almost certainly go back soon."

EVERYBODY on staff was on point. Hostess, server, busser and food runners were exceptionally efficient and smiled, making myself and company feel like they actually gave a damn we were there. My server rattled off 15 salad dressings without even looking up.... Impressive.  Not a dish, glass or dirty napkin sat on the table for longer than 30 seconds!!  The food was well prepared and was delivered not too quick, not too late... Perfect.  Beer was flowing and tasted amazing as usual.  Our glasses, weather water or beer, never reached empty.  Over all, a great dining experience with nothing to complain about (unfortunately something I haven't had in a long time).  Can't wait to go back!!!"
38533,3,"Service was great, thin crust pizza awesome and good red wine for $8 per glass.  One pizza feeds one person for 13-20 cost range plus drinks and a salad or appetizer.  The creamy mozzarella plus pesto was excellent and enough for two to share for $11.  Food quality, service and atmosphere are far superior than a Pizza Hut or typical pizza place and yes you pay more!  I would recommend to them a kids pricing menu with games for $5 range and a family feeds four couple of pizzas and salads and appetizers for around $40.\n\nWayne Gorsek"

3707,1,"I must say I was rather disappointed when I called to try and do a tasting for my daughter's party that was needing a cake for at least 50 people. The lady on the phone said that they did not do tastings for cakes that were for 50 people and that they were booked for six weeks out anyway. \n\nMy husband and I used them for our weeding nine years ago and were quite please with the quality of the cake and with the service, but it seems like they no longer care, nor would they have received our business nine years ago since our wedding only was for 50 people. Needless to say, we ended up having to go with another cake place that didn't care if we were serving eight people or 1,000. Customer service is a must now a days! Two stars is for what I remember of their yummy cakes."
46889,4,"I utilized De Atley Events & Design to plan and execute my destination wedding.  No detail was left undone and we simply had the most wonderful experience a bride and groom could hope for.  The proprietor, Shannon De Atley, did a fabulous job incorporating our personalities into the ceremony and reception while making sure that all of the vendors were managed, pricing was negotiated to reasonable levels and our guests all commented that it was the most fun they had ever had at a wedding.  The little touches that I never would have thought of on my own were what really made things so special.  If or when I need to hire an organization for any event, I would definitely use De Atley Events & Design and recommend them to anyone looking for a top notch professional who also knows how to make sure everyone has a fun experience!"
22273,1,"I want to like Icon.  I've dined here 4-5 times over the years and I keep coming back because I think that it must be improving because it stays open, but I'm now convinced that it exists solely based upon its proximity to the Overture Center.\n\nThe food is average.  The service is average at best.  They do have a decent wine selection at a fairly moderate price point.  That may be the high point, along with a decent cocktail menu.\n\nThe tapas menu is inventive, but not well-executed.  \n\nLast evening, the patatas bravas were overcooked and the sauce was very uninspired.  \n\nThe crab cake was too much breading and not enough crab--and only one crab cake for $12 does not seem like a good value.  \n\nThe stuffed piquillo peppers were served too cold, and the cous cous accompanying them was bland and flavorless.  It had clearly been microwaved, too, instead of reheated properly.   \n\nLastly, the short rib served with manchego mashed potatoes sounded divine, but it was stringy and not a good cut of meat.  The potatoes were fine, but very light on manchego.  The sauce was the highlight, but Icon's kitchen was not very generous with it.  \n\nTwo diners left disappointed, not full at all, after four tapas and one drink each for $86.  \n\nIcon:  neither a good meal nor a good deal."
45647,1,"This theater is so dang busy. I understand it is in the middle of Town Square and all, but it has a vibe to it that makes me feel unwelcome. It really isn't for locals unless absolutely convenient or necessary. The seats are nice and the prices are high. Except for the $5 Tues movies."
4862,1,"Another quick lunch led me to this place. I headed straight to the drive-thru and ordered their lunch special: 4 tacos, a drink, and fries for $4.99. They get points for being quick (only waited about 5 minutes) and friendly. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing about this place. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos. The tortillas were thick and gummy. The asada was dry and had little flavor. The al pastor was excessively greasy and the fries were forgettable. This might be good drunk food at 4 in the morning, but when you're sober... not so much."

I thought something was up too when we were there on a Saturday afternoon over Memorial weekend and the place was pretty much dead.\n\nThe artichoke/spinach dip was pathetic, and actually tasted like they put a lot of pepper (ew!) into it, and the chips were stale. I asked for a medium rare steak, and it came out damn near mooing and running around the plate as well as smelled funny (my son ate most of his as we split the plate before I got to mine so I couldn't send it back). I will say that the ribs were good though. Food quality was NOT worth the price I paid for the food. I paid $2.99 for a LEMONADE! UGH! Lunch for 2 - about $50 out the door tip included.\n\nWe got seated next to the large fountain, which at first I though was cool, and then I realized that my son and I could not have a conversation, and I was getting damp from the mist. It is sooooo louuuuddddd in there!

I have been fortunate to have the correct mixture combination for each of order except for once which I had them remake\n....... Tropical smoothie cafe offers a text service where they will text you coupon and the coupons, about once a week at least sometimes more for some pretty good deals. Sometimes the free food with the purchase sometimes half off on your drink sometimes buy one and get one free.\n....... Too many smoothies?... Live alone only based one drink.  I have good tip for you.   You need a freezer and a blender. I have found I put my second smoothie in the freezer I've left it there from  days up to a weeks. When I am ready for it I take it out let it semi-thaw.  Once its soft on outer perimeter but a little more stiffer on the center core I put it in the blender run the blender and BAM JUST LIKE NEW!!!"
23447,4,"I give these guys major props for having vegan gelato that actually tastes really good. I knew about this place before, but didn't check it out until I purchased a deal on living social. And I am so glad I did! \n\nWent in for the first time last week. They had two flavors of vegan gelato, six flavors of sorbet (which is also non dairy) and I think they had one or two flavors of vegan soft serve, among other dairy based flavors of gelato and soft serve. I opted for both flavors of the vegan gelato. The guy working the counter was really nice. He told us they rotate the flavors about once a month, so they always have something different. The flavors I got this day were pistachio and amaretto chocolate. Both were really good. And I have had REAL gelato before. Like the kind in Italy. And these were just as good. I wont say better because nothing beats Italian gelato, but these were definitely the best vegan gelato I have ever had. I went back a couple of days later and they had a third flavor of gelato out, spicy chocolate. It was definitely spicy. There is no way I could ever eat an entire cup of it. But it was good for a couple bites. I am excited to go back in a few weeks to see what new flavors they have."

But for the amount you get, it's really over priced.   Over prices and pretentious.  It's also not too fun being handed a binder for a menu but being told you can only order from the back cover of 5 or 6 options.  The meal sizes are appetizer size at best.  I left feeling so hungry and unsatisfied after spending $15 for the \""pizza\"".

7616,1,"It's shameful how \""downhill\"" this place has gone.  I used to be a huge fan when the Sirrine's owned it.  I'll stick to Rancho de Tia Rosa (which IS owned by the Sirrine's) next time.  \n\nThe service was PAINFULLY slow.   Now, I could understand that years ago when I used to go and it took 45 minutes to an hour just to get a table.  But when only 4 or 5 tables are filled there's NO EXCUSE for poor service.  \n\nThe salsas used to be SO MUCH BETTER and more flavorful.  They are a hint of their former selves.  The salsa verde - previously a stand-out in the green salsa category - is mediocre at best... and that's a tremendous compliment.  Oddly enough -the chips are still some of the best I've ever, ever, ever had.  \n\nThe food - like the salsas - is a shadow of its former self.  It lacks the succulence, the flavor, and the wow-factor it had when Dennis Sirrine was calling the shots.  It's bland, slightly dry and just not there anymore.  What was equally disappointing is they've replaced their iced tea (something used to drive across town for) to a horrible concentrate.  Blech.  \n\nConsidering this place used to be packed to the gills on a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm and now you can easily walk in on Friday at dinner time and have your pick of tables, the restaurant needs to recognize the issue and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  They absolutely cannot go on like this."
4851,1,"I ordered the \""grilled\"" mahi-mahi plate and ended up receiving a mahi-mahi omelette. I politely went to the counter to clarify my order, but the employee, a young kid, claimed the mahi-mahi plate is cooked with egg. If that is the case, then the menu should clearly state that. Not grilled. I didn't want to argue simply because I was wary of having something done to my reorder, didn't want to waste food, and was already starving. On top of that, the mahi-mahi omelettes were extremely bland (along with the side of mac salad) that I needed to add a lot of Aloha soy sauce which was probably the only best thing about my meal."
22637,2,"I don't like the pizza, pasta, or stromboli here one bit (after multiple attempts).  You can do way better elsewhere (try Rocco's just across the 215) for actual food that is Mark Rich's namesake.\n\nBut the tuna melt and french fries here are absolutely fantastic.  I think they use provolone cheese and it makes for a great sandwich, if a little greasy.  The Greek-style pita and mozzarella sticks are pretty decent as well.  \n\nOtherwise, this place has a nice, family-run, slightly upscale feel to it (e.g. it's more of a sitdown restaurant than a fast-food place).  Service is friendly and prompt enough.  Too bad about the pizza, but if you are craving a tuna melt, Mark Rich has got you covered."

Both young men standing at the host stand had their backs to the door and I had to make myself known.  The restaurant is loud, just from the hum of business.  I then saw a gentleman with balloons strung around his waist making balloon creations.  You know what else carries balloons?  Clowns.  I hate clowns.  And while trying to enjoy my dinner, balloon squeaks and eventual pops was really not what I was looking forward to as a way to end my work week.  Tables that were sat after me got wait service before I did.  I was regretting my decision to not just head to the Ballantyne location.  Because of the lack of crumb snatchers in the restaurant, the balloon dude then made some for the stagnant wait staff. But the food would be great, right?  Yeah!\n\nThe food:\nMozzarella sticks ($6.95):  6 small sticks served with marinara.  Thick coating on the sticks that tasted a little bland, but you don't want to overpower the cheese.  Marinara was tasty.  Not worth $7, but fine.\n9\"" white pizza ($9):  I love white pizza and it is usually really good or really bad - this was good.  It hit the table smoking hot, cut into 4 pieces on a small pizza pan with a pizza serving spatula.  The crust was thin and crispy.  \nDiet Coke to drink (yay Coke products) and it was kept full by my quiet waiter.  \n\nI was too full for dessert, but it looked like there were some good choices.  I watch Hawthorne's Facebook page and they do a lot of work with the community and with kids eating free on Tuesdays and a balloon guy, they are definitely family friendly.  LOTS of people came in and out with takeout orders, so it stayed steady for business.  \n\nThe food was a 4, the overall experience was a 3 though - I'll continue to support Hawthorne's and their great pizza at the Ballantyne location."

29368,0,I was super excited to see that there was a Serendiptiy in Vegas. This was my first stop before hitting the roulette table. I quickly ordered the 12oz frozen hot chocolate for $10 bucks and what I got tasted like a.......\n\nMOCHA FRAPPUCCINO\n\nWTF???\n\nthis place is totally hyped... I should have gone to starbucks to save time and money!
8379,4,"Yes, this is a car dealership, however, to make a long story short I needed a car.\nI've had a Volvo in the past and thoroughly loved it.\nI was totally freaked out about having to go car shopping for the first time without a guy there who knows more about this stuff.  Being a woman I figured they would totally take advantage of me. I knew what I wanted to put down and I knew what I wanted my payments to be.  I don't remember who the sales manager was (I'm sure it's on my paperwork).  Anyway, I fell in love with a gorgeous 2011 C70 which was in my price range.\nVolvo of Tempe made it work.  It was totally painless and I was on cloud 9 for weeks.\nI still love my car  and I still think of Volvo of Tempe often and how amazing they are.\nI'd recommend them to everyone."
4978,0,"After all the great reviews my husband and I decided to give it a go.... wah wah wah. Hubby ordered chicken fried steak and banana bread. He said the bread was awesome, and that the chicken fried steak was o.k and that Big Dogs is better. I ordered the American Cheeseburger ( i know i ordered a cheeseburger in a breakfast joint ) but I was still thinking its a family owned diner it should be good. BIG Mistake..it was hands down the worst cheeseburger I have had in my life! The meat tasted like it was old and from one of those tubes that you buy for 2 bucks at the store. It was burned on the outside and pink in the middle, over worked dry and tough, the bun was wet from the wilted veggies. It actually made me sick ( i only are 2 bites )The atmosphere is unclean and it smells like dirty grandmas. I dont know how it got so many rave reviews... I guess people have no taste buds! And to top it off it was 35 dollars ( with my daughters 1 pancake included ). Stay away unless you like being sick and paying for it."
14235,0,"When I first walked into Tryst and waited at what was likely an Elf's table for 45 minutes without any drinks, I started to seriously second guess my attractiveness. We were a group of 14 ladies 23-24 years old in Vegas for a Bachelorette party who had reserved bottle service this past Saturday. We all had on suggestive, expensive dresses and I am 100% sure all my friend's are highly attractive. At other clubs we had used this to our advantage by not waiting lines, demanding strangers buy us drinks, etc, so I was SHOCKED at the response we got from the staff at Tryst. They treated us like half of the girls were missing limbs and the rest were missing all their teeth and hair. I soberly waited 45 minutes to be led off into a wooded area where I was sure they were going to make us dig our own graves and then shoot us in the back and bury us-this is how deserted the area was. Although conveniently they placed us next to a dumpster so we could freely throw away any garbage that might have collected around us. I thought maybe they were going to offer us janitorial jobs or something for the evening. We waited about another 45 minutes to receive our mixers. I was simply bored out of my mind at this point, so I went to go meet some strangers. Luckily the guys we had met at the Palm's pool had reserved a table THAT DAY (we reserved our's over a month ago)...and they had their table in the main area, not in Switzerland where we were located. So I happily waltzed over with them and drank their alcohol. I also happily wore my four inch stiletto heels and jumped on your couches, I also freely poured cranberry juice on every surface available. I actually started to have some fun for the evening. I continued to destroy everything in my way that night, dropping bottles on the ground, dumping the ice buckets on the couches, so I think I got my $1800 worth. I also got this awesome bedazzled Tryst hat that if I openly wore in Seattle I hope someone would voluntarily shoot me and put me out of my misery. So thank you Tryst, for completely ruining my second night in Vegas!"
41393,3,"Authentic Mexican cuisine. Pretty good flavors. The pork al pastor leaves something to be desired. The salsa options are a huge plus.\n\nClean place.\n\nFriendly staff.\n\nCheap and fast.\n\nCertainly one of the best restaurants in Urbana, for whatever that's worth."
46403,4,I work down the road and love stopping in for a quick bite to eat. Always friendly and great customer service.  They give a 20 % discount to veterans!!
35060,4,We first came here to the emergency room for my wife.  Today she had an outpatient surgical procedure.  We are very pleased with this hospital.  The staff is excellent and caring.  We are glad to have such a good facility close to home
21146,3,It's Target so I love it but I like the one off Flamingo and 215 better. The return desk is kinds awkward and the woman behind it gave me a hard time about missing a coupon when I walked RIGHT over. I like Travis at this location though. He's a good guy
41020,1,"I'm an Italian-American from the NJ/NY area. Sorry, North doesn't do it for me. Some of the flavor ideas/combinations to me are a little bizarre and don't work. The ricotta gnocchi with short rib and horseradish crema to me was like eating a steak sandwich, rather than a pasta dish.  I just wasn't a fan of the flavors-well, the horseradish crema-which was the ONLY flavor in the dish. And as another reviewer pointed out, the pasta did have some oil (or butter?) visibly separating, which was a little unappetizing. My husband had the \""house specialty,\"" the pasta bolognese, which also wasn't so good. Limp pasta and sausage-heavy bolognese. -No depth of flavor, one note.  Sorry, fresh, delicious pasta dishes shouldn't be that hard to achieve for an Italian restaurant.  Fox Concepts' Olive and Ivy is much better!!!  It's consistently great. I also happened to have a yummy pasta dish at Fox Concepts' Arrogant Butcher - it was a sweet potato pasta dish. When combined with some of my husband's steak, that was pretty delicious. Without the meat for some savoriness, it was a bit sweet."
32280,0,"This is a poorly run business with shoddy service at best, run by a guy with only the most basic understanding of how he should treat people.  I played several nights there as a musician, during which my friends and guests were treated to slow bar service, misrepresented prices, and inflated bills.  Did I mention that at the end of the night, I didn't get paid what I asked?\n\nI'd stay away from this place - there's a myriad of better options nearby with Gin Mill, Tavern on the Tracks, and Tyber Creek."
10199,2,"So we are HGVC time share owners and we have stayed at all of the Vegas properties. I would say that as far as the properties themselves, this would rank in the middle between the Flamingo and he one on the strip. The strip being the best of them all. \n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a very nice property and relatively new. The staff is very nice and friendly. The biggest plus for us with these properties is the fact that we have a kitchen. We have an infant and boy does the fact that you can just warm up water when you want to warm the milk bottle just make your life easier. \n\nI guess you can get similar amenities at other suite type residence but I have always been pretty happy with the Hilton HGVC. I would recommend this place for families but not for bachelor or bachelorette parties. This is a family oriented hotel. Not really meant for single. Remember, there is no casino on the property. There is the Hilton Las Vegas within walking distance.. maybe 1/2 block away.. \n\nOverall, I like this place.."
27279,2,"It was a fun experience, however make sure you book a reservation 24 hours in advance if you are using a Groupon or coupon, because the female staff get very snappy and condescending if you do not. We called ahead and asked if it was fine to use our Groupon even though we had not made reservations, and the girl who answered the phone said it was fine. Apparently, she did not run that by the rest of the staff because they pretty much made us feel like we had broken a cardinal rule when we arrived. \n\nBesides the inhospitable front desk staff, the bartender was awesomely entertaining and the rest of the experience was positive. Probably will not go back again, unless I have visitors from out of town, but it's worth at least one visit if you have not already been."
9337,4,"I absolutely LOVE Southwest Airlines. Many of you already know about the 2 free bags, low prices, and great service. Something however that shocked me was when I needed to cancel my flight, they made it such hassle free. All I remember was before with AA that I went through such loop holes to try to cancel a flight and they charged me fees on top of overprices tickets. But with Southwest, I was able to call the night before to cancel my flight and they send me a confirmation right away. I just used those credits to rebook another flight and I got the low prices offered on the site and there was no charge to rebook. Excellent service and motto. I will always fly southwest if I can!"
13209,2,"Nice hotel. Rooms were clean, but wished the maid would have changed out the sheets (also found a pill on the floor - brought our 4year old, so finding a pill on the floor was a little alarming to say the least). Hallways were littered with dishes and q-tips. Pool area was nice, but crowed, trying to find chairs difficult , unless you wanted to pay $50 for a \""reserved\"" chair. For $50 you should get an umbrella (no that's an additional $75).Granted I'm here during the summer, but we are here during the middle of the week. The casino and lobby are were very nice. The absolute worse thing was the-freaking elevators!!!!!! You can make it to the top of the empire state building quicker then you could get an elevator. Catching a cab was always quick and easy. Over all had a nice stay, just had bigger expectations and was let down a little bit,"
13949,2,"A mixed bag.\n\nService: Very good to great, 4 or 5 stars out of 5.\nFood: Inconsistent: 2 stars out of 5\nValue: Poor: 1 stars out of 5\nOverall: 2.5 stars out of 5\n\nDinner with spouse on October 8th.  \n\nService:\nGreeted by a knowledgeable waiter.  Cocktail prepared exactly to custom order.  The server knew the menu well, did a little bit of an upsell - not too hard.  Dishes were prepared as expected, and were served without delay.  Excellent work by the waiters and bussers.\n\nFood:\n(1) Scampi (Langostines) were not prepped well.  Claws were not cracked, neither were the legs.  Lobster crackers were not provided - Left about 40% of best meat in the shell.  Poor thinking on behalf of the head chef and poor value.  Tail was tasty.\n\n(2) Lasagnette con rag\u00f9 di crostacei was delicious, however the pasta was a little overdone.  Seasoning and taste were very good.\n\n(3) Tagliatelle con porcini was average at best.  Pasta (again) was a bit overdone and did not look or feel house-made.  Porcini tasted odd - I suspect previously frozen or otherwise preserved.\n\n(4) Veal chop was great.  Cooked to right (medium) doneness, Well seasoned, delicious.  Spinach was done right, and the cauliflower puree was tasty and the right texture.  \n\nOverall, \n- great service;\n- decent (not great) food,\n- so-so value, mainly because food fell short of the promise.\nWill give them another whirl tomorrow."
10125,1,"This hotel needs to be completely remodeled!! The elevator door hesitates to open on the second floor, The first time my wife and I were in the elevator we thought we were going to be stuck! The light timer for the bathroom need to be reset so that it stays on longer or just replaced with a regular switch, Both my wife and I had the lights go out while still in the shower and had to ask my spouse to open the door to get the timer to come back on! My wife usually packs shampoo and cream rinse that she has confiscated from our stays at other hotels but not this time because we were staying at a Best Western, Well we ended up down at the front desk to get the essentials for taking a shower. I guess people don't take showers in Las Vegas! Wi-Fi in this hotel means Were the F#$% did it go!! Had a exultant signal strength when I got to the room and in less than five minutes later I got a message saying that there were too many subscribers and that the Wi-Fi was not available, Never did use it while staying there."

46753,4,Been going to Deb for 13 years. She's the best (and funniest) manicurist in town. I love her and wouldn't go anywhere else!! I highly recommend her - and she's great at both blingy nails and the plain nails I usually like.
43386,1,"Disapointed for breakfast. Pricey for the quality-there's much better breakfasts in this town.  THere were good things and bad things: \nGOOD:  1. Very well executed eggs benedict, with spinach.  Very subtle and elegant. Potatoes were perfectly salty and nicely crispy. \n2.  Pain perdu was wonderful with accompanying compote of cranberry which was not too sweet.  The creme fresche too.  \n3.  Great setting and decor.\n4.  Friendly service, if a bit lazy. Manager did not seem warm and welcoming. \nBAD: \n1.   Green tea was badly executed.  Maybe 3-4 grams for 400ML.  Temperature about 190.  That is terrible, and tasted terrible.  It was prepared with a paper tea bag-most tea drinkers know that paper tea bags leave residual bad flavors, and this one did.  Green tea is supposed to be executed between 150-180.  3-4 grams should be about 120-180ml. \nWaiter insisted that the second green tea was called \""crocetia\"" a Japanese tea.  I told him that I didn't believe there was any such Japanese tea, and asked him to bring the bag over.  He refused at first, and insisted that it was indeed Crocetia.  He  later did bring the bag.  It was not crocetia but kokeicha.  I didn't know if it was \""formed\"" tea or \""twig\"" tea, so I decided not to order since I was getting a pretty typical Quebec \""I don't know and I'm not going ot find out experience\"".  The genmai cha was week, tasted bad and smelled funny.  The manager had to be told to take it off the bill despite my telling him the tea was bad.  Also a typical Quebec experience. \n2.  The smoked salmon was supposedly made by an artisinal smoked salmon maker.  They need to find a better one.  Lemeac has much better salmon with real character.  Lawrence as well.  Both make their own.  This is a high end place and this salmon tasted almost as though they were trying to replicate a salmon that people who frequent ordinary delicatessens in New York might like.  It's color and texture were disapointing.  there wasnt' the firm waxy smoothness or the smokiness of a good Scottish or Norwegian style salmon.  It tasted like cheap deli nova which in NY mostly comes from the same provider.  It is too soft, a strange color and lacks firmness, smokiness and good flavoring. \n3.  Presentation-great except for a pooling of grease on our plate under the potatoes. \n4.  Didn't offer additional coffee-had to ask for my wife who had said, \""maybe they charge for additional coffee\"".  \n5.  No bread provided-perhaps you have to order it and pay for it.  \n6.  Prices were high and the product was not as good as other less pricey restaurants for breakfast.\n7.  Manager had to be asked to take the tea off the bill-seemd a little testy about that.  Should have offered when I cgave him my comments.  Did not.  That is unacceptable in a restaurant like this.  \n8.  Bagel was hard and dry. \n9.  Cream cheese was nothign special.  Tasted almost like store bought Philadelphia brand, though it was grainier.  \n\nI think maybe Daniel has too many restaurants.  Ramsay has the same problem. If you come to Montreal, you better make sure your staff is not carrying around a lot of Montreal service habits."
49700,0,"Would give no stars based upon the service we received.  It was absolutely the worst service I've had.  Ignored, had to ask for service at bar after very long wait.  Ordered wine, appetizers, and entrees.  All food came at once.  What good restaurant does that?  Food not hot.  No wine, had to ask for it after food arrived.  Asked for salt and never brought it.  No return to see if food was OK or needed anything.  Very very disappointing for a brand new place with what should be good food and atmosphere.  Food was poorly tarnished by the service.  Such a shame."
49797,3,"Greeted and sat right away! Served hot sliced bread w/ olive oil heated in a panini press - good! Service good! No recommendations or anything, was offered dessert. I had the herb crusted / kale salad very good! \nI think would be a great evening place for an Italian date night!"
30331,1,"I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long."
23907,2,"I was not happy with this restaurant.  The atmosphere is nice, so I had high hopes when walking inside but...\n\nThe food is average and very overpriced, in my opinion.  And the wait staff was slow.  I will absolutely give them credit for acknowledging that the service was not acceptable: they removed $5.00 from the bill of $35.00, but frankly, there is nothing that would compel me to return to this restaurant."
11934,4,"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  It's always a great place to take folks who don't get to Vegas very often and don't know where to venture out to eat outside of their hotel.  \n\nThe Burger Bar has something for everybody.  They have a list of menu items they've put together as well as a create your own burger side.  Basically, you pick your bun, burger, cheese, vegetables, other toppings, and fries.  They have all kids of cheese, three or four types of bacon, many veggies, several types of onion, and even some uncommon items such as fois gras.  They have steak fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, seasoned fries, and zucchini fries.  You can pile it as high as you want.  The burgers are big and as delicious as you want to make them.  \n\nThey even have a few dessert burgers where a doughnut serves as the bun.  Originally, they only had one and it wasn't anything great to me.  Since then, they have added a few more options that I have yet to try.  Their milkshakes are delish as well.\n\nI usually make my own burger, but last time I ordered the sliders and they were very good.  It was a perfect choice when you're not hungry enough for a big burger.  The sliders are three mini burgers that are each different.  I'll definitely order that again.\n\nTime and time again, this is a great place and always has something for everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike.  I'm not sure about the vegan folks though...  They do get super busy and I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Roll up your sleeves, head to the Burger Bar and see who can build a better burger!"
48300,4,I come here at least 2 times a week after work. The atmosphere is so unique. The bargirls dress up like zombies. The owners are cool. Service is prompt. The whole zombie theme is cool. Even the alcoholic drinks are zombie themed. The location is convenient in Spring Valley just 1 mile from the Strip just past the Chinatown mall. \n\nAs for the food - I eat the zombolie and it's delicious. They get their dough from Boston fresh daily and it shows. Much better pizza products here then the cardboard tasting junk you get at chain restaurants.\n\nIf you are a visitor or local and want to check out a unique bar with a cool theme and no tourist prices I highly recommend!
46014,0,"We will never, ever be back.  We even talked with the GM about the service and he seemed to not care one bit about how we were treated or the service that was given.  We waited an entire hour to get our food and then it was cold.  We did send it back and it came back just warm.  The GM said that they were just way to busy tonight even though we saw others being served and finished even before we received our food.  The waitress was even worse, if that is possible.  Do yourself a favor, stay away!!!  \n\nIf I owned the bar, I would fire the GM first thing in the am.  As for how horrible the waitress was, I would also blame the GM for that as well.  Totally unacceptable.  \n\n\nStay away!"

28238,3,"So I found myself once again in Sun City West tonight this time to enjoy dinner with the in-laws. I have determined that if you enter the realm of Sun City, SCW, or SC Grand you are less likely to be stared and glared at if you are accompanied by a SC resident. Keep this in mind when you enter the Twilight Zone.\n\nBut the point of this review isn't to give tips on how to best deal with SC, but to tell you about a great little family restaurant called Rosie's Italian Cafe. Rosie's is nestled in Sun City West off of Meeker (also known as Reems outside of SCW) and Camino Del Sol near the True Value Hardware store. It is a cute place that recently added on another dining room when they took over the old Dominos pizza location that moved out of that strip mall. This turned out to be a good thing for Rosie's because before Dominos moved, Rosie's only served pastas, salads, and sandwiches--and NOT pizza. Which in and of itself is rather strange for an Italian restaurant. It seemed to work for them because for the most part, Rosie's has a pretty good, steady business. But, since Dominos moved out, Rosie bought their pizza ovens and voila, now Rosie's serves delicious, hot, fresh Chicago style pizza now.\n\nRosie's is moderately decorated with pretty floral plastic tablecloths and photographs of Chicago along with Chicago memoribilia. Nothing fancy or over the top and that's actually refreshing to not have a restaurant over do it. \n\nBack to that pizza....and let me just tell you, that pizza is thin crust, flavorful, mouthwatering gold my friends served straight from the ovens to your table with a wink and a smile from Rosie herself. \n\nRosie's has a great selection of pizzas but if that's not your thing, they also have a fantastic selection of pasta dishes and a Chicken Parm dinner that is simply to die for. There are also hot and cold sandwiches, light appetizers, salads, and soups on the menu as well.  The garlic bread served with the pasta dinners is hot, but melts in your mouth from this great garlic butter sauce that they smear on it. Oy...it is so good. The salads are fresh and not wilty with a great selection of dressings.  There is a soup of the day selection so the soup variation isn't too great, but that's ok because the one soup they are serving is made fresh that day. \n\nRosie's had a very good, steady flow of business tonight, a Wednesday evening, and when we left, there was actually a wait list for people to get in. Rosie's also does a steady take-out business as well.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a solid family restaurant that is no frills in the West Valley, Rosie's is your place. Blue Haired chaperone not required, but definitely recommended!"
36137,3,"We went here on the recommendation of the two other reviews on Yelp, and were pleased. The place is very small, but perfectly decorated. The staff are friendly and communicative. \n\nMy friends all loved what they had, but I wasn't so keen on the baked cod; it was rather flavorless. One friend had the figs for a starter and she loved them. Another had lasagna, and said that it was the best lasagna she's ever had in her life. \n\nI'd say that this place is worth the trip. Plus, they got very high ratings on another website that it used a lot in the UK."
15082,0,"There is no atmosphere, none, zip so don't come here if you're looking for a nice sit down Korean restaurant. It's a straight up cafeteria. You order your food at the front and then find a seat. They call your number and if you ordered two things, they will confusingly call the same number at different times depending on which dish is ready first. Also, it's very loud so they are basically yelling your number from the back. It seemed like a lot of Korean students were in here and I don't know why because the food was not very good. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing. I'm Korean and I've had decent Korean food before...but not from this place. Plus, I came with my baby in a car seat and this is not a place to bring a baby because there are no accommodations for one. And it's not that cheap. The food is normally priced if you ask me, roughly $10/plate. But hey, if you're looking for a cafeteria that serves okay-ish blahhh Korean food, then by all means, enjoy."
31863,0,"I am not buying into the hype. This place was dumpy with snotty airheaded old bartenders who will snub the shit out of you if you are a girl. She \""forgot\"" about my drink for 15 minutes until I pointed it out to the other bartender. Then the original bartender magically remembered. $20 for two shitty drinks and atrocious service. The manager was more interested in groping the bartender when he was behind the bar than actually checking in with patrons. Other than that, it is a standard dark, dumpy bar with a decent selection of beer. There are six TVs playing sports, 80s music blasting, and a pool table. I think they played Juke Box Hero like 5 times.  \n\nVideo poker at bar. Smoking allowed. Weak drinks. Crowd is pretty old. Very meh ..not much separating from chains like yard house. Except at Yardhouse you aren't treated like shit. Also, the idiot airhead bartender added extra $2 to her tip to make it 20% which I am disputing with the bank. It isn't about $2.00 it's about the entitlement these idiots feel even when they provide below sub par service."
38643,0,"...poorly trained stuff... took 40 minutes to get drinks, an hour to get breakfast... good luck trying it..."
44653,0,"First, the service was terrible; slow and cold. The food was sort of okay. Then I noticed the wine I was drinking was opened by pulling the cork through the foil without removing the metal around the mouth of the bottle. Every time the wine was poured, it flowed through the leaves of metal foil on the way to the glass. This is tacky for a greasy spoon diner...unacceptable for a \""wine bar\""! I won't be returning."
21715,3,"Food is delicious. I had the Vegenini, it is like a vegetarian pizza. I loved it. The potato fries are also delicious. Customer service is always friendly."
39307,3,"Had dinner here on Friday night and I'm so happy I finally got to try this place. At first I was a bit confused by the two menus but our waiter nicely explained how one listed their Chinese-American dishes and the other authentic Chinese. My husband ordered from the American and I decided to go with the Chinese Kung pao chicken. The orange chicken was the best I have ever had! The Kung Pao was pretty good too. The ginger gives it a very unique taste but it was way to spicy for me. Right away my whole face was flushed and my nose was runny. Our waiter was so nice and attentive, I really enjoyed my dinner and will definitely be going back."

The menu offers a little bit of everything, making it a great place to bring an office group with  different tastes.  \n\nThe food portions are large and if your looking for a greasy spoon the burger factory might be your place for a quick bite."
17064,1,"Crap.\n\nCrap crap.\n\nCrap.\n\nIs that not sufficient?  Do you need more than that?  Okay: go there and order a reuben, and see what happens.  First, they'll ask you what type of bread you want.  On my reuben?  I'll take rye, because if it isn't rye then it's not a reuben.  Thank you.\n\nThen they will include lunch meat-style corned beef, which just pisses me off.  Because it doesn't taste delicious, it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria.  And then they have thick ass bread, which, in my opinion, is what you put on a sandwich when you don't want people to realize that what's in between the slices of bread sucks ass.\n\nOr, the nachos.  They use movie theater cheese (which is a one-star bonus for me, only reason they have 2 stars) but the chili is totally tasteless.  I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing.  Not bad, not good, just *nothing.*  Here's a tip: find something that tastes and heave it into the pot.  Just a thought.\n\nI hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices.  Because the place sucked a fat one."
48124,1,"I love the concept of Container Park, but the execution not so much.  They do succeed at bringing diverse groups of people together in a common area.  Comes complete with screaming kids everywhere though.  My biggest gripe is that important details were overlooked in the planning phase. \n\nThe live music stage is a very nice touch.  All of the dining options require customers to order from a window instead of table service.  All of the dining places had long lines for food.  Bars had long wait times and seating is minimal.\n\nFor people with young children, this is an ideal spot to take family.  The kiddos can play on the giant playground in the middle or run and whack each other with foam blocks on the stageside lawn."

32387,1,"Very subpar in every aspect.  I'd like to give it one-star but I'm strangely in a generous mood today.\n\nHad the ham and cheese crepe.  The crepe is overly sweet; very stingy on the fillings; a paper-thin sheet of ham and some sort of runny, bland tasteless cheese.\n\nThe coffee tasted as if it had been sitting in the thermos since early morning-which it probably was.\n\nOverall not good and expensive-$16.  Granted it is Montreal and it is on a prime location.  Still $16 is in no way justified for the lousy crepe."
18123,4,"We got off to the wrong foot. The man at registration was rude. YADA YADA YADA. My stay was fantastic so I didn't knock off a star for that. Problem was resolved quickly and painlessly. So i was off to my next adventure!\nMy room was in the palace tower (I'm pretty sure that was what they call it). It was very nice. I had a lovely view of the south strip and could see the fireworks at Treasure Island. I also had a nice view of the west side of the Las Vegas valley. \n\nI went to Cleopatra's Barge (which I haven't been to in probably ehhhh a long time) and had a nice time. Not exactly a night club but fun in a very relaxed RETRO way.\n\nAll in all, the Palace will always be \""THE\"" Palace."
22055,0,"Update - August 2009.\nUgh. It's all over. The Luau Buffet is no longer held poolside with fire dancers and other entertainment. Now the Luau Buffet is a very sorry standard buffet at heightened prices. There are free \""mai tai\"" drinks provided, but even those can't put back the party atmosphere I experienced at the poolside Luau two years ago. If anyone suggests it, you're better off finding something less expensive (it was $25/per on a Saturday) as putting a sweet sauce on chicken breasts does not a luau make. Sorry, Imperial Palace, we know the economy is bad, but this was once of the worst cuts we've seen over the past year.\n\nNot the best buffet I've ever been to, but the combination of the food and the show made for a wonderful evening. The Luau Buffet and Show only runs through the summer months, so if you're thinking about going, be sure to make plans early. Also, spend the extra $$ and get the VIP package - special give-aways, better table service, better view. Don't plan to get too loose on the \""free-flowing\"" mai-tais and pina coladas advertised as endless. We needed to drink quite a few before we finally found one with some alcohol. But, fun none the less. Reminiscent of what I envision as a \""typical\"" Las Vegas dinner show from bygone days."
7095,1,"I hope you don't think that I'm too critical by the end of this review. \n\nBut honestly I've been to better dive bars. The first thing that struck me was the location. Crap! It shares a wall the the Trunk Space, on a corner of Grand Ave and 7th ave I believe. Getting there, maneuvering the strange sharp turns, and then locating a parking spot definitely downs my drinking enthusiasm.  -1 for initial placement. Although, if you happen to be catching a show at the Trunk Space, this place is 5 steps away. \n\nWhen I first entered the place, I admit I was impressed with the interior decor. The whole tiki-style theme was nice and consistent. Except for all the stuff behind the bar. I mean a piece of paper with a note written with a marker saying \""We have the right to refuse anyone service\"", just screams \""low class establishment here\"" to me. At least the air conditioning and lighting were comforting.\n\nThe service was decent. The lack of crowd allowed my party and I the utmost dedicated attention. I ordered a large pitcher of Blue Moon, which if you have a three person group, the price is pretty good. You get three smaller than usual frosted glasses which I liked. However, as a fan of Blue Moon, I was unimpressed by how bland the white ale tasted!! I'm sure it was flat. It was cold though. Ill give them that.\n\nOverall, I would come back again, but only if I happen to be at the Trunk Space. I see no reason to deliberately make this place my destination.\n\nBy the way this place is Cash Only......"

Picking up your pizza you can't help but notice the adult store's window with silhouettes of women in devil costumes. Seeing this gave me the creeps. What would a little child think?\n\nThis Dominos needs to relocate to a more family-oriented shopping center."

39007,0,"The place is not too bad within the general douchebaggy community. The problem of this place is the staff!!! The girls in the bar are there spotting the potential big tippers, I don't blame them but please.... I spent a good while with my card in my hand waiting for my order to be taken while the girls were attending all the boys around me... Fed up, I turned to my husband and told him to try to order himself. He took my place in the bar and within maybe 2 min he was back with drinks for everybody!!!! Shameful!!!\nBut the worst part was at the end... we ordered our drinks and without previous notice from the bar, once we got served and payed of course, this bouncer arrived with the worst manners ever, shouting to us to get out of there. We were really shocked since we were just two couples, quite calm compared with the rest of the audience, not really trouble makers... We told him that if they were not going to let us finish the drinks they shouldn't have sold them to us, right?  Well the bouncer started shouting even more at us and being incredibly rude, we left the place before things would go worse... Horrible experience, never again!"
33913,0,"Applies to E.R.: When you're talking about life and death or your health and well being 3 stars can be a death sentence. I feel sorry that Veterans who took so much risk for our country have to put up with only three, count 'em, 3 star service at a health care facility. If you have the unfortunate opportunity of ending up there then you better know exactly what is wrong with you because I can assure the doctors have little chance of finding out. If your head is missing it will be days before they find out and in that time you will likely be treated for low blood pressure. NOTE: The most competent people were the Air Force personnel. \n\nI had to go to the Emergency Room. I specifically told the doctor what was wrong and he ignored it and treated me for something else. The problem that was causing severe pain was not treated and I was not offered any pain medicine. 6 hours later I thought I was being punk'd and reminded the doctor why I came in. He had completely forgotten! This guy examined me, took blood samples, saw obvious signs of past trauma and then forgot. It was akin to showing him an arrow being shot through my head and then being treated for a hangnail.\n\nThree words, avoid, avoid and avoid. What a shameful thing to do to those who served. Bad service, poor care and horribly maintained Emergency Room."
12162,1,"Took a business group to Harvest last night.  I realize their committment to locally sourced ingredients means a variable supply, but our experience was extreme.  They did not have one fish dish listed on their menue.  They had only two of their steak special, and so could not accomodate orders from our group.  They had only three of their dessert special, so similar issue.  They could not provide one request for a diet Coke.  They ran out of straws for one person's drink.  This was not a big group.  The place wasnt overly busy.  They were just apparently not prepared to be open last night.  Disappointing.  Will not take clients there again."

I have been here before food is ok service was good but this time service was terrible , we sat there for 20 min no one showed up I got up and asked one of the girls in front for help and that didn't help, finally a waiter showed up to say hello and left as fast as he showed up. I say if they were busy Ok but they weren't. That's the last time I'm going to go there and would not recommended anybody to go there."

I ordered the salmon and specifically told the waiter that I wanted it close to rare, but the salmon that was brought out was well done. I can understand if you cannot cook the salmon rare.. but if u are telling me that you can, you better bring it out rare. my friend had the porchatta - said that it was ok, but felt like spam. overall, very blah food."

Then why do they only accept cash most of the time if you go there between 1-4 am? I don't carry cash and especially not that early. I then have to drive all the way in to Queen Creek to get Jack in the Box. That's insane to only take cash (it's not just a one night thing either.) I'm sick of this McDs. Of all the bad service I've had, this one is the worst."
15580,3,It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did.

Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!
6857,3,"Not the best hotel in the world, but the previous reviewer hasn't been there lately.  They've earned their 3 stars (of 5).  Comfy beds, lots of space, not much service (except if you call the front desk).  My main complaint is that 1/4 of the times I've been there (4 weeks, weekdays only) over the course of a work project) the other clientele has been a little...  I dunno...  loud and drunk.  Not always, but sometimes.  After all, though, check hotwire, they're always on there with the *deals*"
4865,0,"i would love to give it zero stars if I could, (Yelp? maybe a feature you can implement??) anyway, bottom line I WISH i'd stopped by here and read the reviews before plunking down $26 on 2 lunches we could never get back!!\nfood is disgusting, bland, tasteless, hopeless, worse than mediocre, and I could go on and on.\nthere were total of 5 dishes, and rest of the lunch buffet was filled with lettuce, onions, chutneys, yogurt dips with no real veggies to actually dip in. the samosas were leaking of oil, pakoras were nasty didn't taste like pakora batter but stuffed with some dal of some sort to save money, the curries were GROSS ugh!!! and when u enter, u see all these awards plastered on the walls??/ who is handing these out???\ndon't go here...its full of retards serving nasty food that'll make u barf whether u're hung over or not."
37776,2,"So my friend got comped for the room and we got to eat at this buffet for free. I tried the lunch buffet as well as the dinner buffet. Nothing really stood out for me. I don't think I'd pay to come to this buffet. A lot of the food is served in small containers which actually adds to the aesthetics of how the food is displayed. I just remember seeing how cute the chicken wings looked, but the actual chicken wings itself was a bit dry. I tried the bone marrow which my friend raved about.. and I almost gagged. Other than that, the food selection didnt consist of anything special. Still, a special thanks to my friend who got us the free buffet. Beggers can't be choosers."
5254,4,"Ulta is quickly overtaking my love of Sephora since it is so much closer and so easily assisible. They are also beginning to carry more high end brands like Lancome and Benefit. I like that they have a better selection of salon hair products as well as the drugstore brands. NYX is sold here and often goes on sale for buy one get one half off. If you're a follower of beauty blogs you can appreciate the NYX brand as an inexpensive beauty find. This particular store is huge, which allows for plenty of room to meander and shop. The staff greet you as you walk in the door and are always willing to answer questions or look for out of stock items if asked."

Unfortunately, that's where it ends. You can show up at pick up time and no one knows anything about your order and no cake will be waiting for you. I had to settle for something out of the freezer case that wasn't what I had ordered. Very disappointing. In the future I'll spend my money somewhere that's actually interesting in providing good customer service. It's a shame they just don't care."
24172,2,"I prefer Yogurtland for their superior tasting yogurt and toppings, but U-Swirl is better when meeting friends because they have more seating & space, and also because this location is closer to where I live. Dare I say that this U-Swirl is whimsical? With bright colored furniture and large photos of candy mounted on the walls, I feel like a kid again whenever I go here. \n\nI think their yogurt per ounce is pricier than Yogurtland. But I do appreciate some of the unique flavors of their yogurt like Hawaiian Punch. I also appreciate the fact that U-Swirl was started by a local high school student (Green Valley HS). For those of you who didn't know, this location is where U-Swirl all started, and now there are U-Swirls all over Las Vegas & in other states. The service is friendly and the toppings are fresh. I tried the brownie bites, but they just aren't as chewy & delicious as the brownie bites at Yogurtland. \n\nI shouldn't mention another frozen yogurt shop's name so many times in my U-Swirl review, but I just haven't found a place that serves better tasting yogurt than my favorite place."
3748,1,"I tried going here for groceries for a little while and the store was always clean and there was definitely always a lot of eye candy shopping here, but Safeway is kinda pricey... especially compared to the new Walmart Neighborhood Market that just went up down the street, and I've never checked out at this location without having to wait in a line.\n\nI also had a bad experience here a few weeks ago. I wanted to run into a place and grab some light beers, and just happened to be driving by Safeway and thought \""what the hell?\"" So I go in, grab a 6-pack of O'Douls (yes... non-alcoholic beer), and as I'm checking out the 5'2 Indian lady behind the counter (I think her name was Betty... something with double-consonants and short) claimed that my ID was fake! I'm a slightly over 6' and had plenty of stubble that day. \n\nBetty went on to have me repeat EVERY single line on my driver's license. Even after which she said, \""You are not 6', you look around 5'8.\"" This came from a lady who barely came up to my chin. When I told her that was ridiculous she actually made the claim \""this is not your ID\"", from which I started producing my credit card, work id (with photo), and school ID (with photo), which she stared at for 30 seconds while turning over trying to prove they were fake, then grunted and sold me my non-alcoholic beer... all while still acting as if she felt I was some sort of hooligan!\n\nWhen I asked Betty what her problem was, she said that the night before they had been \""raided\"" and her co-workers were given thousands of dollars of fines, and she didn't want to be fined. I understand that sucks, but it is not acceptable to make that interfere with your customer service and make customers feel like escaped prison convicts."
40155,3,"Bangkok 9 is my place to go for lettuce wraps.  Those little chicken filled leafs are awesome.  I've tried to replicate them at home.  They came out good but not as good as those at Bangkok 9.  I think it is the sauce that I struggled with the most because I don't know what it is or what is in it.  I tried to make a citrus and soy sauce.  It was not even close to the real thing.  The lesson I learned from this (drum roll please) for the real thing, just go to the restaurant.  They have good food.  The service is hit and miss at times.  There is a young woman working there who speaks perfect English and is attentive.  The older gentleman speaks with broken English and does not always come around to refill drinks.  I don't much care about that, though.  As long as the food is good.  And the food has always been good the times that I have dropped by.  The one time I was the slightest bit disappointed was when I ordered the masarman curry.  It had a great flavor.  I love my meat and potatoes.  What turned me off were the peanuts.  A good portion of them were burnt with a bitter taste.  Whatever.\n\nThis is an easy place to miss if you do not know where to look.  I had driven by it a few times before I finally spotted it.  It is next to the Pier 1 Imports store in the Walmart shopping center right on Cheyenne and Rainbow."

Loads of choices.  The sake sangria and lychee martini were quite tasty but will sneak up on you! Yikes!   \n\nIt is very nice that the happy hour menu is offered in the entire restaurant.  You don't have to worry about cramming into a tiny bar or lounge space.  We were seated at a nice table just like any other diner.  \n\nKabuki is very nice inside and the food presentation was flawless.  Just about everything we ordered was a win!   The only miss I recall was the tofu appetizer.  Bland and boring.  The fried mozzarella wrapped in seaweed were clever and tasty!\n\nI'll definitely return and you should go check it out!
46105,3,"Well I've stayed at a few hotels since I've been in Vegas for a couple of months and the Downtown Grand isn't bad at all. It has a very retro feel to it with the ocean scenic colors. It also has some very modern furniture that I would not expect for the cost of the room. Flat screen tv, full size closet/cabinet and dresser draws. Basically everything you need except for a refrigerator...\n\nThe biggest dislikes I have is all those hidden fees. They say free internet but I believe that's part of the hidden $12 daily hotel fee that they failed to mention. Also there's a $50 a day hold for damages if need be. Also if you opt to park across the street at the self parking, be prepared to look over your shoulder in that spooky garage.  \n\nAll in all not bad for it to be downtown Vegas. The restaurants in the lobby are what I consider on par with the rest of the Grand experience."
4709,1,"I hear this place is hopping at around 2am.  I were here around midnight, on a Saturday night and it was dead!  The floors were sticky and the service was lacking.  I may try it again sometime but I'm not racing to go back immediatley."
28517,2,"Not located the best looking strip mall but it's actually pretty quiet. I live right around the corner so I drop in here all the time.They updated the interior recently and it's a bit more comfy now. They got rid of the buffet, which I was sad about at first, but I honestly think the food has gotten better and fresher since they did. It's consistently pretty good, but I can't say it's amazing -  if you're craving Chinese this will definitely get you what you want at a pretty good price."

24340,1,"Like using Ketchup on spaghetti.\n\nAfter much consideration, and a coin flip, we decided on coming to Panna Thai for dinner last night.  The interior was clean and inviting.  I loved the giant golden elephant paintings on the wall and their Christmas tree made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  \n\nThe service was fine as well.  The food is what deems Panna a 2 star joint.  We ordered the fried calamari and the pad thai with tofu.\n\nFried Calamari - Large rings of calamari were a bit tough and quite dry.  The breading had an interesting flavor that wasn't offensive, just not something I was eager to eat.  It was served on a plate of shredded lettuce, but much of the breading fell off, creating a swamp like pile of dusty breading, very unpleasing to the eye.\n\nPad Thai w/ tofu - The Pad Thai here uses a tamarind sauce, which tasted like Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) and not much else.  This was like boiling spaghetti noodles, adding ketchup and calling it Italian.  The sauce was heavy, and slumped on my palate long after dinner.\n\nPanna falls short of being good Americanized Thai food.  I prefer the authentic flavors found at other restaurants (where's the kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, galanga, etc...??) \n\nBottom Line: Panna Thai is clean and inviting with good service, but the food leaves a lot to be desired."
47439,1,"Tried the double char cheeseburger today. \nIt might as well have been the In & Out Double Double, it was that close.\nThe onion rings are nice and unboring though.\nFast friendly service, nice place to sit and eat.\nAvoid the lunch hour line if you're gonna give this place a try.\n\nNo WOW factor about this burger at all, I think I should've ordered the Santa Barbara which has avocado and sourdough -- it would've been an improvement.\nThere are a lot of better burger places in the valley including my standby----\nWhopper with no lettuce, extra tomatoes, extra onions, and put some BBQ sauce on the bottom bun."

9893,4,I almost always stay at excalibur when I go to Vegas. I went this last Thursday and had booked a room for $22.00 a night (with my MLIFE rewards) when we got there to check in they upgraded us to a suite for free. I have NEVER stayed in a suite before so it was soooo nice and pretty. I loved it! There is so much food to choose from from all price ranges. This is actually my favorite place to play slots even tho I often walk to the other casinos. I am never disappointed with this casino.

6633,2,"Is the food good? No. Is the service good? Actually, yes. On Monday night my 3 friends and I had several margaritas (because they're 1/2 off!!) and dinner there. The bartender was very nice and the drink was appropriately strong, and the table waiter was also very pleasant to 4 of us. The place was not that happening on this particular night  - I think it's partly because of the holiday emptiness the college town experiences + ultra cold night - so no body was kicking us out of the door in hurry. We stayed and chatted long after taking care of the bills, and they didn't seem to care. \n\nHas the food been authentic or anything close to that, the dining experience would have been a bit more pleasurable on palate, but over all, not too much to complain about."

39661,0,I thought it was the worst Mongolian Stir Fry I have ever eaten.  I love Mongolian food.   I was expecting more asian flavor.  It had more like a BBQ flavor.  I didn't care for the service.  I found the servers were trying too hard.  I thought they were extremely annoying.  I do like when they ask if need I something but not everytime I take a bite.  I would never go back mainly because of the service.  I want to be leff alone and enjoy my meal.  Don't try to upsale every single thing on the menu.  It seemed like to me the waiters and waitresses were forced to do this.  If they didn't they would be canned.  I didn't like the atmosphere either.  It was like sports grill/ asian.  Just odd.  Another stupid Corp American type restaurant.  Don't waste your money on this place!!!!
11625,4,"Best pizza I've had anywhere.  Perfect, perfect and I mean perfect crust.  Thin, chewy, smoky and sweet.  Lots of interesting toppings that center around fresh, local produce.  I deeply envy the regulars here."
48136,1,We ordered ribs to go and when we went to pick them up the staff didn't even acknowledge me. Took about 10 mins before they actually brought over my food - which they didn't even ask if I was there to pick up food. The ribs weren't amazing. Felt like they were made from a neighbor's backyard. Was hoping that they would be fall off the bone kind of ribs but they were definitely not.
21773,3,"Mac n Cheese was damn good. Homemade bleu cheese was even better. Service was a little weak, but overall the dive bar/ lounge atmosphere and great beer selections are solid.\n\nWish they would expand the menu"
15546,3,"An early arrival to Vegas gives us an opportunity to go off the strip and enjoy a couple of breakfast eateries. The Egg and I has a cute name and an old cowboy ranch feel to it. The menus are newspapers and the servers are friendly!\n\nFood (4 Stars): I ordered the corned beef hash with over medium eggs and the banana nut muffin. I'm usually not a banana nut fan, but this muffin changed my mind. It was full of spice and flavor, you can definitely taste the banana. The corned beef hash was pretty good with the shredded style corned beef. The seasoned potatos were DELICIOUS and I wish I could've had more.\n\nWe ordered the Cinncinati 4 Way plate with onions. It is pretty much spaghetti pasta with chili and onions on top. Our group was intrgued by the ingredients so we ordered it. It was amazing!!! Who knew that chili and spaghetti pasta can go together so well?? Topped with cheese and onions, this is my dish!\n\nWe couldn't finish all of our food due to the large portions, so definitely come with an appetite. The food is still good after being reheated.\n\nService (4 Stars): Our cute server was friendly and humorous. She frequently checked up on us and refilled our cups, she even got us another table because ours was cramped.\n\nBottom line: Hungover? Hungry? Feeling like stuffinf your face? Egg ans I will satisfy it all."
999,3,"Cheap beer, dive bar, great company, and holy crap--did everyone just eat a hojillion peanuts and dump their shells on the floor?  Really? What the hell, it's a great dive bar.  I cant' even hate on it.\n\nThe booths are big and comfy, the setting is as nonpretentious as it gets, and the peeps are chill as hell--and most likely you're not gonna run into many undergrads ;)"
7599,4,"So you will stop when the GPS tells you to, and you will instantly double check the address. You will question yourself, because this just CANNOT be it. You expect a wine cellar and what you have is this dinky liquor store. You enter the dinky liquor store and it couldn't be more anonymous, but if you just stay true (Navy term I believe) there is a staircase that leads down. Normally this is a bad sign, never go downstairs in a dinky liquor store - this one is the exception. I find the experience to be a little Narnia-like. But it isn't Narnia; it's a really cool looking wine bar. \n\nAnd this would be cool if this was it - but wait, there's more.\n\nThere is also a lounge area where people can relax and hang out and the rumor says that they play live music down here. I have totally missed it every time, but I cannot blame the establishment for my failure to plan. \n\nThey have a nice wine selection, and a limited but eclectic beer selection.\n\nI have not been here for the live music, so I cannot say much about the clientele.. but the establishment is really nice. First I was put off by the way I came here (through the dinky liquor store) but now I feel that belongs in a speakeasy kind of way."
276,4,Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.
43796,1,"Not sure if this is just normal for a place that just opened but pretty much everything was bad for us. Too bright lighting, dirty seats, hard to read menus, bad salsa, weird chips, terrible margaritas, slow to no service (had to ask for someone to come to the table) $18 for fajitas that contained 6 small shrimp? 3 tiny tortillas with that? Yikes, won't be back..."
37721,3,"I was really surprised that Vegas stepped it up and put a Steak 'n Shake in the valley!  I come from Chicago, where Steak 'n Shakes are all over the place.  They no longer sell the Tuna Melt, which was what I always ordered back then.  This particular Steak 'n Shake doesn't give you the extra large Oreo cookie to go with your Oreo shake, whereas they do so everywhere else I have been to.  \n\nLocated inside South Point Casino, there is almost always a line to get seated here.  We went around 11pm and  were seated right away.  Their food is excellent all the time and service is quick."
2558,3,"For a municipal course, Dobson Ranch is tops.  This is the place to go for a good, cheap afternoon round of golf during the summer.  It's a well maintained traditional course, with large trees lining the fairways, and grass everywhere.  Dobson Ranch is great for beginners, as the ball is playable from anywhere that is not in someone's backyard.  It's slice-friendly too, with most of the out of bounds areas sitting to the left of the fairways.\n\nDobson Ranch is a standard par 72, except instead of having 4 par 3s, 10 par 4s, and 4 par 5s; it has 5 par 3s, 8 par 4s, and 5 par 5s.\n\nAt only $10 to walk on a summer afternoon, this is one of the best values in the Valley."
21421,3,"Used my Groupon ticket here - picked it up on a whim and it was well worth it.  Ordered the special of the day - Chicken, Shrimp, Chicken, Mussels, Andouille Sausage on Saffron Rice cooked with Peppers.  My friend ordered the veggie lasagna.  I didn't try his veggie lasagna, bc we were already eating dinner together and it seemed fruity to do so! I'm insecure ;]\n\nFood was delicious.  It tasted very good and served in reasonable portions.  It definitely had a home-cooked feel to it which for some reason always hits the belly a little better than \""restaurant\"" food.  It was like fireworks going off in my mouth - the way the melange of flavors were distinct, yet blended well.  One word to describe it would be: Elegant - defined as \""simple but genius\""\n\nService was attentive and informative.  I didn't even finish my diet Coke, I mean, Coke Zero (manlier) and server had my next one ready (kinda just had to drink it bc it was prepared)\n\nHow did this place miss out on 5 stars?  Dishes were slightly overpriced. Slight meaning like $1 or $1.50 overpriced.  Will I come here again? Absolutely.  I recommend it highly as it is a perfect blend of home-cooked and deliciousness.\n\nParking lot sucks - it's gravel ;/\n\ndmo out"
49690,4,"If you don't like eggstasy, then I don't like you.  Honestly, best breakfast I've ever eaten.  Steak and egg skillet was fantastic.  If there's two of you, split one.  Then order a SMALL PORTION off the \""eggstasy\"" selection in the back of the menu, I highly recommend the brioche French toast or the pancakes with pumpkin cheesecake sauce (make sure to order the pancakes crispy.)  I've never tasted anything like either.  The chorizo grits are also tasty (just like chilli), but you won't have any room for sides.  So obviously I love the food.  Service:  been there twice, Candace and Michelle are GREAT.  Michelle actually insisted on sending us home with to go cups of coffee (for no extra charge.)  Everything comes out so fast, it'll boggle your mind.  The owner, Pete, gave is extra pancakes out of the blue, on the house.  I honestly felt like I was a part of some social experiment where scientists were studying my reactions to insanely delicious food at fire sale prices.  \nPrice:  30 bucks for a fantastic meal for two?  Including coffee?  Hell yes.\nWait:  been there twice, waited 20 min at the bar the first time (the bar tender kevin is now my boy), sat right away the second.\nAmbiance:  too loud, but I didn't really care.  There were flies because it's an open air restaraunt, honestly the only thing that bothered me at all.\nPretty sure this is the first review I've ever written.  That's because this place is the shiat.  Not really sure how they're gonna stay in business for very long with those prices, so you might wanna get in the car now.  I SAID NOW!\nPs if anybody happens across any of the recipes for any of the dishes at this restaraunt, I will pay you one million dollars.\nPps Pete, if you're reading this, why aren't you open at 11:21 pm?  Also, I would consider nominating you for the Nobel peace prize if you implemented delivery.  Maybe if you delivered to Syria, ISIS would chill the phuk out."
13257,3,"I came here first time with an educated shooter that already had guns i could use. This was my second time ever shooting but first at a range. They sold us the bullets and targets gave us protective geer and off we went to an enclosed room to shoot very simple short breefing. Place is nicely set up central location, staff was nice. The other two people went to get certified not the paper test but shooting test i decided i needed more time to practice. The only thing i really did not like was how many tourist were there. I really hope they open another location more for locals. The prices are to high because its geared toward tourism. I like the fact classes are free though. I went on a monday around 9am not to busy but as the day progressed the place got packed so go during the week early otherwise you will be waiting. I will be back to practice more and test taking but i think im going to save some money and look for a cheaper place for bullets and targets."
37179,0,"Pharmacists & techs are rude. Had to have my Rx faxed over TWICE. And instead of being nice, they were rude & short & spoke about us. There is a pane of glass separating us, trust me, we can see you.\nVery disappointed in this location. Would not recommend ever coming here again. \nI am definitely thinking about calling corporate to file a complaint in the morning. Nobody with a the flu & bronchitis should have to go through that. \nSave yourself the misery & take your business elsewhere."
41123,4,Awesome tasting pizza!
33696,0,"I switched insurance a couple years ago and needed a new ppo doctor, this office was the one my gf used.  From the start, I had bad experiences with this office.  I was never assigned a doctor and always given a random doctor or nurse.  I have 2 different tests done that required 3-5 business days for results.  Both times I did not receive a call back after 10 business days and had to call more than 2 times for my results. \n\n My biggest complaint however comes from my last visit.  On that day the office had a \""$50 see the doctor sign outside\"" the office was absolutely packed with people that did not have insurance.  I waited for 45 min before I sent to the back and waited another 45 min.  I finally left because I had to go back to work.  I paid $25 for the visit and was charged a $50 \""no call no show\"" fee.  They would not remove the fee from my account.  \n\nThis office is ran extremely poor starting at the front office.  Even without my latest issue I was ready to change doctors.  I would not recommend them to anyone."
27663,4,Everything about our dining experience was absolutely superb!  Outstanding service and some of the most delicious steak ever.  The salad bar is incredible too!  I highly recommend it.
11177,2,"Looking for a fast and reasonably good lunch option around Desert Inn and Eastern? Lindo should make your short list. They have reasonably priced lunch specials and they are slightly overstaffed which helps to get you in and out pretty fast if you need to get on with your day. \n\nI've had my share of experiences with Lindo...look at my previous reviews, it's a love - hate thing. They've messed up my orders. They can't seem to refill the salsa and sometimes the chips. And no not everyone wants fried fish tacos. But sometimes none of that crap matters. You go in and don't have to wait forever to be seated. And you'll don't pay out the nose for what you get. Sometimes...that's all you need. \n\nBack up to 3 stars...and removed from a special list."
2642,2,"Wow, lots of hate on here about this place. Gave me second thoughts about coming here, but we had coupons. Service was very good.  Food was reasonably good, but that's kind of what you expect from a chain. I had the chicken under a brick, and it was just fine.  I didn't care for what my Mom got (chicken scallopini, I think), but she likes that. My wife had the eggplant Parmesan and enjoyed it as well."
35712,1,"Finally went to try this place, since I had heard it was so good.  I thought it was okay.  I think In and Out and even Five Guys is better.  I got the smashfries, they were just kind of dry and plain.  I got the sin city burger, again just okay.  I like fried onion and egg in a burger, but it just wasn't as flavorful as other places.  Glad I got to finally try it, but probably won't be heading back."
35005,0,"Went last night. Keep in mind I've been here dozens of times.  Our server didn't give a hoot about our table of five. We ordered the pickles and they were slimy. Asked very nicely if we could sub them and the manager was like \""hi! Um.....nooooo\"". You lost a customer thanks to that smirky jerky \""manager\""."
30135,4,"We have been to all of the buffets on the strip over time.  I will tell you that for the price and quality, this is one of the best!  Clean, fantastic quality of seafood and so many other items to choose from if you are not a seafood person.  GREAT buffet!"
25612,3,"Really Excellent food, with an authentic feel. I've had Vietnamese food in many locations in Montreal (and other cities) and this one ranks high for service, and overall food quality. Looking forward to trying something new on their menu on a future visit !"
30657,4,Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.
29087,0,This has to be some of the worst sushi and burgers I have had in a very long time.\n\nSushi was loaded with rice and not very flavorful.  Burger tasted like a frozen patty and again lacked character and flavor
23308,2,its a nice place. the rum bar makes an 'ol fashioned' (with rum) that i had never had. it was pretty good... cant really say the same about the food though. it was 'ok'. im jamaican expected better. the portions were very small for the price. i'll probably go back and try it 1 more time... or at least for drinks. \n*kanye shrug*
12955,1,"Went to this restaurant because a friend wanted to try and had made a reservation for us there. Somehow we still had to wait with reservations... Considering it was a french restaurant with a large amount of review I figured it was okay to have high standards. Boy was I wrong. \n\nHospitality was great, very accommodating to change my order without any further questions. \n\nI order the Chicken Grandmere and it came out too salty and dry. It was so dry I drank 2 glass of water and gave up after eating maybe an eighth of it. The waiter was generous to switch my order to the Chicken Paillard which came very fast! However the chicken was again dry and the flavor just didn't taste right. \n\nAfter we left, I went to McD to get myself a 10 piece nugget meal."
21940,4,Honestly the best sandwich I have ever had.  The bread was soft and delish.  I had the Italian and hubby got a turkey.  We both loved our sandwiches!  I am bummed that we found this place on our last day there because I would have gone back.  It was quick take otu service and we were able to eat right there to enjoy the sights.  Mmmmmm wish we had these back home!
17631,4,"This is by far my number one go-to place when I'm in Vegas, if only for an hour or two. As of the time of my last visit, this was the only casino I visited where you can still gamble with actual coins! \n\nThere's nothing quite like the thrill of the clattering sound of dozens and dozens of nickels pouring out of a slot machine!"
3281,1,"I had a decent time here the other night while visiting Scottsdale... It was a Thursday, 2 for 1 drinks til midnight, but I thank my good time to the company I was in and the lovely people watching the crowd here provided. \n\nLet's start with problem numero uno- The place is located in a Safeway shopping center... no joke! So get your groceries and come shake your booty all in one trip ;) Now I know Scottsdale has a rep, and to be honest, I do enjoy surrounding myself in that scene once in a while but seriously could not get over the fact that while sitting on their \""posh\"" patio, I was watching the cart boy rounding up stray shopping carts. Location location location, this place fails miserably at that. \n\nThe drinks were okay... call me crazy but I actually prefer to taste some alcohol in my martini. \n\nAnd the decor in the place was a joke! You walk in to a big open room... think Rocky Pointe spring break style back in HS when you went to those 20$ all you can drink parties. All that was missing was the video crew recording the raunchy females, cougars in this case. The chairs/seating in the car were cheap looking and overall reminded me of Ikea.\n\nOn the plus side, it was pretty busy but chill enough were my friends and I could enjoy each others company without being knocked into by others.\n\nFor wanting a chill night with great people watching this place is great. But please get over your posh sophisticated attitude because you are far from it and the place would actually have more potential if you realized it. My favorite part of the night... A cougar with a much older sugar daddy. She walks away from daddy to be swept away my 20someyhing boy toy, only to turn around, and hang her purse on daddy before heading to the dance floor to grind on the boy. Poor daddy was left outside, purse and all, looking like a fool. Made for decent people watching. I sadly left and don't know the outcome of this.... If you were there last night and saw these scene please do tell :)"
11644,2,Overrated.  While the food here is good; it's not worth the long wait.
3100,3,"Yum! Temari does sushi right! They have other items on their menu, but I've only had their sushi. The flavors in each roll are so unique, we ordered 3 rolls: spicy tuna, lollipop roll and their version of a volcano roll. \n\nWe have never tasted anything as good as these rolls. Very fresh fish, amazing taste, and the service was very nice too.\n\nThe place is pretty small, so expect a tight squeeze, but definitely worth while."
34734,1,My impression of the New Al's.....\n\nI was thrilled to see Al's was open again and stopped for a hot dog....\nI knew exactly what I wanted but glanced at the menu to make sure it was the same and my eyes popped out of head!!!\n\nOMG.....the prices have JUMPED!   I asked if the hot dog was bigger than it used to be..thinking that would be at least a reason for the price hike...one person said yes...the other owner? said no....\n\nTurns out the hot dog was the same size...still a good hot dog...but I was not happy paying about $1.50 more for the same size hot dog.\n\nLet's get to the fries...which I have always enjoyed as they remind me of the hot dog joynt I grew up going to in Chicago....the fries were o.k....but there was sooooo much salt on them and so many old looking fries I just couldnt eat them.\n\nI am sure I will be back to try the beef...only because Lukes SUCKS....\n\nUnfortunately now that Al's is charging as much as Lukes...their beef will  have to be pretty darn good to keep me as a customer.\n\nOverall....very dissapointed....\n\nNote to the owners...... You really need to have above average food to compensate for your price hike if you want to not end up closing down again.\n\nJust because we are in Scottsdale doesnt mean we are willing to throw away money on bad food!
5727,3,"My favorite neighborhood bars. Great drink prices, the machines are loose, and there is always a few cute smiles working.\nPizzas are really good and half off on saturdays. \nFirst impressions from the outside is that the bar is old and small but when you get inside it has a nice neighborhood bar feeling. Like the show Cheers.  They have a restaurant area and a bar. They have an abundance of flat screens for the games and they will even change the channel for you for your favorite team. They have a large banquet area that tends to be busy all the time with different car groups and receptions. \nI really like the Fellini's pizza. The bread is homemade and the cheese is delicious. The tacos on Tuesday are really good too. They are american style but they hit the spot. \n\nFYI\nI have seen families there with the kids after sport games so I guess its a kid friendly restaurant."
17033,2,"Lots of stuff and fun to explore, but I asked a guy if they had any #10 percussion caps for black powder.  He just shrugged and said \""don't think so\"" and went about putting a sticker on a shooting bench.  He was young and I assume he doesn't care about customer service.  Had a great experience at the gun counter though.  Spoke with a very nice guy named Jon, very nice and knowledgable.  I overheard him talking to a young couple about gun safety and what a good stater gun is.  He was great!"
34223,3,BEST chicken pa-nang I have ever had!! Well done!
25661,2,"Fun place and 5$ dollar pitchers during he week. Here's my only issue , on some days , they create 2 lines , one pays 5$ to get in and goes faster (this money goes into the bouncers pocket) and they don't check ID as much and the other line moves slower and check ID more intensly. At the same time , Thursdays are filled with 16 year old girls."
29243,2,"A surprising little find at McCarran International  when I was agonizing over waking up at 4.30 to catch a 7am flight. \n\nTofu breakfast Tacos....yes....not on the menu but ask for it. With a greasy ranchero sauce and a flour burrito wrapped around the grilled soft tofu this was uplifting in the morning. I had cheese on mine (oh my) but you could easily veganize this without. \n\nI thought that was as lucky as I could have gotten...and then I tried their Medium Red Salsa (note: they have a pretty decent salsa bar). Heaven on earth. The combination of the tofu taco and the salsa set the tone for my gastronomical adventure on the trip to come. I also needed a pack of gum right after.\n\nTheir menu of tacos/burritos/bowls is extensive and there are many veggie options that include tofu. The people working here were very sweet and helpful. Note that the taco I had was rather greasy and I didn't necessarily like that part of it. \n\nConsidering the airport generally sucks for any meal option for the vegetarian/vegan, 360 definitely helps even out the equilibrium. In relation to other airport establishments I'd give 360 a 5 star review. But in relation to other restaurants, 360 would have to get a 3. \n\nI have to say that my tofu breakfast taco with a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks made this flight a lot more bearable. \n\n(360 is located near the B gates - Southwest)"
34338,4,"To anyone looking for a nanny agency, this is the one to use! Janet, the owner, is very much involved in the process of finding \""the perfect fit\"" nanny for any family. She is very knowledgable about her nannies and is a great resource for any questions I had about hiring a nanny. Janet has a disposition that set my mind at ease.  After meeting personally with Janet, I felt confident that choosing to have a nanny vs. other childcare, was the way to go! \n\nThanks to Janet for her awesome service!"
5243,2,"Took my two boys here (ages 8 & 9) on their spring break. It wasn't very crowded, which was nice.  We purchased 4 \""1 hour ride\"" passes for $22/each.\n\nThe employees were slow moving. Wasting our time, walking and working at a tortoises pace. My son stood in line to ride the solo cars, he was well over the red line; at least an inch over yet was told her was \""too short\"" and not allowed to ride. \n\nThe food was exactly what you would expect, greasy and over priced. \n\nWe had fun, but this place could be a lot better with a new set of employees."
19014,2,"This place was WONDERFUL the first few times I went, but has been very spotty for the last few months.  I'm not sure what the issue is, but I have noticed new staff, and probably more importantly, I no longer see the owners in there.... ever.  They used to always be there and the food was great, now they're never there and the food is just \""OK\"".  Sucks for me."
2332,0,"My family and I have been dining at Sakana on Elliot for at least a decade and for the most part, have been very satisfied with our experiences. In fact, we would call it one of our \""go-to\"" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was \""borderline\"" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer."
19980,3,Very nice ambiance and service is really nice. The food pretty normal although I think their babaganoush is perfect here. Not overly tangy and the meats are cooked perfectly.
33616,0,"Worst customer service ever. Was just at the blue diamond store because by battery died.  Before shutting my engine off, I  asked an employee if they will install the battery and said yes. The person at counter sounded uninterested when I approached and just instructed me rudely to go pop the hood so another guy can do a diagnostics. They told me I need a new one. After waiting patiently for another 45 minutes, I was told that the manger said they won't be able to install the battery because it will take 45 minutes for them to do it. He added they cannot spend too much time just doing that for me.  And what am I supposed to do? They said I can buy the battery and install it myself. Why is there no zero star rating - it really deserves a negative!"
49844,1,"The food wasn't bad, but it was incredibly slow service. It took forever to place an order and there was no one in line. I probably won't be back .. I can't stand slow service"
29753,2,"Things did not go as well on another visit with a different couple.  First of all, one of my favorites, the Asian Dumplings, having been cut from the menu, are no more.  And Mango for Mango Iced Tea has been replaced by a mango-flavored syrup which was not well received by two of my fellow diners.  A new app, Thai Phoon Shrimp is billed as tender and crispy shrimp tossed in a Sweet & Spicy Chile Sauce, but I and a table mate found the shrimp to be too heavily breaded, and the sauce too cloyingly sweet.\n\nMy Jambalaya Pasta, consisting of chicken, shrimp, and slices of Andouille Sausage mixed in a creamy sauce with linguine was hot and spicy but not that flavorful, and the sausage tasted like thin, spicy pieces of fried hot dog.  As usual, the make your own salad from the Salad Bar, this time with French Dressing, was excellent, although few spring greens were on hand to go with Iceberg Lettuce and spinach leaves.  Diane very much liked her Coastal Trio of sweet lobster, tilapia, and skewered shrimp.\n\nService was good, and booth seating comfortable."
36513,3,"We came here on a First Friday which worried me a little bit.  Trying to get good service at a location downtown on a First Friday is like trying to get an alligator to drop it's lunch in the middle of it's barrel roll.  (You like that simile?)  Well, we got great service.  Our server was so friendly and attentive and helpful.  It was a huge change from the first time I went to this restaurant when it was called something else.\nI had the Boston Tea Party cocktail: vodka, lemonade, and green tea I believe.  If that's wrong, that's what it tastes like.  It was great.  I love vodka.  For dinner, I had the loaded mac and cheese.  Judge me all you want, it was worth every gram of fat and carbohydrates.  It was filled with lots of chicken and lots of bacon and lots of cheese.  After this meal, I realized how amazing life is that my taste buds have the opportunity to indulge like this."
12785,3,"My best friend and I stayed at Bally's. One morning, slightly hungover we needed to nourish ourselves. We wanted something healthy and fresh to counter act the horrible things we did to our liver the night before. As we explored and got distracted by the free bread samples at Sbarro we saw this sushi place. The staff was so friendly! I ordered the vegetarian roll (which was sufficient, not wow) and my friend ordered the spicy tuna (which she said was SPICY! and also very good quality.  She works in a sushi restaurant and has now become a self proclaimed \""sushi snob\"".) Our bill was also super cheap!"
14360,3,"A group of friends and I decided to try this place out since we were in the neighborhood. I figured this was going to be a super packed biker bar for a Saturday night. To my surprise, the bar was relevantly dead. There were some couples dancing, and a few open seats at the bar. We ponied up to the bar, got some large PBR's and some shots. The bartenders are a bit half of Hooters, bit half of Coyote Ugly. The mega-phone antics got annoying real fast. That is probably the only thing I really hated about it. They had a photo booth in there which was only $3 so my friends and I were all over that!"
38781,1,"Sadly, I have to give a 2-star review to 5-star tasting pizza because the owner is rude and has no customer service skills at all! I am so angry that a place that serves such delicious pizza is run by a man with a nasty attitude that does not know how to appreciate his customers. \n\nA word to the wise for the owner: Have your wife or son take care of the front of house and please stay in the back, away from customers. You are going to end up out of business and it will be your own fault. The pizza is hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten but I would rather gag down some frozen pizza than to be treated like garbage by someone who is making money off of me. Without us (your customers) you do not have a business! Remember that and adjust your attitude accordingly or you will be out of business and flipping burgers in short order!"
11285,1,"Totally Ruined Evening.    \n\nIncompetent to Rude Hosts (I think one is the Owner) After arriving on a Monday Night at 7PM as a group of 5 without Reservations and a Huge Wedding Party we thought the place would be Too Busy, however we were told it would be 5 to 20 minutes for a Table and so we waited in the entrance area with group that Did have Reservations at 7:00 PM.\n\nWe Both were seated around 8:30 pm, no Apologies - Just Arrogance. It was a Table for four with a chair crowded onto the end in the walkway. Two of us ordered the same item and 20 minutes After ordering we were told there was only One Available. \n\nSo even though it was my wife's Birthday Dinner, she gave it up and ordered a Simple House Salad instead, while I just Ordered Soup out of frustration. The other three in the Party got the dishes they wanted and the food finally arrived at 9:30PM - two and a half Hours after we first entered the place.  Even their Garlic Rolls were not refilled after initially bringing a small bowl for five people - I guess they were hoping they could sell appetizers.\n\nI have many times taken out of town guest there, always Arrogance and Drama and some waiting, Yet Never again. Even my out of town guest stated after we left and all we had been through they would never recommend this Restaurant to anyone and tell them to be sure to avoid it. \n\nThey have enough business and they don't care - so why should We. \nIf you go for the Food, it's above average, however be prepared for Arrogance and Long waits with a (Owner) Host that always makes the place Frantic."
47846,3,"Really great deal.  Coffee was a little weak but dad's 3.95 two eggs with hash browns was such a great deal.  My Korean omelette (kalbi, onion and cheese) was flavorful but will probably not try that combo again.  Fun, chatty owner and chef.  Brightly colored walls and decor.  Good morning start."
19141,0,"Attended a recent conference here.  I'm new to the area, and have been to conferences at 3 different locations so far.  This one was the worst.  The facilities are old and drab.  The food was mediocre at best, and the staff took it away quickly.  Breakfast was slated from 7-8, I arrived just before 8 to grab some breakfast and head into the keynote speech.  The entire breakfast was already cleaned up & put away.  Lunch was taken down really quickly too, and there were no morning or afternoon snacks.  Just ice water & iced tea in between sessions.  None of the attendees I talked to were happy, and I know I will not plan any conferences at this facility."
19988,2,"Not really sure what all the fuss is about. The food was fine, but not exceptional by this town, and pricey to boot. Top it off with the \""better than you\"" attitude from the time I called to make the reservation until the time I walked out the door...just not worth it. \n\nLike I said, the food was fine, so if I'm out with others adamant on dining at Todd's then I'd come again. As long as they're also paying. I work too hard for my money to spend it at this place."
15204,3,Great place. I would give it 5 stars if it were larger (and the lines smaller) and if the greeter/server's stringy black hair would have been tied up. It was dragging in the food as she bent over to put the plates on the table.  But I will be back!
10692,0,"Car sales staff are great. The service department on the otherhand, not so much.\nIt took them 3.5 hours to change the oil and rotate the tires. Most of the time my truck was sitting on the rack with no one around. I watched. They had it parked right in front of the window. I dont care how short handed you are, if I have an appointment that was to take 1.5 hours, why am I leaving 3.5 hours later?"
630,1,"So, we had an offer to stay at a friends house for the night and we now regret passing it up. I figured, it would be best to stay close to the airport so we didn't have to deal with the rush hour traffic. Driving in from the Denver area, I asked my girlfriend to look for a place close to the airport. She found this place on Google with very good reviews. I'm not sure why she didn't use TripAdvisor. Probably because I always tell her \""Google Knows everything\"" lol. Anyway, we arrived and were greeted by a nice young lady and the place seemed fine. The lobby area was clean. We made our way to the room, which upon first glance seemed okay. The sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean. However, as we made our way in, I noticed the musty odor that is mentioned in other reviews. I decided to look at some reviews and see if maybe we were the lucky recipient of a room that had not been renovated yet. After reading the reviews and comments from the manager, I figured this must be the case. No problem right? Sure, I called down to the front desk and said to the nice young lady \""I see in your reviews, the hotel is having some renovations done and it seems we have received one of the musty smelling rooms that hasn't been addressed yet. Do you have a room that has been renovated, that we can be moved to?\"" Her response was, \""we have been doing some renovations, however not to the rooms. I don't have a nicer room that I can move you to. Sorry.\"" Well, I said to my girlfriend, it's just one night and I don't feel like driving to another hotel. After sitting on the old, run down, uncomfortable love seat watching TV for a while, I said, we should probably move to the bed as it has to be better than this seat. So, we got ready for bed and pulled the comforter back to find sheets that must have been queen size because they definitely didn't fit this king size bed. Whatever, hey the bed has like six pillows on it and two extra in the closet. Great, not, the pillows were plentiful, however they're about half the size of a normal pillow. Okay, I'm tired of trashing the place. Have a look at the pictures (worth a thousand words.) I'm sure with some true renovations, this will be a decent place to stay. I would guess the very good reviews this place has received are the work of some reputation building company or maybe we did just receive one of the older rooms and they didn't want to relocate us. Not returning anytime soon.\n\nStayed October 2013"
44173,2,"I phoned a few days before my visit to ask if they could accommodate an vegetarian - I was going there for a friend's birthday - and they say they would. When I arrived, surprise! they was nothing vegetarian on the menu. They insist to offer me seafood. Very disappointing.\n\nThe place is cute, the food is ok - too greasy and salty for my taste - & reasonably priced, but I wouldn't return because I just felt like it was an hyped place."
7529,4,"Be sure to put this one on your \""must try\"" list if you are a fan of authentic ethnic food! \n\nMenu is extensive with chiefly Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Colombian dishes. Even the drink and dessert menu boasts authentic dishes you will not find just anywhere. \n\nPortions were generous, food was served hot, and the presentation of the serving made me feel like I was away on a brief vacation! \n\nOur server appeared to be the owner. He was genuinely friendly as well as attentive. \n\nWait time for the meal was under 30 minutes, which is what I would reasonably expect for a homestyle restaurant with good food made to order. \n\nIf you are looking for an appetizer, I recommend pork empanadas. They are reminiscent of the meat pies you will find throughout many countries in Latin America. \n\nMeats are well represented on the menu. You will find beef, chicken, pork, goat, fish, and shrimp dishes to suit most tastes. Seasoning is just right, and the homemade salsa was served on the side of my entree in a little ceramic cup, which was tasty and spicy enough to satisfy my craving for heat. \n\nThe tamales as well as the fish are steamed in a banana leaf (typical of Central and South America). The flavor the banana leaf lends to the steamed dish is uniquely different (in case you are not familiar, the banana leaf is not edible). \n\nMost dishes are served with fried plantains, which are out of this world! \n\nDinner prices are reasonable and range from $6.99 to $11.89 per entree. \n\nThe restaurant is very small and the decor is simple and native of the region of cuisine, which adds to the true feel of the experience. \n\nMy gut reaction is to keep returning and eventually try everything on the menu. Our party had the same exact reaction as the previous reviewer as we walked out of the restaurant. \""How does anybody stop at the Taco Bell across the parking lot?\"""
38457,1,"\""Disappointed\"", \""underwhelming\"", \""overpriced\"" and \""over-sauced\"" are all adjectives that came to mind while eating at Imadake. From reading earlier reviews here, I think we ordered all the right items (octopus balls, okonomiyaki, that fried chicken with wasabi mayo dish, jellyfish salad, black cod), but none of them were that great. The cod was rubbery, unlike at other Japanese restaurants in Montreal (for example, Azuma on St-Laurent had a wonderful black cod). The octopus balls were gummy with un-cooked tempura batter in the center and slathered in salty sauce. The okonomiyaki was so completely covered in sauce, that this was the only thing we could taste. That, and a strange, almost cornmeal-y consistency unlike any other okonomiyakis I've experienced (granted I've only had it once before, in NYC, but it was a wonderful streetfood-style dish there; here, not anything I'd recommend, even if you got the sauce on the side--which I would recommend doing, if you choose to try this dish). We didn't order anything to drink, and to the best of my knowledge, only ordered the five small dishes listed above, plus one order of mochi, and it cost us $67 before tip. I certainly won't be returning. I think this place is more about the scene, as it's got a trendy vibe to it; it's a trendy-slathered-in-oyster-sauce kind of place."
38363,4,"This time around I discovered Vosges, Etro, and the Toureneau store.....those alone would make it 5-stars.

I can't put a 2.5, and 2.)The bartender was really cute, and made me the best cadillac margarita ever !! \n\nNow as for Dinner, My steak which I wanted pink in the center, was well done !!! I sent it back because it was a $50 plate, upon its return the steak was still very well done, and the mashed potatoes were missing.  Now for the record, I didn't have to pay for it, so that was nice."
37229,1,"The inside is amazing!!!! @#$%& them for their cover, and not having an ATM or a situationlike Vintage where they escort you to the bartender. They serve em up strong here though.

27417,0,Not a big fan of this place to be honest. Last time i enetered the store the staff were uninterested and not friendly. I find the pricing ridiculous too considering the quality/quantity of some of the products!
14225,2,"This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \""how many\""?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \""no\"".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \""to go\"" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh."

3771,3,"Ups: great staff, regular patrons, eclectic furniture and decorations, unique beans. Feels like a true locally owned shop.

No public restroom (but they'll let you use the one in the kitchen if you ask)."
31664,1,"I've said it before - chains exist so that people know what to expect as far as consistency goes. \n\nThat being said - I've been to the Famous Dave's in Long Beach and I actually enjoyed my meal - both the service and the food. I wish I could say the same about my experience at the North Las Vegas location. \n\nService - our server was around when she needed to be. At least in her opinion that is. She took our order. Brought out drinks, our order, the bill and my change. Otherwise, looking for her was like playing the game - \""Where's Waldo?\"" At least she was friendly. I'll give her that much. \n\nAs for the food - my family ordered the Feast and it came out so fast that it explained why the food wasn't very good. Warm it up and serve it up must be their motto. The meat selections were all dry. Of the ribs, the brisket, the chicken, fries and corn, I like the fries the best. That's saying a lot considering I'm a carnivore and I love my dead, cooked animal meat. \n\nComparing notes of my two experiences at Famous Dave's - I have to suggest that lunch is better than dinner. It stands to reason that lunch will be fresher while dinner will be the meats prepared earlier in the day to be able to serve the evening crowd faster. Either that or the North Las Vegas location is just that bad. One day I may get around to testing this feeling ..."

The decor is cool BUT the tables for two are way too close together and there are a bunch of big tables in the middle that are not being used. \nThe drinks were awful - no creativity at all, especially for an $18 martini. \nThe food was barely edible. I ordered the white bean soup which was bland. The egg roll that accompanied it was so greasy and I couldn't taste the veggies inside. My husband's filet was undercooked. The gnocchi was mushy and tasteless. We opted out of dessert. They gave us a little freebie which was a homemade Madeline with Nutella dipping sauce. Not exciting or gourmet at all.\nWhat a disappointing meal!!!"
18017,4,"If one had asked me 10 years ago if I'd ever eat somewhere with the caliber and focus of an institution like Binkley's, I would have pondered for a minute and probably responded only if it was by the desire and grace of a girlfriend's sufficiently endowed parents or a reception catered by the Google Gillionaires I would surely be surrounded by as a result of a blossoming interest in the tech industry. If one had asked if I'd ever be there at the suggestion of my family who would be equally, if not more, at home at Claimjumper, I wouldn't have deigned the question worthy of response at all.\n\nI would have been (at least temporarily) wrong.\n\nAt the behest of a curious mother living nearby for years, we ventured. Unassuming from the exterior in a strip mall with such high end boutiques as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and sharing a zip code with a cowboy tourist targeted bar that features bull riding of the non-mechanical variety, Binkley's is a tiny destination restaurant that seems slightly uncomfortable with its surroundings, and we were equally slightly out of place with our sinusoidal experience not for control freaks:\n\n- Greeted by name due to party size and expected arrival time being unique resulted in feeling like VIPs confused by their own fame\n- Sending away the sommelier a bit dejected when we unanimously declined wine\n- Realizing our head waitress was a bizarro version of a friend from back home\n- Opting for the highest end 5-6 course tasting menus ($82 - $89, wine pairing $40-50 extra) like non-confused VIPs, but skipping the foie gras surcharge (+$14)\n- Being thankful of no collective food restrictions or allergies to impede chef creativity\n- Impressed by a nearly endless train of experimental amuse-bouches\n- Processing that we were 3-4 courses in without seeing anything we ordered\n- Recalling that some of us were no stranger to this dining style when it's called omakase, except then there's no illusion of input into the majority of the meal\n- Hitting our stride with the hot appetizer, including a superb soft shell crab course\n- Enjoying the best black cod I've ever eaten in a sea of unusual but not quite as enjoyable candidates\n- Starting to feel full around the penultimate course, an amuse of chocolate souffle \n- Understanding without bitterness that soda refills were not free ($2.50) despite the staff's complete lack of hesitation in providing them\n- Taking home satisfaction levels ranging from grudgingly enjoying the expensive dinner show to thinking it was the best overall food experience in months if not years\n\nMenu guidance would be a futile endeavor since, as the head waitresses helpfully informed all non-returnee tables, it turns over completely around every two weeks. However, overall, the seafood dishes were stronger than those with meat, of interest if one is opting for a menu with a single main. Instead:\n\n- Prepare for the onslaught of Kevin Binkley's culinary whims\n- Pretend the a la carte menu doesn't exist\n- Make a reservation well in advance, especially for a weekend\n- Bring your wallet, possibly two\n- Expect to spend at least 3 hours luxuriating over the meal\n- Sigh longingly while realizing how far in the future the next justifiable visit will be\n\nRegardless of apprehension, except in the face of a diet with statistically outlying strictness, it's worth trying once for a special occasion to form one's own opinion. While I could easily think of a number of small tweaks, the application of the formulaic main draw is, in Yelp's terms, semantically indistinguishable from as good as it gets."

5217,0,"Don't go there!\nI had my surgery a few months ago.  It was a horrible experience for me and because of their mistakes, I had to not only take more time to heal, I lost my job.  The guy who was to help me out of bed and get me to walk pulled my gown so hard and tight that he pulled my drainage tube 95% out the day aftery surgery...he was non apologetic, he just didn't care..and the nurse that came after our walk was in shock as to what he had done. She ran to get the head nurse because I bled all over my bed...the fear was that there may be an infection because of what he had done.  It caused me to ruin my furniture when I got home because I wouldnt stop bleeding/draining. My bed and coutch were ruined. While I was at the hospital, When I needed a nurse I would push the button...but rarely did they come when I called, I learned that if I crawled out of bed to the bathroom, there was an emergency button there that I could push and they would come running..   The nurses are overworked and hostile..the environment is non caring...I was treated as if I was an inconvenience. I was not treated as a person who just had MAJOR surgery, I was treated as if I was a 3 day stay at a cheap hotel.  The cleaning staff went through my things when they thought I was asleep, they even sat and watched TV.  The nurse who took me off my drip, forgot to put me in manually for my pain medicine every few hours, by that afternoon I was in sooooo much pain.  The head nurse and the AM nurse argued in my room over this.  My surgery was lumbar fusion, so I was cut on the front and back sides of me...it was painful to say the least.  I got my morning pain medicine at 8am, and got my next dose manually that evening.  it was horrible. Lets talk about food.  When laying in a bed, if there is a tray put on the rolling tray holder you cannot see it.  Some Blonde with a major attitude the 1st morning after my surgery walked into my room and and quipped \""Oh, not hungry or are we just on a fat loss regime today?\""  I was not at all happy with her comments, 1st of all, I didn't even know food was up there, no one told me food had arrived...because of my oxygen tube I couldn't smell. She had no right to make a rude comment which made me feel Fatter than I already am... later that afternoon more food came, she just dropped it on the rolling tray holder, then pushed it away against the wall while she straightened up...then left!  I pushed the nurses button for over an hour, finally when they arrived the nurse brought over the tray.  COLD mush is NOT an option...COLD coffee..no offer to get fresh food...I ended up not eaying till 2 days after my surgery...The STAFF does NOT care!  I wrote a detailed letter to the CEO, Head Nurse and the hospital administrator after I got home.  The CEO responded back to me a few weeks later apologizing and saying he will make sure there is more training for the nurses and staff. That's it??  Never offering to replace my furniture, or asking me what the hospital could do to make things better for me.  \nNow a few months later, I am healing, but I have no job to look forward to returning to because my FMLA ended too soon for me.  I spent over 2000.00 for new furniture. Both of these things would not have been an issue had the staff been attentive and not reckless.  I have heard from many people that they also had bad experiences at Valley Hospital.  I wish I would have known this beforehand.  I would have chosen another hospital to care for me.  After all....it's about a healthy life.\nps...there was an intern there who was very sweet, and even ran to the cafeteria to get me a cold diet coke...she mentioned that she may quit soon because she didn't want to become a hostile nurse like the ones who had been caring for me.  She was very afraid, and I wish her the best in her decision."
27530,4,"In 2007 the Scotsman newspaper placed The Mosque Kitchen top of its list of Best Festival Food and it's clear to see why.  Their curries are authentic, slow-cooked, flavoursome and sold in generous portions.  I have been twice, both times having the chicken curry with rice and a naan bread which was tasty and filling.  \nTo order your food you simply walk past the eating area and into a small room where you order your curry canteen-style and then eat it off a plastic plate.  For vegetarians there are a variety of vegetable curries and these, along with the meat and poultry ones, are all served with rice for less than \u00a35. The service is friendly and effective and I like the eating arrangement where you take your food outside and eat it under the plastic roof while chatting with your mates.\nThe Mosque Kitchen offers genuine value for money and is visited each day by people from a huge range of ethnic and national backgrounds - and for good reason too!"

I don't remember anything being off about the service, so it must have been fine.  If a dining partner specifically wanted to try Vietnamese, I'd come back and try the Pho, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, given that there are many better dining options on Butler St."

49494,0,"When this place first opened, my husband, friends, and I really enjoyed it. The food was great, especially the macaroni and cheese. The atmosphere was what you'd expect when going to a nice dinner out. However, I am not sure what has happened in the last few months. Apparently due to a change in management they have cut their menu down drastically taking away some of the better options, including the macaroni and cheese and salmon BLT. Big mistake. We ordered the 2 for $20, which is a little misleading on menu. You're thinking you get two pizzas plus two salads but you only get one pizza, which in some cases is not even getting as better dealthan just ordering individually. Definitely not worth the money. We spent $29 with tip for a tiny pizza,  two very small salads, and my husband's iced tea. I wouldn't have necessarily minded that if the pizza was really good, but it was not. It was just average. We were left unsatisfied and very disappointed. Also, we went on a Wednesday expecting to find a nice quiet place to eat. Instead, they had half of the restaurant closed off with a DJ playing loud music for what I'm assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually. However, there were only the DJ and a couple people over there during the time we were having dinner. Seems like a waste to have someone preparing so early, playing music so loud that we couldn't even hear each other speak. This place had more of a sports bar feel with Italian food. If you're drinking then you'll probably be ok with the mediocre food. However, if you want a nice dinner, we suggest you go somewhere else. We had thought that this place was going to become one of our new favorites until new management came in and changed it for the worse. The food is not as good, the options are few, and the atmosphere has gone downhill. We definitely won't be going back and we will make sure to warn our friends and family as well."
11746,1,The salsa is so hot that you'll be hating life the next day with a burning chocolate starfish. Waiters are jerky and the food is way to salty..

Ended up calling Amex and reporting the card stolen and didn't pay for dinner. With that we will never return.

It's good for what it is, but it's pretty  much what you'd get at other Panda locations. The thing that struck me about this little food court counter is what you can't see from the front.

The location was great and I'm sure the dinner would've been good too based on the other reviews.\nUnfortunately, my team didn't like anything on the pre-set menu and the restaurant didn't want to work with them on finding alternates.  \nI was a restaurant manager, so yeah, I get it - the food has already been purchased and prepped, etc.  But there were only 8 of us; how hard is it to be flexible?  How hard is it to say, \""Yes of course, but we will have to charge you separately\""?  When a group that is spending a couple thousand dollars on dinner tells you they're going to leave before you even bring the appetizers out, doesn't that concern you?  Wouldn't you send a manager over?\nIf you're Cowboy Ciao, the answer to all of these is no.  What a bummer."
16729,0,"This is possibly the worst \""mexican\"" restaurant I have ever eaten at! Thankfully my fiance and I had our entrees comped as part of a show we were seeing, but even then I felt ripped off by what we did pay for (chips, salsa, guacamole, a margarita, and jalapenos in one of our burritos). There was zero spice, heat or flavor in any of the food, with no peppers in anything except the jalapenos we'd ordered, but even those had been deseeded and washed so they had no spice at all. There was only the barest hint of cilantro in the salsa, and the guacamole was essentially just mashed avocado with a pinch of diced tomatos and white onions thrown in. The burritos were poorly wrapped, falling apart immediately, and poorly assembled, with only a dollop of sour cream and guacamole in the very center of them, so the dominant flavors were of essentially unseasoned rice, beans and meat, the salsa only adding texture with no flavor or kick. The margarita tasted and felt like it had no tequila in it as well. We asked if they had spicier salsa and they did not. All in all this was the blandest, most unsatisfying mexican meal I have ever had, and it was vastly overpriced; the only positive thing I can say is that it was warm and took up space in my stomach.\n\nAlso, they have a \""California Burrito\"" on the menu which is a lie; theirs is merely a vegetarian burrito, not an actual California Burrito which is a carne asada burrito with the works and fries inside."

The hash browns, however, arrived in a sort of \""brick\"" and were greasy and rather tasteless.  I presume they came frozen in that shape and had just been tossed in the deep fryer. Coffee was ok and they left the carafe.  \n\nThe one major negative I must mention is that I didn't realize how expensive the coffee was until we got the bill.  $3.95 per cup for coffee!  If I'm paying four dollars a cup for coffee, there had better be liquor in there.  I realized the rest of the meal was going to be pricey, but this was a bit much."
2974,3,"I'm starting to get the hang of Indian food, and as George Costanza would say: \""I'm Loving It !\"".  So when a friend suggested an Indian buffet, I was all over it.  India Gate is great, not pretentious or over the top, with a good sized menu, oh but I didn't want the menu Georgie, I wanted the buffet.\n\nIt had all of my favorites like palak paneer and matter paneer, plus some new favorites like the minced lamb and green chutney.\n\nI love their lunch buffet and stop by at least twice a month, but I was unimpressed with the lamb vindaloo entree from the menu. The lamb was tough and had gristle. Boo Gristle... Hooray Beer!"
28529,3,"good peruvian food.  granted i've only tried a few places, but my bf is peruvian and we both agreed this place was legit!  we ordered the arroz con pollo (chicken and seasoned rice) and the anticucho de lomo (beef kabobs with sides).... two popular peruvian dishes.  both were yummy.  i really liked the peruvian rice... and the kabobs were very tender and tasty!!  it's worth the drive and experience.\n\non the flip side, i did feel the dishes were a bit pricey for what they were.  however, i realize peruvian food is hard to come by here....  thus, rarity comes with a price."
38148,3,I am a huge fan of Re Salon & Med Spa! \n\nEveryone that works at the salon is amazing - all the special attention you receive definitely makes for a great experience. I have been going to the salon for 6 months now and have had multiple visits - everything from cut & color to mani/pedi. \n\nIf you are looking for someone who is magic with color & cut you have to see Bethany - she is definitely one of the best!
19467,3,"While the food is good/great- I can't for the life of me figure out who designed their kids menu ( which isn't even posted on the wall BTW)! The options for bread are 9 grain and sourdough- my kids always eat whole wheat at home so 9 grain was ok- although the crust was really well- crusty- and then the worst part is that they use spicy brown mustard on a kids ham and cheese! At first I thought my daughter was being dramatic and then I tried it- seriously, how is that at all kid friendly?! Plus the parking lot is ridiculous - prob the worst parking lot I've dealt with since being in San Francisco!"
15702,2,"Great park. I just moved to the area from Old Town Scottsdale and was delighted when I was told about this park. People are super friendly and way more down to earth than those who frequent Chaparral Dog Park. I have a husky mix who loves this park and all the friends she makes whenever we come :-)\n\nPS: If you meet a nice older gentleman named Kirke who asks to photograph you and your dog, your picture will go here: http://thepacknews.webs.com/ to his super cute dog park website!!!"
9627,1,"First off, I should comment that my husband made a reservation for the wrong restaurant and at 7 pm on a Friday night, we got right in.\n\nOther than that, my experience was less than gratifying.\n\nThe calamari fritti was good, sauce was pretty good.\n\nI was pretty upset to find that the menu on the website is not even a representation of the menu provided in the restaurant. The website says copyright 2012, but Ferraro's does NOT serve Eggplant Parmigiana as stated on their website, nor is their Chicken Parmigiana $20. It was $24.  Also, I've NEVER been to an ITALIAN restaurant that serves broccoli, carrots and POTATOES (potatoes!? seriously?!) with ANYTHING in marinara sauce. Especially since the menu both on the website and IN THE RESTAURANT says \""served with pasta.\""\n\nNOT IMPRESSED. Still searching for a REAL ITALIAN restaurant outside of NY."
20948,1,"When I booked the Thanksgiving buffet, I did not have high expectations for the food.  I read the Yelp reviews and assumed the food would be acceptable.  Unfortunately, even that expectation was not achieved.\n\nI wanted a place that served a fairly traditional meal (which unfortunately left out most of the fine dining takes on Thanksgiving) without waiting in line at one of the mega buffets.  Other than the Italian cured meats and bread, the food was poor.  The carved turkey and pork were dry and lacked any flavor.  The yams were terrible.  The Italian entr\u00e9es were ok, but nothing special.\n\nIn all, my worst meal in Vegas."
26449,0,"Unhappy, Unsatisfied with service, first of all I called for an appointment, they gave me the wrong address, took me 15 minutes more to get there to my appointment at 4... It was 4:15, then I get to the massage room take out my clothes and sign up the sheet, that took me another 7 minutes, it was already 4:22, the massage therapist finished at 4:55 not even THE HOUR that I paid, and then they charge me 49 dollars for the service !!!!! That's a rip off!!!! I tell the lady about the timing and she only replies, the time starts from the time of your appointment, what if they gave me the wrong address took me more time to get there and they I end up getting an awful service paying a ton of money..... It's absurd, I would not recommend this place to anyone, if you want a massage, go to Nevada School of therapy they have decent prices 32 per person and sometimes in the weekends, if you go with one more person is 16 dollars each ! And hey !!! The time starts when you are undressed and in the bed ready for massage. It's a whole hour !!!!"
35520,3,"Feeling a little home sick for Hawaii, I decided to dine with my hubby at L & L located at the centennial shopping center. As we walked in, the smells of teri chicken took me back.  They had music in the background , which was Keahiwai singing Push.\n\nThen, the Hawaii themed counter hits ya with all the local fav combos on the menu.  The Korean lady cashier was very friendly and quickly took our order.  \n\nBefore we knew it we had our plate dinners.  I ordered the Kalua pork with cabbage and teri beef and my hubby ordered the curry chicken katsu.  For dine-in guests, there is refill drinks.  The combos came with, one scoop rice and mac salad.  The mac salad was in a small plastic container, not like in Hawaii, which is placed next to the rice.\n\nMy combo was tasty, but the strips of meat were too big, and the cabbage was not sliced thin enough.  My hubby's combo was tasty too. The curry chicken katsu had a good tang and too spicy.  The portions of food were plenty in both combo plates.  I tried their  and it was kimchee good but the cabbage slices were too big. \n\nIt was nice having familiar food like on the islands.  Overall all, I liked the food and the prices.  I would definitely return to this location for a quick bite."
28533,3,"So my review is inflated because I didn't go at night.  I took my little brother here during the day on a Sunday.  The place was dead, so we were able to get a lane easily of course.  I thought $35 an hour was pretty steep, but with 4 people it turned out to be a deal.  \n\nWe didn't order any food so I can't really say much about that, but the service was excellent.  We wanted beer but got there at 11:45, so the waitress took our order and by 12:01 we had our beers on the table.  She was also really friendly and gave me a round for free because it was my birthday.  \n\nI would love to come back sometime and experience it at night when I am sure it is way cooler, but then again I probably don't want to have to fight the huge crowds that come.  If I'm ever in the area looking for something to do, I will probably suggest coming here."
22546,4,"This is my second visit and it only gets better. Sit in the bar at the banquet seating with low tables and club chairs. Server recommended a bottle of sake which was perfect with  our small plates. A must try is pork belly toco and scallop toco. Dumplings, small burger, tuna roll all fabulous. We ordered Ikura. Perfect amount of rice, the best i have ever had. The cold rice wine just right. Go for happy hour with a group. Five thumbs up!"

19802,2,"Decent pizza, my husband really enjoyed the wings (Jamaican and Original).  But way too expensive in my opinion, 18 bucks for two little orders of wings alone?  Our bill after the tip came to over 40 bucks for some wings, a smalll pizza and two sodas.  I'd expect that from some strip place, but come on, Henderson?  So unfortunately probably won't be returning too often due to the high prices."

18326,2,"I've had pretty bad experiences going to TAO Nightclub. Reason being that the place likes to pack it all the time with no room to dance and no room to walk around because you're bound to bump into people. TAO Beach was no different. Small pool area and they packed this place also with no room to hang out. Luckily it wasn't a big event here at TAO even though we were on the guest list and had to arrive before 11am in order to get a purple wristband. For what though? Men weren't given free drinks from 1pm - 2pm. Only the women were able to get free drinks. We didn't know and some of us ended up paying and some of us didn't. \n\nHowever, day clubs are usually fun no matter what and even though I came here with low expectations which I'm glad I did, I ended up having a good time here. Music, drinks and people hitting the beach balls at each other made it a good time. Even if the water became cloudy after a while when the pool got packed. Main pool was packed as well as the smaller one towards the back of the area. Locker room proved useful but be sure to chip in with friends to make it worth useful as $20 is too much for one couple. If you didn't reserve to get a chair or a cabana, this is not the place to go to if you want to relax unless you're thinking of just staying in the pool the whole time. Just make sure you get there early to get a spot in the pool. If you don't have space, you're better off going outside of TAO Beach and just relaxing at the bigger pool area outside."
8386,2,"You can always count on the British Open Pub as a great place to watch a sports game--you'll always have a TV available.\n\nMaybe it's because it's sandwiched in the Papago Plaza is not always the most happenin' place.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you shouldn't give this spot a try. It's golf-themed, which is refreshing in a sea of Irish- and football-themed bars, and it has a large menu of both food and drinks. There are also daily specials in the kitchen.\n\nFor my meal, I got a house salad ($5.95) and macaroni and cheese ($3.95), which tasted just fine-nothing phenomenal, but they were pretty good as bar food.\n\nMy pal got the English Style Fish and Chips ($10.95), which came with peas-something I'm not used to seeing on many plates these days (thank gosh, because I hate them), but I guess they made the meal more authentically British.\n\nAnd even though the bar wasn't crowded, the people who were there seemed to be really into watching the game that was on. It's also a family-friendly place, so there were a couple of families in addition to the 20-somethings-which included a big group who brought balloon noisemakers. The spot was proof that your experience is what you make of it, and thankfully for us, it was spirited but not uncomfortably cramped like some of the other places we visited."
13363,3,"Bouchon Bistro, in the Venetian, is Thomas Keller's Las Vegas presence. Judging from the google results and \""Bouchon Las Vegas dress code\"" being a popular suggested search, there's some confusion about this bistro. It's relatively casual, but chic. It's decorated like an old French bistro, and the menu reflects its casual but traditional nature.\n\nHis plate: Steak Frites - pan-seared prime flat iron served with ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel butter and frites\n\nHer plate: Sourdough Waffles - sourdough waffles with bananas, toasted walnuts, maple syrup, & Tahitian vanilla bean butter; cappuccino; mimosa\n\nTo share:  Beignets with chocolate and fruit dipping sauces; side of bacon\n\nThe bread for the table was beautiful and fresh, nice mini leaves of thoroughly authentic and crusty French bread. Our beignets came out hot and fresh, very dense and covered in cinnamon sugar. The dipping sauces were chocolate (that may have had a hint of hazelnut) and strawberry/raspberry.\n\nD's steak was good, though he was disappointed that the fries weren't house-made or more special. My waffles were fantastic - and the combination of the vanilla bean butter and the walnuts were really delicious. The syrup was not really needed at all, but I did appreciate that it was served warm."
564,4,What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:)

27331,2,"Very trendy, upscale, and modern pizza place in the Burgh.  They have wine and beer here, and the Yuengling cans are only a dollar.  I had a taste of the grilled romaine app, which was excellent.  I ordered the prosciutto pizza, which had arugula, parmesan cheese, and prosciutto.  It was great!  However, there definitely has to be some more arugula on that pizza.  I've had it where it was piled 4 inches high, and it tasted amazing.  For people who may have been enticed by ordering the pizza because of the arugula, they surely would have been disappointed.  \n\nI also asked for some ricotta on the pizza, because I was craving it, and I was told by the waitress that they can't change the pizzas.  Now I must say, that is a bit ridiculous.  However, I can understand in some strange way that the chef/owner would not want to spoil his pizza by a bad topping choice by a stupid customer.  Therefore, I asked for it on the side.  The waitress accidentally brought goat cheese instead, but I love goat cheese too, so I applied it at my leisure and it was fantastic!\n\nAdditionally, the dry cured chorizo pizza, was a bit of a loser.  I believe there's a picture of the pizza below.  It comes with miniscule slices of chorizo, that hardly have any flavor, and some what looks like potato chips, and some type of green again without much flavor.  I guess the presentation of the pizza may look nice with such sparse toppings, but when it's called a chorizo pizza, you expect to taste chorizo!  \n\nFurthermore, I have to say that if you order a coke, it will be from the bottle, and they pour it in a glass, but..... you use a metal straw.  Loved this feature!"

6322,2,"I planned an event here with some girlfriends for an early dinner. The place is easy to miss, because it's a small building so if you blink or aren't paying attention you will get lost (trust me...I know). Also, just a head's up with the place being so small parking is a bit of a pain. In fact it's pretty non-existent. There's a few spaces in the front and if you're lucky they have a few in the back...if all those are full....good luck! \n\nThat being said, the menu is pretty simple. I think they are going for down home favorites. There are your staple dishes like meatloaf, burgers, fish and salads. But I just wasn't overly impressed with the menu. I opted for the Veggie Burger and fries. It's your typical Morning Star veggie burger so nothing to be amazed about there and the fries were just okay. \n\nThe service was great but I'm just not sure I'd make it a priority to give them another try. Based on the reviews, their brunch might be worth another visit. We'll see!"
37208,3,I would not normally spend time reviewing a chain restaurant like this but \nI had to after the service I received there this past weekend. My husband and I ordered online before heading over there. We asked for our salsa on the side and were a little bummed when we got there and it was actually on our items. The cashier was very accomodating and quickly had our order remade and gave us a free drink while we waited. He also gave us extra free chips with our remade order. We were very happy with the customer service at this location!
41903,0,"Food is overpriced. Service is awful. They give you two tiny pieces of bread with a sizeable appetizer, but when you ask for more bread, they act like you're robbing them.

48759,1,"This Jamba Juice is located inside the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, NV. It's a good healthy detox option at the airport after guaranteed crazy nights in Vegas, especially since the food choices are few and far between. Nothing wrong with the quality of the smoothies itself. However, I had to lower a star because the prices seem to be ridiculously jacked up - especially the boosts! I noticed at least a $0.63+ increase per boost, as I had JUST had Jamba Juice a few days before in San Diego, CA. Seriously? Not a happy camper."
19072,0,"I saw their TV commercial for sirloin steak and all you can eat shrimp so I had to check it out. When I got there, at lunch time, it was so dark that I couldn't even read the menu. When the waitress came over and asked me if she could bring me anything I said Yes, a flashlight. I tried moving to several different tables where there was enough light to see the menu and finally gave up and left."
7936,2,"My mom and I have gone here for years to celebrate Mother's Day. I want to say I ADORE the atmosphere of Arcadia Farms. I want to live there. However, the last couple times we have gone, the food has been lacking. The chicken sandwich was bland, everything needed salt and the crab and avocado tower was not only bland and flavorless but extremely watery. We didn't finish it. Strawberry shortcake was delicious. We have decided to only go back for the ambiance and will have wine and cheese. Probably won't bother ordering additional food.  I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 due to the atmosphere."
22151,2,"I wanted to see \""O\"" but my boyfriend's lackluster response, made me think that LOVE would be a better compromise, considering the Beetles theme. I'd seen Varekai at Marymoor Park in the Seattle area before, so I knew what we were in for and I was pretty excited. \n\nThe show was cool, but is definitely more musical production style than traditional cirque du soleil style. The soundtrack is amazing of course! I think I was just looking forward to more acrobatics than dancing, so I was a little let down. So, yes, it's good, but if you like the bendy wendy types that are normally in these performances, LOVE may not be your best choice."

41648,3,"A great dim sum place near the strip at the Rio.  You can get here from the strip from the free shuttle bus from Bally's or simply take a cab.  Brightly lit, clean interior with great service too.  In my opinion the dim sum here rivals those of Seattle and San Francisco Chinatowns.  Even the tea (goke fah or chrysanthemum) was fragrant  and high quality.  Our total bill before tip came to about 70 for seven people, and we ordered lots.\n\nSome standout items included curry fish balls, sticky chicken rice, beef balls, Siu Mai, black bean spareribs, and fried bean curd filled with shrimp.  All of these items had just enough salt and weren't too oil - in fact all still had good texture.\n\nA minor miss is the beef chow fun.  Beef was seasoned well and there was plenty of \""wok breath\"", but the chefs here sliced up the rice noodles.  Most of our group were used to llonger wide noodles, and I tend to agree - it would make the dish better.  Imagine eating pasta with spaghetti sliced up and you'll notice the difference!\n\nStill, extremely good quality to price ratio and authentic dim sum.  Service was great and the food does come out fast!"
24330,3,"We got into the place for less than it would cost to stay at the RIO.   It was much nicer too.  There were 6 of us (2 adults and 4 small kids).  We got 2 rooms and once there we upgraded for 50 bucks more.   We ended up with1800 square feet, 2 full kitchens (state of the art), floor to ceiling windows with great views....\n\nPros:\nClean, up-to-date features and amenities, great staff, comfy beds\n\nCons:\nBoth rooms were missing items (remotes, dish towels, glasses).  2 phones in one of the rooms only worked on speakerphone.  Some things were falling apart (strips around shower to keep water in) and beautiful jacuzzi tub did not work.  The did player was missing the cables so it didn't work for the kids the first night.\n\nWe brought up the issues to the manager and she waived the resort fees.  All in all was a great experience and we will return!"
27034,1,"Drinking on Lothian Road is usually divided into 2 distinct sets of clientele - the stag party groups that frequent the seemingly endless stream of \""gentleman's clubs\"" along here, or the real ale drinkers who bar hop from Bennet's to The Cloisters and then work their way up towards Princes Street. And whilst, just for the record, I fall into neither of those categories, my flatmate loves a good real ale pub and so I've been dragged along here on a handful of occasions.\n\nIt's an ok pub, albeit a bit on the small and pokey side, and the construction works going on outside seem as if they're never going to end - this really doesn't add much to the atmosphere of the place. I think before the smoking ban came in this place would have been much more buzzing and vibrant, but now it just seems a bit redundant and boring. If you're going to a show or a gig at the adjacent Usher Hall, it's an ok place to pop in for a drink beforehand. Otherwise, you probably woldn't go out of your way to come here."
48341,2,"I love hot dogs so when I noticed this spot for a quick bite in the alley next to Q outside Flamingo I went for it. Food is pricey in Vegas so a quick bite was a nice change from the LONG lines for $$$ everywhere. No wait. I'm in! Great onion rings, Chicago dog was good, bun was a bit crusty, toppings good, but the Detroit Coney looked amazing. Guy next to me got his after I ordered. \nNoticed a lot of local employees popping in to grab a bite at the counter. Always a good idea to follow the locals and I was not disappointed."

22325,0,"I hate giving 1 or 5 star reviews because it often seems like the reviewer has some sort of agenda or is unreasonable. This place though is well deserving of a 1 star. We came here due a groupon that offered \""VIP all you can drink\"" for x dollars for the nighttime. Nothing about what we saw was VIP. When we get there the place was dead, upon entering it was like a western film when they show tumbleweed blowing by.\n\n Later on it did get busier though. This was very frustrating because they had only two bartenders and had a \""strict policy\"" on one drink person despite everyone being all you can drink within the place (part of their normal promotion). I put their strict policy in quotations because it only applied to people the bartenders weren't friends with. We later saw a guy give some multi stage handshake with a guest and he walked away quad fisting drinks. We asked the bartender about this and he said that he \""saw him earlier with 3 other people \"" and that he wasn't given double drinks. \n\nLong story short. Stay away from this place in LV. There are so many good places to go to to waste your time on this shit hole."
28178,0,"While it was Okay, the problems were bad service, the Panang Chicken curry was good, but we paid $5 for a small cup of rice which was barely full, and not enough for even 1/3rd of the Panang chicken.  They wanted us to pay another $5 for more rice, which is ridiculous--they should at least give enough rice to match the entree you buy, if they don't want to refill a side-dish, then at least make the initial helping not the meagre amount they gave out.  Additionally, the pot stickers were likely pre-made, nuked in a microwave and then lightly fried in a pan.  Really not good pot stickers.   You will have better asian food at Panda Express, sorry.  For the atmosphere and money, we were expecting a LOT more than what we got, and we left feeling used."

17916,2,"Dropped into S&W at about 11:15PM on a Saturday night. The place was nearly dead. Got seated quickly, but didn't get a waiter for probably five minutes. Food was meh- my medium-rare, bone-in ribeye was ~$50, but not tender in the least. Was it actually prime beef? Couldn't tell. Mushrooms and whipped potatoes were good. Fries were average. Was looking forward to a really terrific steakhouse meal, but didn't get it."

42624,2,"This place definitely had a sophisticated feel to it. I definitely was disappointed by the long amount of time it took for us to even get service. However, the bartender was at least friendly and the popcorn was fairly good, if not a little stale. \n\nI ordered a Tavern Burger which cost $12. The burger was alright; I always feel a bit jipped when a restaurant burger doesn't include tomatoes in it. It didn't help that they couldn't make two alcoholic beverages that my friend and I asked for. All in all, the hike up in the prices is paying for the atmosphere for the establishment."
37786,1,"I don't understand why everyone is so positive about this buffet. We've eaten at the wicked spoon with the 6 of us today and all of us think that this is one of the worst buffets in Vegas.\nThe quality and choice of dishes does not meet up to the high price of this buffet.\nThe salmon was far from well cooked and had been on the warm plate much to long, so was the shrimp. \nThe carvery was pretty much the same as most low budget buffets and there was no steak or lamb chops or something like that which I think you may expect for the price they charge.\nAlso meat and fish stand right next to eachother which ruins the meat for people who don't like or can't eat seafood. \nI will never visit this buffet again, I'll go to Spice Market at PH or the buffet at MGM instead."
25734,2,Do NOT be in a hurry!  This place is crazy busy and traffic in the store is made worse by all the rubbernecking shoppers. They appease you with a good sized hot dog that costs only a buck and a half.  It's like a north American version of Ikea.
44500,2,"I'm borderline between giving 2 - 3 stars. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and round up to 3 stars because the service can vary every visit. \nThe food overall was average if not a little overpriced. The restaurant has overall very hip feel and their menu has some nice health conscious choices too which I did like.\n\nFree range chicken power grain \""salad\""- basically a salad of lentils and quinoa mixed with some nuts and berries. I liked this a lot. It was very filling and more healthy however the dish lacked seasoning. Maybe using a little citrus vinaigrette could have brighten the dish a lot. The chicken also was basically a plain grilled breast which also had no flavor. Adding a seasoning rub wouldn't hurt.\n\nCubano sandwich- this was a nice sandwich. The bread was soft however the filling was a little sparse. Claims that the dish came with \""French fries\"" but these were basically potato chips. They were nice and very crispy, but not French fries.\n\nBread pudding- this was a decent dessert. Very thick and rich. I love the sauce which had a hint of alcohol in it. Very comforting. \n\n(I will rant about the Service- normally I don't comment on service, but this was the worst service I've had in a very long time. We were seated and 10 mins passed before anyone came to the table to even offer us drinks. This was at 2pm- so not during a rush lunch hour. Supposedly our waiter was backed up so the manager had to come and take our orders. Then after we placed our orders, another 5 mins passed where we never got our water cups filled and we didn't get any of the starter bread crisps that were on everyone else's table. I had to flag a random bus boy down to give us some water. Then after another 10mins a different worker came and gave us our entrees and just left without letting us ask for refills. No one gave us utensils so we sat there for several more mins before I could flag someone down for utensils. Just horrible.)"
20692,1,"How you like this hotel, depends on what part of the building you stay on. If you stay on the strip side I rate this place a 4 star Hotel. However, if you stay on the train track side, yes TRAIN TRACK side I rate this place 2 stars. \n\nThe first night I was on the train track side, meaning the tracks are visible within 40 feet of the hotel. Yes, what a dumbass Trump is for picking such a location, or at least not equipting it with sound proof windows. I heard the horn every hour or therabouts and could not sleep. The following morning I complained and received an upgrade to the strip side, and it was fabulous. Very spacious rooms, extra large bathroom, with walk in shower. The best thing about the hotel is the fact that it is smoke free. \n\nBut the train track side is an unbelievable oversight!"
19543,4,I dig this place. They give you a decent sized salad and these dangerous fried chips with a sweet sauce I pretty much drown anything I order in. The prices are great and they give you a decent amount of food. I don't go for the atmosphere because there really isn't one but the prices are cheap the food is good and the service is quick. They get a thumbs up.
2202,3,"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  My family and I have been eating at Carolina's for about 12 years now.  It is truly delicious mexican food.  They have the best beans, tortillas and enchilada sauce in town!  I cannot get enough of their food.  My favorite meal is a bean & cheese burrito enchilda style with a butter tortilla on the side.  Try it, I promise you will thank me.  \n\nThis place is streaming with professional business people, police officers, firemen, construction workers and everyone in between.  The line is sometimes out the door on weekday lunch hour.  It is actually better to pre-call your order in, although the pick-up line can also pretty long at the lunch hour.  \n\nThe only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars is due to the location and building's interior/exterior.  It is in a pretty poor neighborhood in a crumbling building.  But hey...maybe that add's to the authentic appeal?  Another Carolina's recently opened up on Cactus & Cave Creek, same food but much nicer location.  \n\nAs an addendum to this review the food is definitely 5 stars - it is that good!  Try it!"
46200,3,"Burmese cuisine is a rarity around here, so the recent opening of this restaurant (April) is a welcome addition to Montreal's culinary scene. I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and while the place was busy, we were still able to get  table at the back. I found the restaurant to be bright and very clean, and the tables spread out enough such that you don't end up eyeballing your neighbor's dishes. What can I say? I like my personal space!\n\nWith so many delicious items on the menu, it was tough to make a decision, but I finally went with the Northern Lights salad, which consists of 24 ingredients. Did I remember to write down those ingredients? No I did not - but I can tell you that there are four types of noodles and papaya in there. This dish was served at room temperature, which was perfect given the crazy heat wave we've been having lately. You have the option of adding meat (chicken, pork or beef) and making the dish as spicy as you like it - just let the waiter know. I really enjoyed the dish - it was very flavorful and the right level of spice for me.  Can't wait to go back and try the infamous tea leaf salad!\n\nOne thing to mention - the portions are huge so you might want to consider sharing, unless you've got a very large appetite! Considering the very reasonable prices, you are definitely getting your money's worth at this place. My only 'complaint' was that the service was a little slow - but I wasn't in a hurry so no big deal."
34047,0,"I had an appointment at 11 am and it is now 12:30pm and I still have not been seen. Why make an appointment if you still have to wait this long? I'm a healthy adult in my 20s and just need a shot, didn't think it would take this long. I wanted to come here because I am Vietnamese and wanted to have a Vietnamese doctor to feel more comfortable. This has not been enjoyable. Waiting and waiting. I respect your time by coming early to my appointment, I expect my time to be respected too... Whether it's a Saturday and I'm not working or not. Will probably be changing my PCP. :-("
3003,1,"This is a standard looking hole-in-the-wall Mexican food restaurant just like a gazillion others in Phx.  Unfortunately this one is pretty lame.  \n\nI got two enchiladas, one chicken and one beef.  Neither meat is anything I'd recommend or buy again.    The dark brown sauce scared me and didn't taste much better than it looked.  Some sort of beef sauce I think.  It wasn't awful but it was nothing I want again. My copilot on this adventure said her chicken tacos were not so good either, and when we got back to the office she noted that we won't be trying that place again.\n\nThe place was super quiet for a Friday at 12:30pm. Punch machines were off, a 4yr old was scootering around behind the counter, and I think there were only two people working.  I wonder if they'll be in business next week."
4654,0,"I have been taking my boys to DVP since 2002 and have never had an issue with any Dr's there.

28447,4,"This Pita Jungle is definitely most intimate location of theirs I have visited. It has the typical Pita Jungle feel with brick walls covered in local art, high ceilings, a cool metal tree sculpture and candlelit tables.\n\nThe lobby is a tad cramped when it gets busy, but there is adequate seating and the wait isn't too crazy. After you're seating you'll find the staff to be attentive, filling your glass before it's empty and making sure you're enjoying your meal.\n\nThe food is, as one can expect from the Pita Jungle establishments, always fresh tasting and full of flavor. From their delicious wood fired pizzas, large pitas and salads, you really can't go wrong here. They also have a nice selection of wines, which are usually pretty good.\n\nOverall, I've always had a nice evening here, leaving satisfied and filled, without too light of a wallet."
8173,3,"Our first time here after a long but great day at the ball park.  A little bit of a wait since the patio was closed for a private party.  Totally worth the wait.  We were seated in the bar area and were warned it would be tight.  Chips and not-salsa-but sauce were darn good.  Margaritas awfully tasty.  He had the #5 3 shredded beef enchiladas and I had the #26 3 fish enchiladas. Very, very good.  We liked it not just for what it is but also because of what it isn't.  Is great food with authentic taste; isn't food slathered in sauce & cheese."
16574,1,"After hearing good things about this place, I finally made it here for lunch.  Unfortunately, it was after the menu change so I was expecting different choices.\n\nUpon entering, the first thing I noticed was that there wasn't much space to sit.  There were maybe 5 small tables near the ordering counter and just as much at the patio.  This was a fast casual place(you order at the counter but they'll bring food out to you).  The menu was somewhat small.  You get to pick between pizza, salad, or sandwich.  I decided on a gyro and my bf got the corn pizza.  Since we wanted to sit inside, we decided to go past the ordering counter to see if there were any tables there.  I was skeptical since all I could see was the kitchen and waitstaff in that area, but it turned out there was a ton of restaurant seating that you can't see when you go in.  We weren't sure if we were suppose to sit there since it looked more formal, but we did anyway.  The food came within a reasonable amount of time and it was decent.  My gyro was generously portioned.  The pickle that came with my gyro could have been more crisp and the tzatziki sauce was pretty bland.  The corn pizza was also a generous portion and seemed quite good from the bite I got.\n\nMy main dislike of this place was the layout.  Seating shouldn't be hidden in the back.  The food is slightly pricey and none of the menu items jumped out at me.  I'd describe this place as underwhelming.  At least this place has underground parking."
43741,1,"I avoid Panda Express. In the past, I've had vegetables that are mush and have felt sick to my stomach. However, with our kitchen being worked on, this was one of the few options for a healthier lunch. I had not eaten from the Buckeye location before.\n\nThe good: I had the vegetables instead of noodles/rice, and they were actually very fresh and crisp. I was pleased. Nor did I feel sick afterward.\n\nThe meh: I had chicken and mushrooms, and the Shanghai Angus steak. They were okay. The flavors are so strong they make the meat and vegetables all taste the same. It was all quite edible, but I can cook better at home and for a whole lot cheaper.\n\nAn acceptable place out of desperation, but hey, I've had worse."
31450,1,"We stopped into this location for an early breakfast one morning. The restaurant seemed clean but didn't have many customers. It was us, along about 5 or 6 other tables so I know they weren't too busy to provide basic service!\n\nThe service started out fast - the waiter took our order and delivered our drinks in about 5 mins. Of course he never returned to fill our drinks during the entire meal, all while refilling the drinks of the table next to us 3 times! \n\nWhen he delivered our food, he got half of it correct. Instead of blueberry pancakes, he brought banana pecan ones. He didn't bring any toast and delivered fried eggs instead of scrambled. The worst part was that he never returned to ask how our food was (the food he correctly delivered was pretty good).\n\nThe highlight of the meal was that we got to watch the table next to us (with 3 girls) get top notch service!"
42521,4,Wow! Stumbled on this gem. AMAZING calzone and spaghetti. Can't wait to make the trek from the far northwest to eat here again!!! Wishing we lived closer to become a regular (they seem to have a lot of them). If you're near here and want a great meal for a great deal from some great people...go to Bistro Pizza!!! Yum yum!!!
23097,2,"The service is fine, better to go in during happy hour.... N don't miss their seafood undo pasta, yum"
49356,0,"I feel bad giving this place one star, especially when so many people liked it.  First of all, I asked the person if it would be scary and she said no, it would not be.  Well that is fine and dandy until they put me into a dark room and then at one point something literally fell on top of me (as part of the game).  That scared the poop out of me!\n\nAlso, I thought that it would be more problem solving, but it was just a series of locks that led to keys that led to more locks and the only thing you had to figure out was what numbers to use.  We had trouble getting the right numbers lined up because each lock was different and it was hard to see with the flashlights.  Stupid obstacles like that took the fun out of actually \""solving\"" the riddle."
37207,4,"I am writing a review of Mansions as a music venue.  This is a unique location to dine and listen to live music.  Because it's a small hotel, the staff is very attentive to the smallest needs and is very willing to help.  It's fun just to look around the place.  The acoustics are wonderful for live music, there's a lot of beautiful woodwork, and so the sound is live and warm.  I have eaten at the brunch and the food was wonderful, lots of choices from a buffet, and top quality and well prepared food.    Definitely worth visiting.  I will come back often."
10367,2,"The most awesome thing about this Fatburger is that they open 24 hours. We got hungry once at 2:30 am and decided to walk there. My 1st experience there's funny. When I walked in, I was greeted with non-stop rap songs. Also, there are so many ghetto people in there too, all shady looking. I thought we're gonna get robbed, shot or something lol.\n\nThe burger itself is really greasy. You can order the size you want (from S - XXXL) and can pay extra for additional cool toppings, such as chilli and fried egg (I'd recommend these). The burger comes with mustard, mayo, relish, shredded lettuce & tomatoes. The burger as a whole's pretty good. I like the toppings that they put in there.\n\nConclusion: The burger's pretty good. About the same with 5 guys, but definitely can't beat In-N-Out."
2152,0,"Visited Coco's on a Monday afternoon (parking lot was \""unusually\"" sparse.. counted 3 cars total.  Seating was quick, order was taken quickly, salads were delivered quickly.

My stomach felt upset for about an hour afterwards.. Service was A-ok, waitress had to be reminded to refill the tea, didn't take up completed dishes (manager took some of the dishes and said he be right back to pick up the rest  - - didn't happen.

25667,3,"Barcelos combo table d'hote portions are very filling and customers leave satisfied. \n\nI ate the chicken leg and lamb chop combo and found them both to be packed with taste but a little on the dry side.

31367,0,"A great downtown location, an appropriately-sized setup in a beautiful building, a clean, modern aesthetic. \n\nGiant was obviously well-funded.

40386,4,"Kathleen and her place is great!  She is a seasoned esthetician who has been providing skin care for many years.  Safety and comfort are at the top of her list.  She takes pride in the outcome of her work!  \n\nI was a bit skeptical going into to Kiss to get eyelash extensions. It was something I had never even thought of doing.  But, I want to look bright eyed when I wake up in the morning, and these extensions have done just that for me!  I dont have to wear mascara at all anymore! \n\nI was worried that the extensions would be painful or uncomfortable, however they are not at all.  In fact when they were put on, I couldn't feel anything different about my eye, even when I blinked.  Boy do my eye lashes look different though!  Beautiful.  And not at all fake or false looking.  Even my friends cant tell.  \n\nI would highly recommend Kathleen for lashes and I would highly recommend lash extensions for any no nonsense girls who dont want to deal with mascara every day!."
44528,1,"Not impressed. I was with a large group, so that might have been that. I was late and everyone else had already ordered. The server acknowledged me as the straggler or so I thought. I asked for a drink menu and a regular menu and he gave me the drink menu and he came back to the other end of the table a couple times leaving me still drink-less. After that he didn't ask about food and one of the guys in my party went up to him to tell him I was still looking to order. Everyone else received their food before I even ordered. I should have just given up right there, but I was starving. I ordered the apocalypse sow with salad. Not as good as I expected. I felt it was dry and lacking flavor. The aoli was just plopped in the middle. The meat was crumbling and I had to just eat it with a knife and fork. Should have just got the soup."
49282,1,"I've been going to Cafe Rio for over 15 years. Since moving to Arizona from Cali we were pretty excited to be close to the  one on Baseline which is about 15-20 min from where we live but that made no difference because we loved Cafe Rio in the past. That location was average, always out of ice and always trying to rush you through the line. The food pretty good which kept us going back.\nWhen the San Tan location opened we were pretty excited because of its proximity. In the last year we've probably been 10-15 times to Baseline and this location 4 times. The other night we went and they were super chinsy on the meat we ordered 5 meals and each meal hardly had meat. Feels like Cafe Rio has gone down hill since franchising which is to be expected, but the prices continue to get higher. Get your act together Cafe Rio."
23522,0,"Took an hour for our food to get to our table and by that time we needed to get it to go. I got the grilled chicken salad and it was horrible. Our waitress, in the full hour we were there, only came to our table 3 times. Drink order and food order (at the same time), to tell us our food was almost ready (a half hour after she took our order), then a half hour later to give us our check because she had someone else bring our food. And no they were not busy in the least but fully staffed. It was ridiculous."
2803,2,"I was looking for something to do with the in laws and this seemed right up their alley. It's a tourist trap, lots of  touristy stuff for sale and everything costs extra money. It was neat to see, got great pics and the history was great. Won't go again, once was enough but it was something to experience and glad I did."
43390,3,"First I'd like to say that I love reading the reviews where dudes say \""there just aren't enough options for free weights for me\"" or \""can't do heavy lifting here\"". Lol. I challenge them to use the maximum weight of any dumbbells or machines in this gym. If you need more than 75 lb dumbbells, you. are. buffffffffff. and you should probably just start bench pressing cars or something in order to get a good workout.\n\nOk, so I went with this gym because of the price...$29 to start, $10/mo then up to $15/mo after a year. No contract, just $25 to cxl. I have since seen lots of Groupons and deals for it and that kiiiiiiiiiiind of pisses me off every time I see it. The prices are SIGNIFICANTLY lower on those sites and I wish I would've been able to take advantage of that when I joined. You can also do the higher level membership for something like $20/mo and get guest privileges and half price on products like drinks that you can buy. For me...I'd rather bring my own water anyway and since I don't bring anyone with me I don't need the guest privileges. But...it's an option.\n\nI like the cardio equipment, treadmills and arc trainers (kiiiiiind of like an elliptical but with more of a stair climber motion than elliptical has). They all have TVs built in with basic cable to distract you from your boring cardio. Haha. They also have iPod capability where you plug in using their plug (which charges your iPod while you use it) and you can listen to it through the machine using the buttons on the machine to skip, play, control volume, etc...\n\nBecause the equipment is new, I haven't experienced many broken machines like I have at older gyms. I have reported equipment that was malfunctioning in various ways and the employees are always prompt about testing them, putting \""out of order\"" signs on them, and I have never seen something broken for more than a day or two.\n\nThey do have some equipment like medicine balls, kettle weights, and the big inflatable exercise balls. I don't personally use these things, but they ARE available and some people dig them.\n\nThere are no classes or pool, which I never used at other gyms anyway so I'm glad not to have to pay to not use them.\n\nThe employees are...cool for the most part. Most of them are friendly and willing to help you figure out a machine or exercise, spot you, or answer questions about workouts. There are a few rude ones, but I won't be too specific about those for fear that they will read this. Hey, I have to keep going here! :P \n\nThe gym is constantly being cleaned by the employees...vacuuming, wiping things down with spray, and checking and lubing up cables are things that seem to constantly be going on here. I like this a lot. There are also cleaning stations where you can grab your own spray and paper towels to wipe things down if  you wish. They offer hand sanitizer as well, which is nice at a place like a gym where everyone is touching everything.\n\nAs I read as a complaint in another post, they DO ask that you bring a towel. I too think this is a little annoying because I'm not one of those people who sweat all over the damn place, BUT...I get why it's a policy. There are some sweaty ass people at the gym and there's nothing worse than getting on a treadmill with nasty sweat droplets all over it or trying to sit on a weight bench that has someone's ass crack sweat on it. Gross. Just bring the towel people. There's no rule about the towel...it can be a little 2x2 square if you want to be a smart ass, or a beach towel if you like to maybe wear a towel cape while working out.\n\nI've heard of a couple people getting double charged for their memberships, but staff is pretty quick to resolve these issues.\n\nOverall, this is a good gym. It certainly offers enough for anyone to get a decent workout. I guess if you're a professional body builder who needs 1,000 lb machines and 200 lb dumbbells, it's not good enough, but for NORMAL people it's sufficient."
9515,4,"We got married June 14 of this year, I did a lot of searching online at different places, and I am very picky about video/pictures because of my memory loss. I saw a ton of other places that altough they looked nice, they couldn't have better pictures or video than Mon Bel Ami.\n\nCarrie who was my wedding planner, was excellent as she answered every single one of my emails I threw at her. \n\nDave (the photographer) was awesome! He was able to get some really good shots of us and family as well.\n\nWilliam (the minister) took his time, and was not rushed at all, he even helped calm things down before hand. His demeanor was exceptional! \n\nI could have not asked for a better experience, the only thing that kind of got me was, I was rushing around before hand to make sure I made it for the limo, only to get a call that they were having problems with the limo. So we arrived late to my own wedding, I thought I would have to rush to get ready but everyone allowed me to take my time, so that helped calm me down.  The limo driver on the way back to the hotel after the ceremony was not friendly, as he was in a hurry to get somewhere else, and we were not able to ride down the strip again as he took the back way.\n\nAll in all, a good experience, and if I ever renew my vows, I can guarantee, this is where I will do it!!"
29147,2,"Met up with some of the girls for breakfast on Sunday and the place was jumping, as usual.  I want to say, up front, that this place was my absolute favorite for HH a couple of years ago....nice patio, tremendous service, and good wine.  I was there at least once a week with a variety of people BECAUSE of  the extra touches.  My last few experiences have ranged from lackluster to \""meh\"" and I've decided it's because of the service and not the food.  \n\nThis trip was no different...from the hostess who let me stand 2 feet in front of her for about a minute without acknowledging me, to the server who seemed not to feel well and had no real patience for our slowness in ordering.  \n\nIt just looks like this team was not having a good time at work.  There were some notable exceptions; the bartender very pleasant and the young lady who took us to our table was nice as well.  I miss the smiling faces and the energy of folks who enjoy their jobs.\n\nI have no quibbles with the food at all....loves me some tomato jam bruschetta, the salmon plate, pickles, and a range of other tasty treats but brunch is also about ambiance and I expect so much more when I'm spending $100 for a table of four.  \n\nThis neighborhood is filling up with good restaurants and what separates one from the rest is the general comfort and welcoming vibe.  I fervently hope that this location begins to value this very simple concept as the market becomes more competitive.\n\nSo, how does Postino get to that 4th, or even 5th, star??\n\nSay Hi to me when I come in.  Smile at me and say \""Be right with you\"".\nSwing by and ask how my food is.\nDon't tell me you \""have\"" to be here.\n\nI can think of several other things but these are quick and don't cost anything.  Until then Postino, you aren't a destination for me."

FYI--if you are thinking of eating here anywhere close to a normal eating hour, prepare to wait.\n\nAfter reading many Yelp reviews, I decided to go with the Britannia burger and the truffle fries.\n\nThe Britannia burger was decent, though nothing amazing. The meat was seasoned pretty well, but everything else was a bit lackluster. I don't know if it's because I have been in the LA burger scene too long, but I was not impressed.\n\nThe truffle fries were even more disappointing, as they failed to even impart any truffle flavor.\n\nAnother person from my group said that the sweet potato fries were delicious but I did not have an opportunity to try them.\n\nOverall, this place has average burgers, Vegas prices, and a long wait. Might as well skip it and try something else in my opinion."
4643,1,Service was descent but the crab cakes were burnt! This was my first time here and will most likely be the last. The waitress saw that my crab cake was completely black on the bottom. Obviously they put the lesser burnt side facing up hoping that I wouldn't notice. The rest of the food wasn't much better.
38638,3,"Great vibe, great DJ, and most importantly... fast service at the bar!  I kinda liked how it was an intimate size lounge, and I loved the art they had there.  Fun size dance floor with black lights and glow in the dark drawings on the wall.  They were spinning fun 80's music when I went there Saturday.  Very clean facility, and friendly bartenders.  I loved the service there.  It took me 5 minutes to order and get my drink.  Normally I hate how hard it is the get bartender's attention,  but they were very attentive of who walks up (even when it was pretty busy). Drinks were not over priced.   My drink,  which was an extra-dirty martini ($7), was perfect--not too strong and exactly what I wanted.  They also have this yummy beer called \""Snakebite\"" (New Castle and Cider)--i recommend trying it!"
15134,4,"I've eaten here twice, and both times I left here with my taste buds completely satisfied!\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is nice.  It's not overly formal, but not too casual either.  It's also not too noisy so you and your company can definitely have conversations without needing to scream into each other's ears.\n\nThe wine selection is pretty wide.  They are true to their culture and focus mostly on Italian wines, all of which have been delicious, for the ones that I have tried at least. Should definitely check out the sparkling wines or dessert wines if your pocketbook can afford it.  :-)\n\nThe food is nothing short of AMAZING!  Even something as simple as cold cuts and cheese was enough to impress me.  The ingredients are fresh and unique, nothing you'd normally find in a typical grocery market.  I think they marinated the olives and many other foods themselves, so the flavors you're getting from this place is definitely not something you can find just anywhere else!\n\nI tried 2 or 3 different types of pasta from this location and loved each one of them.  The chefs here pair special sauces for different types of pasta, each sauce focusing on the reduction of various alcohols like brandy or vodka.  Anyone can make pasta sauce, but to make it where you can actually taste/feel out all the flavors of the ingredients and appreciate the way it complements the pasta, that is rare.  This place definitely inspired me to experiment and be more creative with my pasta sauces in the future!\n\nI had this a few years ago, so I can't remember how to describe it, but I remember that the calamari was to die for!\n\nThe service was great!  Food came out really fast, and the servers were good about refills and clearing empty plates to make room for the next course.\n\nPricing is a little expensive, but it's also not outrageous.  For the quality and quantity of the food you're getting, I'd say it's fair.  Probably not somewhere you'd want to eat at everyday, but it's definitely affordable for those special dates."

The soy latte cannot be beat...as Jason S. mentioned, they are one of the only places in town that can do a soy latte correctly.\n\nI did notice a sign that their muffins are all $1 and cookies are $1.50 after 4pm - though you have to pay in cash.  This makes me want to go back at 4pm just to get the leftovers...they are amazing! \n\nToday I saw, a true sign of a real coffee shop...two groups of people engaged in conversations about current issues..."
41319,2,"Ordered food togo. Pizza was okay, not great though my daughter liked it. Order not exactly what I ordered, but not bad. Ordered linguini with mussels in red sauce, got just mussels; preferred string green beans with spinach, got soggy spinach with broccoli and cauliflower, no green beans. Calimari was fresh, but not crispy fried-soft. Maybe things were off this night. Will give it another shot. I wanna like it. Hope it is better."
11557,1,"Went for breakfast and wasn't impressed at all.  The people who work at DeLucas are not friendly and have a you should be happy I am serving you attitude.  If you are not a morning person then you shouldn't serve breakfast.  A smile and a good morning goes a long way.\n\nThe food was mediocre, greasy and lacking flavor. I ordered the California Omelette and it was something I could make at home with better flavor.  The chicken in the omelette had no taste and it was overlooked.\n\nOverall, I don't get the hype.  This is similar to a greasy diner.  Pamela's is the place for breakfast."
16045,3,"came here for TIESTO'S concert a week ago...IT. WAS. EXCELLENT!\n\nfirst of all, although the event was sold out, they didn't sell too many tickets, so that the main floor, which was pretty small, never got too crowded and packed. we could dance to our heart's desires without bumping ass with everyone, and we were able to walk and move around freely. the second and third floors were also comfortably full. i was almost jealous that they had seating available. besides the bar in the back there was a random drink station on the main floor near the stage which i kept going back to to get cups of just ice, since WATER WAS $15. \n\nyou don't miss much if you arrive after 11pm because the first opening DJ played extremely mellow music and we were all bored as fuck. no one was dancing. it felt like we were at a cocktail party. \n\nthe second opener (hardwell) started playing more energetic and intense music and got the party started...more people started coming to life but it was still less than half the crowd\n\ntiesto didn't come on until 1am, wearing a small pink t-shirt, but once he did, it was nonstop hard beats, new tracks, old tracks, tracks from his kaleidoscope album, and remixed classics. his set was pure energy and happiness. even up until 5am when i had no energy left he was still bumping intense music. the lights were pretty entertaining, and confetti and streamers periodically rained down from the ceiling...my faaavorite! near the end he played an moving remix of \""forever young\"" that made me want to cry bittersweet tears. fack. \n\nyou can go in and out as long as you present your ticket, and you can bring drinks in. attire varied widely...ranging from shorts and t-shirts, to dresses and heels for girls, to dress shirts and jeans for guys which eventually turned into wifebeaters and jeans...i wore a dress (because vegas is sexy time) and flip flops so my feet wouldn't get destroyed.\n\ntiesto's concert here was SO worth the $50. i loved every second of his set!\n\np.s. my friend lost his ticket before the concert (i have no idea how), and once they saw his utterly devastated expression, the people were nice enough to print him a whole new one for free."
12439,0,"Not impressed at all.... Paris wasn't a horrible stay, but they gave me a bad impression right from the start. We were staying at the Luxor for two nights and Paris for one night. \n\nSo we head over to Paris to check-in and right off the bat we get an \""early check-in\"" fee. They charged $15 to check-in at 2pm versus 3pm. Come on!! Don't they want returning customers? Sorry I don't mean to sound like a cheap ass but when hotels try to squeeze every extra penny out of my pocket, it really ticks me off. \n\nAlso, I get it is supposed to be a french hotel and there is a very obvious french theme throughout the hotel, but I have one piece of advise. GET A STARBUCKS!! Your crappy coffee shop sucks!! Starbucks can run circles around your knock off, and very sloooowwww, coffee shop! I was the only person in line, waited 10 minutes, and didn't even get to order anything. \n\nI will probably never stay here again. Paris is way too overpriced for the level of service and amenities I received."

49593,0,"Five months and a bit I was curious to see if this new Mexican eatery had upped its game. Sadly no.\n\nThe quesadilla, steak, all dressed without lettuce as it would make the quesadilla too soggy, I was told. The counter person a very nice young lady toasted it to perfection. At the table I tried lifting one of the pieces barley making any of it to my anxious tongue. From the counter to my seat it had gone soggy even without the damned lettuce. So with plastic cutlery now in hand and grumpy in charge I ate to stuffed this self deconstructing, moderately flavourful quesadilla.\n\nLike I've said many times, if you're going to do food do it right or not at all. You otherwise embarrass yourself, make a mockery of it origines, disrespect the ethnicity of the people and insult the pallet of those who have refined taste buds and knowledge of various cultures. Oh yes and You embarrass Yourself!\n\nOn the bright side quesadillas were half price. $4,54 tax in and I was not hungry afterward, just wanting real Mexican food."
27096,1,"This is clearly for visitors of the City who don't have time or cannot be bothered to head to Loch Ness itself. Add some 3D and some fairytales (or scientific evidence- whatever way you want to look at it) you get to see hand on evidence around the myths surrounding this loch. Most of the evidence comes from the (slightly derranged) individuals who spent a lot of time looking at the lake. Or devising machines to proove their point. You can proove anything with facts these days. And photos.\n\nAfter your Loch Ness Discovery troop over to the Loch itself if you have time. You are going to spend the first 5-15 minutes starring at it as well, convinced that  that movement in the distance is Nessie herself.

28865,0,"Falls under expectations. Front desk staff is indifferent, feels like I'm at Target. I called in regards to a room change because ours smelled like acidic vinegar, and they said they'll either bring up fans or to come back down. Down we go, to find another huge line. I asked a front desk attendant who I should be talking to, he was rude in telling me the front desk lady I spoke to doesn't exist and he directed me to wait in the corner for his manager. Upon small talk with the manager that the front area is disorganized, he had no comment, just stayed mum. He threw my ID back unto the table and slid it towards me. No one took a moment to apologize for the inconvenience. Upon getting my new room key card, I realized the whole floor smelled like vinegar. Upon entering, the room feels like a Marriott Springfield Suites, you know one of those business extended stays, but no coffee machine :T If you're looking for a no-smoking, no casino hotel, I recommend the Trump, with a great view looking down from the north strip."
14238,2,"The decor in this place is breathtaking (both the interior design and people that adorn the club). I don't know about you, but going to club with this gorgeous waterfall isn't an everyday occurance in my books and it gives the club a nice edge. \n\nThe line getting into this place looked like it would be at least a two hour wait if not longer...if you do have the cash I can highly recommend getting a VIP host for the night. No waiting in line (which looked to be at least a two hour wait) and you'll have someone setting you up with a great time. \n\nThe music was very danceable with a good mix of house, rnb, hip hop and some classic rock mash-ups. The DJ definitely knew how to get the crowd started...\n\nMy personal criticisms of the place are as follows:\n\nSPACE: I am the type of person that goes out to the clubs with the intent of dancing and though this place size wise was huge, by the time it was midnight you had to elbow your way through the club to do any dancing whatsoever. \n\nVIP: We had bottle service there and unfortunately as the area wasn't roped off properly, no room to dance here either. We even moved tables during the night to see whether it made any difference...none unfortunately. \n\nCLUB SIZE: I prefer clubs that at least give the illusion of being a little bit more on the intimate side. Tryst was jam-packed (admittedly beautiful people, but nevertheless) on a Thursday night in a club that could have standed to lose about a fourth to enhance the atmosphere for the rest of the people there."

39676,2,"OK so I was REALLY REALLY looking forward to getting my Lousiana style crawfish / seafood. I've been missing my Boiling Crab in Cali. This was probably the closest I would get, since they don't have it in Chicago. I was a little disappointed by the crawfish, because the shell was super thick and hard, and there was just something a little different about the sauce. I still ate like a beast, don't get me wrong. I mean how can you not be a little messy when you eat with your hands and there's sauce everywhere...but I think I really would have enjoyed it a lot more if the crawfish was like what they give you at Boiling Crab. Maybe they're from a different region? It really makes a difference if their shells are so hard, makes it difficult to peel. And the taste of the crawfish meat was even different! Almost like it was a \""lower grade\"" of seafood meat.\n\nAnyway, we also ordered clams, crab legs, and shrimp. I really enjoyed the crab legs and clams, and the shrimp was pretty good too. We got fries to share, which was a welcomed distraction for our tongues after too much spicy/garlic-y goodness. I loved the corn on the cob, as usual."
36396,2,"I've been to Aldi stores before, back when I used to live in IL, so I was familiar w/ the layout.  If you've never been, it's like a miniature Sam's Club, but with generic-brand products and no membership fees.  \n\nIf you need a cart, you may pick one up at the side of the store by depositing a quarter, which you may then retrieve by returning the cart when you're done w/ it.  There usually is just enough room for two small-sized people walking side-by-side pushing carts one-way, so just keep this in mind as you go through the store and its mazes.  Just because most, if not all of the brands here are generic, it doesn't mean that Aldi doesn't sell quality stuff!  I was pleasantly surprised to find ORGANIC turkeys sold here the day before Thanksgiving.  Too bad all of them were about 12 pounds or larger, or else we'd have bought one to try, and I'd have one more thing to review here...\n\nThe reason I wanted to post something about my Aldi visit was to say that chocolate lovers must, if you haven't already, try a few of the European chocolates sold here!  You may find them among one of the first crates to your left as you enter the store and proceed forward.  Two brands we tried were Choceur [dark choc, milk choc, and milk choc w/ almonds (those w/ a hazelnut allergy would best stay away from the almond bar-- it contains hazelnut paste)] and Moser Roth (chili dark choc).  While the Choceur milk chocolate and almond bar was delicious (not too sweet!), I did feel the room spin as soon as I had a bite (I'm able to eat toasted hazelnuts w/out problems, but hazelnut spreads and chocolate-covered hazelnuts do cause allergy symptoms).  I'm savoring a few pieces of the dark chocolate variety as I type this... Mmm, and it's so melt-in-your-mouth creamy-dreamy!  If you're a bit daring when it comes to mixing chocolate and peppers, then you may like Moser Roth's Chili bar.  I didn't find it as spicy as my baby sis did, but then again, she doesn't really like spicy dishes (she orders a \""1\"" when at a Thai restaurant that serves dishes ranging a mild 1 to an inferno 5), but the flavors harkened to the times when I tried Mexican hot cocoa and churros made w/ Ibarra chocolate....\n\nMy older sister's MIL LOVES the brownie mixes here!  I can't review it, as it contains corn products; However, the aromas that wafted throughout the house while it baked sure smelled delightful!  (The beautiful cracked surface of the brownies also teased me until I finally had to turn away before I gave in.  LOL)"
49817,2,The meat is bbq less. Who wants to add sauce to their own bbq...not me. It was 3 star worthy. The fries & beans were just ok. Will I return maybe.
24457,3,"LVAC on Flamingo .aka. the \""Pretty Gym\"". \n\nMost of the people that work out at this gym are already in shape, I feel so out of place, just like one of the other Yelpers. You have the guys that look like steroid users and then the girls that look like they work at Deja Vu, I don't mean to stereotype but how else are you going to get the picture? I personally don't care, yea, they look good and I need a LOT of work, but seriously, we're all there for the same reason, it's just going to take more time for myself lol oh well! \n\nThe gym and locker rooms are well maintained, the machines don't smell like butt and most times, if a machine needs attention, the people that work out here are pretty good about letting management know. My only gripe is that they need to MOVE THE FOOD STAND ELSE WHERE. Right when you walk in, you smell food, and it smells pretty good. I'm coming here to work off the crap I just ate and now they're tempting me with more crap to eat! Boo! \n\nThere are a variety of amenities that you're able to take advantage of, of course, certain thing may cost a little more but prices are still pretty good compared to other gyms. They have racket ball courts, indoor track, women's workout room, steam room, indoor pool, spin classes, zumba classes, really, a lot of classes. Their classes are pretty cool, you're able to join in any of the classes no matter what level you are, you don't have to wait for an 'advanced' or 'beginners' class, you go in and you go at your own pace. \n\nAnother amenity that's available for parents of young children is that they have a play room where they can watch your kids. I've seen infants in there and I think that the oldest age that you can take there is 12. Monitors are inside the gym, so you're able to check in on them without having to walk all the way over there. \n\nAfter the gym, I like the fact that there's a Tropical Smoothie right across the street and they offer a 10% discount to LVAC members. \n\nI like this gym, just move the food some where else, PLEASE."
38824,0,"Of all the meals I had while here for a week, this was my least favorite. Clearly the food here is good I think that I just ordered the wrong menu item (even though it was a server recommendation.) Salmon portion was generous but mashed potatoes, asparagus and Beurre Blanc did not measure up in the taste category. Friends had wings, chop chop salad and a burger, & sandwich. Lemon Drop was very good but second order had to be returned due to lack of sugared rim. Hey, it's what makes this drink so darn good. Here is the kicker, and it's a good one! In the front of the house they had a threesome playing Irish songs. They were good but it was piped into the dining area and made conversation nigh impossible. I get the check $192.00 for dinner for five, drink for each and they have tacked on $16.00 for live entertainment. I did not say anything, tipped 20% and left feeling ripped off. I have never had this fee added to a dinner check when the \""house\"" is offering live music in another venue. Shame on you for the sneaky move to extract more money from unsuspecting tourists."
40284,1,"On vacation and was looking for some fast Chinese food to take out. Didn't have time yelp.. But, ended up here. I wish I did yelp before heading inside here. \n\nWas greeted by a 12 year old boy playing his gameboy or something like that? Then, we approach the counter for a menu and were greeted by a not so friendly 20 year girl. Probably the owners daughter? \n\nI place my order for 6 people.. And spent about $60 worth of food! Then, I saw a coupon for free sesame chicken if you spent more then $50 dollars. Bought it to the girl attention and she got a bit rude. \n\nThe food wasn't all that. It was a bit bland. I wish it was more authentic, and not so chewy. They provide you with a lot of meat.. But, not enough rice for 6 people, a tiny portion! The inside of the restaurant was a bit clean and it was empty? Who knows? But, the reviews on here are definitely true. \n\nFood- 2 out 5 \nService- 1 out 5\nCleanliness- 3 out of 5"

40433,0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. We gave this place a chance after reading a write up in the Henderson Home News. Anxious to support locally owned businesses in our area we completely ignored previous poor reviews in hopes of finding a gold mine.  \nIt was the day after Christmas and many local restaurants were closed so we called AND called their listed phone and only received voicemail. Nothing indicated that they were closed so we drive over there to find them open and empty, (a potentially ominous sign).  Turns out, as explained by the girl at the register, the staff isn't allowed to answer \""that\"" phone.  Really???  \nWe were greeted promptly.  The menu is extremely limited, but does boast freshly ground angus burgers, fries and shakes. There were six in our party. We ordered everything from a regular burger, cheeseburger, a couple of PCH's & a pastrami sandwich on rye, along with several orders of \""fresh\"" fries and a couple of shakes. \nThe food took forever, 30 minutes, which as indicated by the posted sign, should be expected, as everything is made FRESH. However, when our food did arrive it was clear immediately that it was NOT fresh. All of the burgers were a pale grey color, certainly NOT freshly ground or grilled. The fries appeared promising, but they too were a false rendition of fresh. They were cold and hard, just as another reviewer said, I've had better come out of my fridge as leftovers. Two of our PCH burgers got messed up, sauce one the one that wasn't supposed to have it, Swiss instead of American, onions, missing bacon, the list goes on. When we brought this to the staff's attention she told us to switch buns and the problem would be miraculously   solved. Huh??? \n She eventually, begrudgingly agreed to remake only one of the burgers and not the other one. Odd. \nWhile waiting another agonizing 20 minutes, the replacement burger arrived. Mediocre at best. At some point, we were told there was no rye bread for the pastrami sandwich. No big shakes it happens. The hoagie roll was fresh, but the pastrami was cold, dry and rubbery with an very generous slathering of mayo. The shakes were freshly made. There were two staff members on duty. The girl at the register was not very efficient as it was her first day, but the tried to be polite. The other kid operating the grill seemed to be more senior and he was polite, too. But no amount of apologies could make the food taste better.  I had really high hopes for this place, hopefully the ownership can turn things around."
20760,3,Yay! Sephora is finally here!! This is the only reason I decided to return to JcPenney. I was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales. In fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance. I may actually start shopping here again.
17684,4,"My most recent visit here was quickly headed into the 2-3 star category, but thankfully turned into a positive one.  The restaurant was only half full, and granted we had a party of 12 show up at 7pm on a Monday night, they told us it would be 45-50 minutes of waiting for a table.  We even offered to be split into two adjacent tables, and still, the hostess was convinced it would still take nearly an hour.\n\nSo, we contemplated getting takeout, and were about ready to order when miraculously *poof* a table opened up.  The service was excellent, and the Big Beef Sandwich was great!  Good food, decent atmosphere, although the \""Legalize Marinara\"" T-shirts are a little over the top, especially in a heavy conservative part of town.\n\nAnyway, I'll be back.  The unique and tasty dishes will ensure that."
19466,0,"I have going there at least 1 per week and have been the biggest fan!\n\nHOWEVER\n\nTheir quality has been going DOWN DRAMATICALLY. I ordered the same salad 4 times in a row, which is  my favorite on their menu. EACH TIME, it was missing a new element, either they did not put any cheese in it, or put half of the bread it's supposed to come with, or lacking some of the veggies.\n\nTheir portions have gone smaller.\nIt's unfortunate that to save money they are trying to rip off people by small changes that are supposed to go unnoticeable, such as repetitively not putting cheese, which is the most expensive part of the salad, and not telling their clients. \n\nThey also have advertised a vegetarian chili which had full chunks of chicken in it.\n\nI am SO DISAPPOINTED that my favorite eating place in town is becoming one that I would not recommend to anyone."
38608,0,"So I decided to venture out around my neighborhood and found this place. Here is my review: Upon entry I knew this would be an odd experience. It looked more like a smoothie place versus a Thai food restaurant. Other than not having proper Thai spices (think fish oil, chilies, etc..) the pad Thai was sub-par at best! My boy got the sweet and sour chicken and was not to happy with the familiar taste of mediocre food! This was a huge disappointment. The Thai Ice Coffee wasn't too good either. And to think about it, the Thai iced tea kinda sucked as well. Over all this was a fake Thai food joint. I will NEVER return to this establishment."
27615,2,"The only thing I would add to the many reviews is that I recommend you study the menu on the restaurant's website prior to going so you understand that this menu is limited and different.  Our group of three had some difficulty figuring out what to order.  I think the idea here is for you to order as a group and share, which can be fun, if you are in to that.  \n\nWe didn't like the Mac and Cheese with lobster very much.  It's a different twist on this old standby.  We were surprised at the very little piece of lobster you get for an extra $4.  It's not worth the extra money.\n\nOther than these quibbles it was good food and a nice, but small place.\n\nThey only take reservations for groups of six or more."
6724,4,"I loved this place.  Our son, Andrew, and girlfriend, Sara, took us here to enjoy a wonderful breakfast on our recent trip to Wisconsin.... Everything they had here was delicious and I hope to get a chance to go back some day.  It was definitely worth the wait to get in.  I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now."

29528,1,"My wife and I are of the BBQ loving variety, and we're also the kind that believes it's difficult to do EVERYTHING well. Every place has it's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFirst, the strengths:\n- Green Chile Mac is very, very good. We both liked it, and it's gotta a little kick, and a GREAT flavor. Love it!\n- Baked potato salad: I need a carton of this in my fridge at all times. My wife is a potato salad snob, and she loves this stuff, as do I. It's nothing short of amazing..possibly the best I've ever tried from a restaurant.\n- Ribs--tangy and good! We've done ribs before, and they're not easy, but these are super yummy! Not too dry, and very good flavor!\n- The \""Original\"" BBQ sauce is on the sweet side and is very good, and the spicy sauce is also great! I'd love to do a BBQ with either of these!\n\nThe weaknesses:\n- Coleslaw. Ouch. I think Raising Cain's has better slaw...cold and crisp but very little flavor.\n- Chicken. Oh this one hurt. I think I've made better BBQ chicken...it just didn't have much flavor!\n\nThe Average: \n- Brisket. It's ok. Mine was moist and juicy, but the flavor didn't knock my socks off. Given that we paid $30 for the both of us, I was really hoping it would blow me away.\nIt's not that it was bad! It's just... well, I'd rather have Rudy's Brisket. I also felt like half of my 1/2 pound sandwich was fat...and brisket is a pretty fatty cut so that's not completely unexpected.\n- Pulled pork. The pulled pork WAS better than the brisket but still not much to write home about.\n\nWe both felt like the strength of the BBQ sauce was there to cover up the meat... and that's kind of a backwards way to do it. But everyone has they're own style. For us, I think we'll say we tried it and move on. The service was good and the place has a nice little feel. But overall for the money I think there's more flavor elsewhere. I'd rather give this 2.5 stars than 2, but the weak mainstay, the BBQ, is hard to overlook. I will say this place has their sides DIALED IN. Can't beat that potato salad and chile mac! Yummy! But it might be time to reevaluate that BBQ technique a tad."

48452,1,"Food was excellent, it is summer and the bar had about 6 customers, 2 of them regulars and drunks. The lady talked at full volume to everyone in the building.\nI got the impression these people go there ever night and feel the world is better because of it. I for one will not be returning until the birds come back and there is enuf ambient noise to drown these people out. Not sure what V's should do differently other than stop serving drunks."
28156,4,"I just love this food! I especially enjoy Mon-Fri lunch. You have the opportunity to several different items without spending a fortune. It can be a bit expensive in the evening, but lunch is just right! The food is all made fresh the very moment you order! No pre-made soup here! Highly recommend it! The owners are awesome!"

28635,1,"Not the best buffet in town, but definitely cheap. My most recent visit was Sunday night for prime rib dinner. It's pretty cheap especially if someone has a player's card. Our waiter was very attentive and always refilled our drinks/took our plates away. Usually isn't very crowded.\n\nThe food is not all that great though. Not a huge selection, and not the best tasting. The prime rib was nothing special. Of course, you probably shouldn't expect too much out of cheap buffets."
3520,0,"THIS IS THE WORST MASSAGE ENVY I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!!! I have been a member with massage envy for over 4 years and never had a BAD massage.  Sure, I've had therapists that weren't my favorite but never a massage I could not wait until it was over!  Last week that was the case!  I booked an hour and half massage because work had been so stressful!  The therapist was late by about 5 minutes and then took forever to get going.  Once she got going it was seriously just like someone was lightly applying sunscreen on my back.  She would rub a few circles on my back; switch sides do the same thing, then switch back and do the same thing - for 90 minutes!  Meanwhile the whole time sighing like she hated being there!  She never did any other part of my body than the small circle rubs on my back.  It felt like time was going by so slowly all I wanted to do was leave!\n\nI finally called back the next day and talked to the manager about this poor experience.  She assured me that this was a onetime mistake and invited me to come back in and give their location another chance.  She offered to give me a one hour massage with one of their \""best and most requested\"" therapists free of charge.  I agreed and went back in.\n\nI went in for my re-do last night.  First, I checked in with the receptionist who was clearly reading the notes from the manager after I called her.  She brought one of her friends in the back office out to read it as well.  At one point there were 3 people reading the notes about me calling in and complaining.  They were all talking about it which was so awkward because I was sitting 4 feet away and could hear everything!  Ten minutes after my massage was supposed to start the girl finally came and got me.  The massage itself was better, but not by much.  When she finished I thought to myself, \""That was short\"" and then looked up at the clock.  It was still 10 minutes until 7 O'clock when my massage was supposed to be over!  So I really only got a 40ish minute massage! \n\nI went to check out and there was a new girl at the front who made a very bratty comment of \""was everything up to your standards this visit?\"" I said it was OK and left.\n\nDo not waste your time or money by going to this location!  You will regret it!"

45216,3,"Summary: A great arrangement of mostly Asian influenced flavors that provides new takes on relatively familiar dishes. But what I also like about this place is allowing the texture of the food to stand out as much as the flavor. Here's what I mean:\n\nFor example, I don't usually order edamame at restaurants because they all taste the same, but here, the edamame was mixed with turmeric oil, ginger and togarashi (Japanese pepper spice) making it the BEST EDAMAME I've ever had. \n\nThe heirloom tomato salad with steak was PERFECT. I loved the use of thai basil. The balsamic vinegar was sweet without being overly acidic. The steak was so tender, we could cut it with the butter knife. \n\nThe charred bok choy was simple, crisp and refreshing.\n\nThe quinoa fried rice with sun-dried pineapple and baby(?) cilantro brought a classic fried rice concept with a new texture by using quinoa. \n\nI liked the tomato soup, the flavor came in three phases; first you taste sweetness, followed by the tomato acidity then a spicy kick after it passes the back of your tongue. I think there's chipotle in there providing the spicy aftertaste. But it was a little too sweet for me. \n\nWe came here for Saturday lunch, the bartender was super friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing. He made great recommendations and even offered to see if the kitchen could make dinner items that aren't on the lunch menu. \n\nI eat a lot of Asian/Oriental style meals (Japanese, Thai, Korean) weekly and Poppy Den is really something special. It does stand out for the reasons I mentioned in the first paragraph. \n\nI visit Summerlin/LV 1-2 times a year and I think Poppy Den will be one of my regular places to eat and enjoy life."
46678,2,"Very nice bar and the prices are very reasonable, if they put 2 (diamond) tables in there instead of 1 bar table and 1 build at home type pool table it would make this bar a very awesome place to hang out at and take pool league teams all week 24/7."
22440,3,"Amazingly delicious croissants. Especially the chocolate. The almond is a little on the intensely sweet side, but still good. If it weren't for the croissants this place would be just mediocre.\nTheir breakfast buffet is small, but I enjoyed it. I ordered a cafe au lait but the waiter gave me a regular coffee instead :[. He seemed a little frazzled, and it wasn't even that crowded. \nOn the window counter side, they have ready made sandwiches and quiches, which are decent enough. The pastries are pretty damn good, and presented nicely. The crepes were good, but definitely overpriced. The macarons were a disappointment, but I have yet to find macarons in America that taste like the real thing. They have boxed up chocolates which are delicious. I like the little discs of milk, dark and white chocolate covered in nuts and fruits. \nThe specialty and wedding cakes they have on display are gorgeous and always leave me drooling."
10667,2,"3 stars for food and five stars for service, but I am going to round because they forgot the most important thing!\n\nI had made reservations to celebrate my mom's birthday. When I had called, they had asked if we were there for a special occasion and I had mentioned that we were there for a birthday.However, once we got there, they made no mention of it. It wouldn't have been a big deal but everyone else on yelp had their birthday person recognized.   Why ask and then not follow through? Not cool. Not cool at all. \n\nService is outstanding! We started off with the amuse bouche, which consisted of a cauliflower mousse. Absolutely delicious. The servers kept coming back and forth to make sure we had enough bread and water. Kept cleaning our table over and over. They had this little bread crumb lifter that removed all the crumbs. That's high class! Their waitstaff is awesome and for that alone I would say go. \n\nMy mom got the recommended parmesean crusted  chicken while I got the lamb burger. She liked the chicken but it was a little to heavy for me. I got the lamb burger, but it was a little too strong for me, so I'd have to pass. We both ordered a non-alcoholic lime drink which was tasty and a great alternative to the alky. \nWe ended up getting our own dessert, the strawberry souffle with pistachios. Kind of reminded us of strawberry ice cream since they freeze it, but a nice option to the end of the meal. \n\nWould I go again? I don't know. I usually go to Vegas for celebrations, either birthdays or graduations and such, so we usually go all out. But not remembering a birthday of a guest is a big no-no, especially at a place that has such a high level of service. Joel Robuchon definitely remembered. At least I took her to go see O."
24902,2,"Came here on a Monday night for dinner. Prices seemed reasonable compared to the shi-shi restaurants around it. I ordered a cider and a falafel burger.  It was a little dry but overall it was good. Sucks that a $12 burger doesn't come with fries.  My friend got the buffalo chicken burger and a beer. Overall it was good.  Looked over at the other table with sweet potato fries, onion rings and shoe string fries. Couldn't really justify paying an extra five bucks for something that  normally comes with a burger."
26757,1,"Sorry, I am gonna get killed here... I am not that impressed.\nI kept hearing about this place and it was so so at best. The food is sloppy and very expensive but has a decent taste\nThe place was also a little dirty looking..\nJust a bunch of sandwiches and the pizza was a disaster, go there if you are into quirky places that charge a lot and are not the best.\nThe waitress seemed pre-occupied by what?? not us."
5187,4,"It's been a while since I've updated my review for Komol, so here we go. \n\nThe food is still delicious! I finally got to try the herbal salad, since I'm attempting to eat healthier lately. It was refreshing and absolutely delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and the texture was delicious. My dining companions got the mee krob to start and the spicy mint chicken, pork pad thai and some chicken dish that escapes me at the moment. All were incredibly happy with their meals. I took some garlic fried rice with beef home to my fella as well. I took a few bitefuls of that as well and love it!\n\nThe service can be hit or miss here, but they were extremely attentive on this visit and refilled our water glasses regularly. They were pretty packed for the holidays and seemed to accomodate the large amount of guests quite nicely. Definitely still one of my favorites!"
27416,2,"What's the difference between Walt Disney and Bing Crosby? ..\n\n..\n\nBing sings and Walt dinsae .\n\nBOOM BOOM!!\n\nThis Disney shop always looks so inviting, they play music out the door and have moving window displays. When I plucked up the courage to take my 20-year-old self in, I wasn't overly excited, however. They have a great selection of toys and plastic things, the smell of plastic is overwhelming, especially in the pencil case corner. I thought I would go and look for a new pencil case - I used to have a Cinderella one that popped out everywhere if you pressed a specific button, I was so cool. However they didn't seem to stock them anymore...they didn't seem to stock anything exciting like that. \n\nMy memories of the Disney Store were exciting, things flying everywhere and talking toys going off on every aisle, but this time the store was quiet, nothing flying around and no excitement. I was disappointed, but put it down to the fact that I was 20, so I took my ex-boyfriend neice with me, and she felt the same! She didn't enjoy it (despite demanding a hannah montana schoolbag) and said she had been in more exciting ones."
9186,0,"I have attended two different events that Emery's had catered and enjoyed the food at both events, and it's located within walking distance from my house, so my husband and I decided to celebrate an anniversary there.  The bruschietta was excellent, the pasta was mediocre and the service atrocious!  We are usually easy to please, but sitting with empty drink glasses for about 30 minutes really irked me.  I was not impressed with their in house dining experience, but they seem to be decent caterers."
11794,2,"It was good, but a bit expensive when there's so many places around town offering the same thing."
18351,1,"I call this place Ghetto Mart. It smells like rancid grease and salmonella. But there have a been a few times (a few and only a few) where I needed laundry soap, or syrup or something. I would never buy produce here for any reason. Prices are expensive too. \n\nTempe is in desperate need of a grocery store. (Fresh and Easy, are you listening!) Ghetto Mart, I mean Rollins Market, is not the answer. You're better off making the trip a few miles south to a real grocery store."
13137,1,"Little things make this place just ok. Of course it's better than any flea bag motel you might find in Vegas, but no free wireless? I mean that's pretty standard in even budget places like The Hampton, etc., at half the price. Yeah, the Luxor has a crappy tangly wire by the tv you can plug into your laptop to get internet, but that means you're tethered and have to sit on the edge of the bed to use your computer. It's not even long enough to kick back on the bed where we all like to use our laptops, right? No coffee machines in the room make it so you have to trudge down to the Starbucks below and shell out the $10 for a couple coffees in the morning, grumble grumble. The tv sets are these crappy maybe 26\"" numbers from the 90s. Don't these places know there has been a flat screen revolution? Why every room doesn't have a 36\""- 40\"" flat screen is beyond me. Why would I want to order any PPV channels to watch on a screen that's crappier than the TV I had in college and not half as good as the one I have at home?? Also, the Pacquio fight was on, but it couldn't even be ordered to the room? You're kidding me? In Vegas?\nThe saving grace is the casino is pretty nice and not overly smokey. The grounds outside by the pool are nice (though the pool area was shut down when we were there because maybe the weather was cooler? Weird, because the pools at Cesar's and other places were open), and the pyramid shape is always intriguing. The location on the Strip near the end makes for some nice views for some rooms. The Luxor should take a cue from Cesar's Palace where the rooms are truly luxurious, and there is a feeling of space and opulence throughout. I don't think this place is fit for a Pharaoh...."
31599,4,"I am so glad to know there is a place like Rips that's bringing back the younger night crowd to Phoenix. Yes, I do have other neighborhood bars that I casually have a drink at but Rips has great drink specials, the star-like ceiling is beautiful, and i love that it's also showcasing local artwork on its wall. \n\nWhat Phoenix was lacking was a rocking dance night. Since Hot Pink ended its Friday nights at Carumba's, Obscura at Rips has definitely filled the void. I definitely get pumped up for second Saturdays! I love dancing to music you don't hear everyday on the radio and the mix those two DJs spin is just what the doctor order after a long day of retail.\n\nDrinks, oh the drinks! Rips has an array of liquors and beers. Pinnacle vodkas...what flavor do they not make? I think I saw around a dozen different flavors from Pomegranate to Cotton Candy! Every time I return I try a new one.\nBut most of all, I love the fact the owner kept the original vintage sign.  With the over sized red arrow outlined in light bulbs, you'll have no problem spotting it when driving down 16th street. I suggest you check it out and befriend the bar on Facebook because you don't want to miss out on specials or events."
7666,2,"We used to receive several buy one get one free coupons with purchase of two beverages, but now they are just buy 1 get 1 half with two beverages. Their breakfast is tasty, but without the coupon a little pricey. We used our coupon for dinner once, but it was still way too expensive, and the food was just mediocre. The service was ok, but very dusty, and outdated decor. Has lots of potential though. Not sure if we will be back."
17829,1,"Soooo, I stopped in to Zoe's on a whim this afternoon. My ravished pregnant self was excited to see a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich on the the menu. One that also comes with chip and a side dish (I opted for the fruit salad.) for a reasonable $6.95. The limeade also looked yummy, so I got that, too. While I did have to drive about 20 minutes back to my office, I still believe that this meal would have stunk even if I sat down and ate it on the spot. The bread was burnt, the cheese was American - blech! (even though I see now, I get a choice of cheese instead of all the cheese listed, I wasn't asked.), and the fruit salad was all green apples. Excuse me, one piece of pineapple. The only thing that saves this place from one star is the limeade. And even that could have been less sweet. Skip this place. It isn't healthier for you, it's not local and it under delivered. :("
2822,3,"One weekend afternoon I looked at Mr. M and said, \""Hey!  Who needs to clean the house, get caught up on bills, wash the cars, and eat leftovers at home?  Let's go drive around aimlessly.\""  He's such a good sport and always ready to head out on one of my escapades, so we took off towards Casa Grande.  There are moments I fantasize about getting out of the city and finding a more rural abode.  Those moments usually pass when I start looking at concerts and baseball games.  But still, wouldn't it be nice to have no neighbors, a couple of horses in the backyard, and 4 or 5 big dogs?  I think so.  \n\nSomeone had told me about some acreages out on the northwest side of C.G. so that's kind of where we were headed.  The drive wasn't very productive on the house-hunting side, but we did end up at Dell's for lunch.\n\nI wasn't too sure about it because from the outside it looks kind of suspect, but inside, it's a cool little sports bar.  Lots of TVs on the walls, and right away the server said he would change any channel to whatever we wanted.  If the Cardinals aren't playing baseball we're pretty apathetic.  I think we ended up watching drag racing or something, which always makes me want to drive irresponsibly.  And run out and buy a Camaro.  \n\nWe had their honey BBQ wings, which were very good, and the medium Chad's special pizza which basically has all the meats on it.  I have pictures somewhere and will get them uploaded when I find them.  Overall we really enjoyed our lunch.  Our server, JWF on the receipt, was great, and the food was very good.  The pizza is a thin crust style and baked golden brown on the bottom with lots of toppings and chewy cheese.   \n\nWith 1 pint of Amber Bock $2.77, 2 pints of Kiltlifter $7.38, wings $7.60, and the pizza $13.45, lunch was $33.85 after tax, before tip.  Really enjoyed the cold beers and the food and if we're in the area we'll definitely make another visit."

31848,4,"First off I have only been inside this place once and the look of it kind of takes you by surprise.  The bar inside is a bit cramped but there are standing tables and a pool table with room to shoot. \n\nI personally have their food delivered because of one reason: their customer service.  In an age where social media (i.e Yelp!) can make or break your word-of-mouth, Tonic nailed it on the first try. \n\nI ordered delivery from them on their first week delivery being available and I ordered the Nicki Stixx and the Dee Snider pizza and they were awesome.  They also deliver booze too so I got a six pack of San Tan Devil's Ale.  \n\nThe kicker was this: they found my apartment with no hassle, they were fast and they brought me free ice cream as a way of saying thank you.  The delivery guy got an extra large tip and my continued business.  Well done Tonic."
28901,4,"OK, I like food and can be a bit picky about where I spend my money, especially for sushi.  When a friend introduced me to this place a few weeks ago, i was like, \""all  you can eat sushi, really? That doesn't sound very appealing.\""  BUT, I was blown away by the food!  The best calamari tempura I've ever eaten! Very fresh, light, not greasy.  And the agadashi was like fluffy white clouds in my mouth.  The nigiri, especially the white tuna, was awesome:  very fresh, perfect temperature.  And ALL the rolls I had were great.  I highly recommend this place.  It will be my new sushi spot from now on."

38416,1,So after the billet bar finally closed Bar 350 popped up and I hoped they would get away from the wannabe biker bar that billet was and the wannabe crowd that always hung out there.  Unfortunately my hopes are not going to come true.  Inside not much has changed and the crowd is still the same as well from what I saw on Sunday.  I hope this changes eventually cause it's a great location right across from RnR and the prices for drinks are cheap.
33133,0,"I purchased a brand new fridge from them that was discounted due to 2 small dents in the door.  The fridge was delivered and I thought all was fine.  Several hours later I returned home to a flooded fridge compartment and kitchen floor.\n\nTurns out some of the fridges with water/ice dispensers they have in the showroom have filters in them - some don't.  In my case, there was no filter in the fridge when it was installed.  When the ice maker kicked on, since there was no filter, the water just poured out of where the filter should be - hence flooding the entire fridge and leaking out onto the floor.\n\nI went back to the Outlet and explained there was no filter and was basically told some have them, some don't.  Since mine didn't come with one I would need to buy one for $50.  I spoke to the manager as this seemed ridiculous.  The manager walked around the showroom, found a fridge that had a filter in it, removed it and handed it to me.  I was grateful ... until I got home and it was the WRONG SIZE!!!!  I called the Outlet and spoke to the same manager who said there was nothing he could do, I'd have to go to another parts store and buy one.\n\nI went to the parts store the next day, with the wrong filter in hand.  The man there was extremely helpful and was shocked how the Outlet store handled the situation.  He looked up the model of fridge I had and agreed they had given me the wrong filter out of some random fridge.  He gave me the correct filter free of charge and said he would charge it to the Outlet store.\n\nI will never buy another appliance from an Outlet store!"

11201,1,"While Sally's is very handy to have around, I hate coming here. \n\nOn the off chance I need something that can't be found in a big box store, I head over to Sally's. I've learned over the years that, based on experiences in Sally's all over Las Vegas and in other states, I have to hunt around online to make sure the product does what I need it to, what tips or tricks I should know to use it and what the packaging looks like. If I don't, I'm forced to ask for help -- \n\nThen I get the absolute pleasure of dealing with what can only be described as the unhappiest people in retail. Assuming there is an employee to be found, they will a) have no idea where the product is, b) not be inclined to show you specifically where it is, c) not have any idea of how it works, if it will work on a particular skin/hair type, if it can be used with another product, etc., or d) a wonderful combination of any/all of the above. \n\nA couple other gripes: the cashier is always hard to find. They still use dial-up to process credit cards. The aisles are wide enough for 1.5 people. \n\n(One last tip: if you've been wanting to try Wen, Sally's carries a similar product called Hair One. Works on some people, doesn't on others.)"
34726,2,New place - just starting out.  Bartender was HILARIOUS saturday night - let's just say a bit forgetful - no harm no foul.  They were having problems with the kegs and finally I had to order a bottled bear.  Got the Classic Cheeseburger - it was fine not bad for $4.50.  Next time I want to try the chicago-style hot dog and see if it holds up.  I am not sure if the Man Salad sounds like true genius or just gross...it is a salad that comes with a burger patty on top and fries!  I guess I will also have to try that.....  Really cool atmosphere and nice seating outside...not sure if I would sit outside in this neighborhood but I am sure other diners will be braver than this one...

We used the $20 to buy two of the worst Midori Sours we've ever had.\n\nThe room itself was clean and comfortable. We couldn't have really asked for any more in that department.\n\nThe worst part of the stay was the salespeople that the hotel had strategically placed at the entrance to the hotel rooms and food court. We fell for the pick up line once...\""is this your last night? Where are you from?\"" When we stopped to talk we were given the hard sell. After that we were forced to be rude to everyone else that gave us the same line. I was just think 'I'm hungry or I'd like to go to my room. Leave me alone.'\n\nThe lack of wifi in the room was another huge turn off. You could hard wire your computer in to access the internet but you can't use an iPad or phone to access it.

Too much produce that is spoiled within a day or two. I'm really getting tired of certain staples they throw in EVERY week (lousy apples, romaine lettuce). I bought a case of honeycrisp apples when they were in on special - extremely disappointing. They were tiny and started to spoil after just a few days. (That may have been my fault for not taking them out of the case immediately and checking for \""bad\"" apples.) \n\nBountiful Baskets is more concerned with quantity over quality, which is fine because that's their whole M.O.

3715,1,"So I was a fan for many years, moved away, came back to area ordered and it was good.  Ordered again and wow it was not good for first time ever.  I called to let them know and I got the cook or so he said.  He said he worked there for 17+ years and nothing really changed but I said no mushrooms and they put canned mushrooms in which was not that big a deal cuz I just picked them all out but the chicken was completely overcooked and tough to chew.  The pot stickers were burnt but not slightly more like all over it had a weird brown color and then burnt on one side.  Tasted a little off too.  I thought they always made these by hand.  I think they still do but I dont know what the heck happened on this night.  Had egg foo young and that was dripping with oil.  The whole thing was a mess.

We were warmly greeted and our drink order taken. We asked if they use MSG and the waitress indicated to us that yes they do use MSG. She informed us that if we didn't want MSG in our food that they could cook it without MSG. So now we . Placed our order....... I ordered mushroom stir fry and green beans with garlic sauce my mate ordered shrimp with snow peas. The food arrived without to much delay. portion was ok actually, truth be told a lot better portion wise then some other restaurants. mushroom stir fry is two or three different kinds of mushrooms sliced with some bell peppers and dried chilli peppers, the green beans were fresh cut in half stir fried with green onion and dried chilli peppers. and my mates shrimp stir fried with green onions,dried chilli peppers and snow peas. Ok I quite liked the mushroom stir fry they only negative would be too oily, and I think they could have added some other veggies just to make it more exciting and healthy but over all it was tastey and it was not over cooked. the green beans with garlic sauce was over cooked. it would have been perfect if they did not cook it for as long as they did. other than that the taste was fine, especially liked the added chilli peppers. my friends shrimp with snow peas. He said it was a little too oily and too salty, other than that he said the flavor was fine. He enjoyed it . And I enjoyed my food. They would have got four stars if they had brown rice. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. The waitress is very friendly and attentive. The decor is of your typical Chinese restaurant  d\u00e9cor.  no booths open tables that have comfortable seating. Every time ive been there I see many Chinese customers and they always seem  to be enjoying their food. . The owners or cooks or two and the same are Two younger gentlemen perhaps in their 30's hip youngsters that's seem to be culturally  global friendly people. All are welcome. don't feel any discrimination here. I totally recommend Miu's Cuisine. Perhaps they will serve brown rice in the future. that would be a big plus."

20519,1,"We were happy to find a veg place nearby our AirBnB accommodations, but were a bit disappointed with our meal. \n\nWe ordered the \""albalone\"" appetizer, \""beef fun\"" dish, and \""beef\"" sandwich.  The first thing I noticed was that all the vegan versions of the dishes were priced higher ($.50-$1) than the vegetarian versions (they all list both prices).  Since typically for a vegan meal you are taking away an animal product (eg, egg) this doesn't seem fair, but maybe there is something else making it more expensive I'm not aware of. \n\nOn to the food - in summary, the flavors were uneremarkable, and in the end (about one hour afterward) we were hungry again and our stomachs were a little upset. \n\nThe abalone was just like a thick noodle/starch with no flavor (the sauce was very good).  The beef fun dish was good, but greasy and unfilling - it seemed like sprouts were the go-to filler. The sandwich was plain with the same \""beef\"" and many shredded carrots on a soft bun. \n\nFrom other reviews it appears we should have ordered different dishes, which would warrant the higher ratings reflected. So perhaps we just chose the wrong options. If I were in town longer I might return to try the crispy chicken or crispy pork rolls.  It's great that LV has this much-needed option in town for veg food - since it appears to be a well-loved establishment.  \n\nThe atmosphere reminded me of places in Chinatown in Seattle ... minimal ... which is fine if the food is good.. The service was just fine, nice people.\n\nNote that it's cash only, which necessitated a quick trip to the ATM!"

Even checked in a few days before to confirm delivery.  Response was no problem.\n\nSo day before thanksgiving, no pies arrived.  All day long.  I had wanted them before noon, per email, as I was leaving work early.   Called pick up location... supposedly many upset customers, no one had cell phone for Slade Grove.\n\nAt 5:30, the office shut down, two messages left, four emails, I had to leave and show up to a dinner party with no dessert.  \n\nNOT A SINGLE RESPONSE FROM OWNER ON ANY EMAIL, and they weren't even nasty at all.  I mean, anyone I know would have been nasty, but I don't believe in that.  Honestly, I was sure he must have been in an accident or some other emergency, and I would hear from him, no response.\n\nSo Christmas rolls around.  I write to him again, a week and a half early, ask for 3 pies.  Exchange emails with confirmations, no problems.  No mention from him again on earlier problem.\n\nThis time, I'm picking them up from pick-up place, a postal store.  When I got to pick up, only 2 of 3 pies are there.  No explanation.  Owner of store says \""I'm lucky to get any, as many people didn't get any pies they ordered.\""\n\nSo I take the pies home and eat them.  They were OKAY.  Not great, not even good.  Just okay.

And they taste pretty decent, but not good.\n\nI can't tell you how disappointing the whole experience has been.\n\nSorry, all caps:  THIS GUY SHOULDN'T BE IN BUSINESS.  Some people just aren't made to run a business.  They don't have a lick of common sense, or business customer service, etc.  \n\nI'm sure the guy can bake.  I'm sure his food is delicious.  But he needs to work for someone else, who can operate a small business.\n\nIf you are thinking of relying on this guy to deliver food for an event, my advice is think again.  He burned me and many others... TWICE.\n\nI'm not even going to try and get my 3rd pie I pre-bought.\n\nNot worth the mental aggravation.\n\nSTAY AWAY.  You've been warned."
25657,0,"My husband and I stayed here last year, and we fell in love with the hotel and the city. Luckily our room last year overlooked the street, not the patio. Seeing as the patio is LOUD, we requested a room overlooking the street again, and were told this would be honored. Wrong. Upon check in our room overlooked the patio. We sucked it up the first night, too tired from traveling all day. The second night we couldn't take the thumping and obnoxious music from the patio.  In the morning we requested the room we were originally promised.  Unfortunately, we were told, \""We're at capacity\"". Nothing else, no one cared that they screwed up the reservation. So we checked out, 4 nights early.  Montreal has lots of other hotels Opus.  Thanks, but no thanks."
25708,0,"We were treated ridiculously poorly by the manager of this place.  We travelled 14 hours by train from New York and arrived in Montreal at ten at night.  We want online to find a place open to  eat.  Their online reservation said they were open until 11, and we made a  10:45 reservation.  We took a cab and arrived at 10:30.  The manager told us they had just closed the kitchen and would not honor our reservation.  He was very rude, unapologetic, and could care less that we had a reservation.  We have never been to Montreal before and this guy definitely made us feel like Montreal is not a friendly place.  If the owner reads this, I highly recommend firing your manager and replacing him with a decent human being."
1220,2,"Macaplines.. Go here for nostalgia, and a swell soda, float, or sundae. *Don't* go here for food. I've been to this place several times, I really enjoy the deserts and sodas. I've ordered food here a few times, and it just tastes so blah. I would really love it if they bought local and had more \""live\"" food options. Everything just tastes \""dead\"" and flavor less. The tomatoes and other veggies that I had were green and as tasteless as anything I'd get at a fast food joint. There are *very* limited vegetarian options, and maybe 1? vegan option.\n\nThey have a neat shop for clothing, jewlery, furniture, and bric a brac from days gone by. Sometimes I just stop by the shop."

What else would a person want???Oh wait we are talking about humans People that complain, about the smallest things.\""went and stood in line,waited 2 minutes I give this plcae a 1 star\"" Grow up people you cant always get it your way. The best thing about this place is they are always on the ball with the food. Little hint if you can get there a few minutes before the price change you can have your meal for a cheaper price!!!!"
46680,4,"Super clean, great service, and consistently superb technique. No need to go anywhere else if you are in the Ahwatukee- Chandler area.  Due to high demand, I always call ahead to make an appointment. Kate and Larry genuinely take pride in caring  for their customers and I have experienced nothing but fabulousness every time I have visited! I highly recommend gel polish for pedicures; it lasts for weeks and looks like it was just done. Be sure to try the salt scrubs and lotions they sell....really feels incredible for half the price of high end salons."
5780,4,I'll definitely come here again on my next trip to Vegas. The food was outstanding and the service & price were great. We tried several dishes and loved all of them. I definitely recommend the following:\n\n- Escargot\n- Lamb chops\n- Creme Brulee\n- Lava Cake
16519,4,"What an amazing experience this was for my first time in Vegas. I am SO beyond happy that I decided to stay at the Signature. All the staff was very pleasant, the amazing pool was awesome ( they have a lazy river) and I really enjoyed that we were able to cross over to the grand at anytime without going outside. I will definitely be returning to this hotel the next visit I make. \n\nThe tub was absolutely luxurious, the shower was HUGE, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. I reserved a deluxe suite and it had everything I could imagine.  A mini fridge/freezer, a toaster, a blender, and a stove top! \n\nThank you MGM Signature for an awesome first time experience!"
14349,2,"This could've been or last meal at Maggianos if it wasn't for our server and 1 of the bartenders. \n\nThe server was awesome! I believe his name was Eric. \n\nThe bartender who made my first drink was Brenda she was a miserable lady!\n\nBut the 2nd drink was made by a very kind African American man which I didn't get his name. \n\nThe person who left a bad taste in our mouth was this female hostess, who was so rude that we almost left(twice ). Thank goodness for everyone else or else tonight would've been our last meal at Maggianos."
20794,1,"This is a review for the craft classes offered at this Joanns location.\n\nI stopped taking classes at this Joanns about 2 years ago because both rooms they offered the classes in were freezing cold.  It was very hard to sit in these rooms for 2-3 hours and learn a craft or work on a project.  I was not the only person who felt these rooms were too cold, the instructors and other \""pupils\"" also thought it was very cold.\nI tried to take another class again this year because there was a new class that very much interested me.  However after 2 years, the freezing cold environment of the room had still not been addressed by the Joanns staff.  You would think the customer and instructor feedback would make them heat the room or get space heaters.  Nope, they just don't care if you are uncomfortable while you are paying to take a class there.  I find that unacceptable and even though the classes are interesting and the instructors are fun and knowledgeable - I will never take a class there again.  How hard can it be to heat a freaking room in the winter?"

41294,2,"Food is unique and tasty. Try the ultimate grilled cheese.  Service is poor. Three employees hang around at a table in the bar area chatting while the cook is preparing my food,  lunch came out wonderful but the front of house staff needs to find something to do and pay attention to a the few customers that are in there. I stopped in today at 1 for lunch but they changed their hours they are not open until 3 o'clock weekdays. I feel this place is going to close down quite soon. Prices for pool during promo hours are great."
19993,1,i feel like this one is so much different from others i have been to.  i am always confused about where to find things and it is hard to maneuver around because of disorganization and the long lines that run in to the aisles.  i do not really like this location but it is convenient for when i am on my lunch break.  i just have to allow myself plenty of line to wait in line...
15037,1,"This was the third buffet within the 24 hours of buffet of buffets. We came for breakfast. Had a fruit crepe, it wasn't that bad, so it was ok.\n\nI wanted an egg benedict for breakfast so when I got to the station, the egg benedict looked kind of dry not very enticing, against my judgment, I went ahead it got one.\n\nWhen I tried to cut the muffin, I couldn't even cut a piece after about ten tries, eventually I gave up, the egg looked very dry, it must have been sitting in the serving pan for who knows how long, mind you this was only 9:30 AM on Monday morning. I have never had an experience like this not be able to cut a piece of muffin ever.\n\nSo you tell me how good is this buffet suppose to be? Does it deserve 4 or 5 stars rating? I am talking about egg benedict, your daily American common breakfast, how can they mess up so bad, can't even cut a piece of the muffin after ten tries? Even if I go to IHOP and order a egg benedict I know for sure I can cut the muffin and enjoy my egg benedict.\n\nBase on my egg benedict experience at Le Village Buffet, this restaurant buffet didn't impress me much at all. Otherwise the rest of the common breakfast, scramble eggs and bacons are just like from any regular restaurants.\n\nOh by the way, the wife got a green apple, took a bite and threw it away. I asked her why? Apple was not even fresh enough and edible."
24421,2,"So in my quest for a new lunch spot, I dragged my co-worker and his wife to Shane's. We were greeted at the counter and the menu was so big, we had to step aside to read it all. We finally were ready to order our lunch!\n\nI opted for the Shack Sampler which comes with: 1/4 rack of ribs, 2 chicken tenders & 1/4 lb. pulled pork with 2 sides. I chose greens and macaroni and cheese. All this was delivered to my table!\n\nThe food was pretty darn OK! The ribs were falling off the bone, and the sauce wasn't too terribly candy sweet. The chicken tenders were well seasoned and tossed in a hot wing sauce that wasn't very hot. The pulled pork was moist and tender and covered in the same sauce as the ribs. The greens were meh... they were sweet! Something I'm not used to. I was hoping for something more smoky/salty. The macaroni and cheese was not the kind that \""Big Mama\"" used to make. It was tasty, but not homemade.\n\nI was delighted to see that they have Sweet Tea!!! Yay! That was a major plus for them. I wanted to try their peach cobbler so I went back up to the counter to order some. OK, I know some people are going to disagree with me, but I LOVE my cobbler doughy. Here's the catch, the dough has to be tasty. Shane's won on that tip too! I loved that the peaches weren't too terribly sweet, and there was a good amount of dough in the bowl. \n\nI plan on hitting up Shane's again for another \""semi-southern\"" fix. It wasn't WONDERFUL it was \""A-OK\"". If you want WONDERFUL, you'll have to hit my parent's kitchen in Spring, Texas. In the meantime, hit Shane's for a taste!"
27977,4,"This store is the platinum standard of a Walgreens store. Aside from the extremely high markup on everything, I still managed to walk out of here with some essentials (like water in gallons vs. bottles), travel-sized items and honey roasted almonds that didn't cost $10. \n\nThe store boasts about 12 registers that seem to all be pretty busy. I'd stop here again for just about anything again when in Vegas."
18869,0,"After one of the people from this store walked around our furniture showroom and passed out her business cards to my clients, I DEFINITELY will not be shopping here. That was low. Not sure why this posted 18 days ago, this happened about a year ago."
35789,0,Wow I can not believe the POOR service I received from John. This place is not worth your time it looks nice from the outside but that's it. If you want to pay for over priced Mexican than waste your money here if not go somewhere that is worth it.
3360,4,"Love love LOVE IT!\n\nI first went here with a friend when I was visiting Scottsdale and now that I live here I go here regularly.  The service is great and they always remember you.  I hadnt been there for a year and the guy bartender welcomed me and even remembered my drink (maybe I drink too much) lol.  \n\nRay is a wonderful host and his band is just great.  Sure enough...I went home and looked at the back of my Lyle Lovett CD's and I think he's on each and every one of them!  How cool!  The music is great and if you like to dance country this is the place.  Lots of sweet people here too and if you are looking to meet new friends, Handlebar J is great for that.\n\nLastly...the food is awesome.  The BBQ is out of this world and even though the pricing isnt great, the quality is.  \n\nSee you soon new friends.  Thanks for being exactly what I was looking for in AZ."
18460,2,"Nick's offers great Italian comfort food with a pleasant but no-frills ambiance. The eggplant appetizer is tasty, as are the bruschetta and antipasti starters. For mains, they typically have a halibut \""special\"" that is worth a try. For the traditionalists,  you can't go wrong with the eggplant or chicken parmigiana (both good indicators of a solid Italian restaurant) and the lemon chicken is tasty.  As tempting as it sounds, steer clear of the  butternut squash ravioli...it's just too sweet!"
36521,3,I was out on a date and she took me to Bliss REBAR. It was a Friday night and I wasn't really in the mood for a crowded bar scene. The ambience of the place is really nice. Not a party spot but people were definitely having a great time. I had their pomegranate martini and it was DELICIOUS. Not to strong but strong enough to taste it. It was smooth going down. The veggie mac and cheese was ok. I was told they have the best mac and cheese. I would have to disagree. They good mac and cheese... certainly not the best. I've had better. But it was good. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.
41513,1,"At La Paz, I was so ready for some fresh Mexican food with interesting flavors.  What I got was generous portions of stuff that mostly tasted like it came out of a can or a freezer with perhaps a quick pass through a microwave.  Yuck.  No bright, bold favors, with the exception of the smoky salsa, which was interesting.  Just blandness, flavorlessness, and dried-out or mushy textures.  Way below-average food quality was saved from one star by the apparent cleanliness and d\u00e9cor newness.\n\nIt was about 5:30 p.m. on Friday, the day after the 2013 Fourth of July.  I took my elderly mom out for a rare restaurant dinner.  When we arrived, the restaurant was almost deserted--always a bad sign!  Because of mom's wheelchair, we were seated in the huge third room that was made up entirely of tables with hard, echo-y surfaces everywhere.  The room cried out for a little fabric or something soft to make it cozier and more inviting; this had the ambiance of a cold, whistling airport waiting area.  \n\nWe were alone in there, except for the two people at an appealing-looking outside table who were soon forced in by a rainstorm.  It took them three trips to empty their table themselves and decamp to the inside--with zero help from the not-to-be-found wait staff. We felt pretty neglected, too.  They never did fully set up our table -- I finally got up and commandeered some salt and pepper from another table about 3/4 of the way through the dinner.\n \nThe relatively short, plastic-coated menu had some appealing-sounding entries that had us psyched -- char-grilled chicken with mango salsa, coconut rice, and black beans, for example.  I was also intrigued by the Mexican Flag enchiladas, which were supposed to be three types of enchiladas covered in three different sauces representing the colors of the Mexican flag.  Yum, right?\n\nUh, no.\n\nWhen the food first arrived after a reasonable but longer-than-we-expected wait, mom tried to send it all back.  She was right, but I intervened and we listlessly ate it all.  As I write this, my tummy feels like it is loaded with lead.  Ugh....\n\nFirst, the coconut rice had been replaced with a truly awful-tasting, mushy excuse for Spanish rice.  \""Where is the coconut rice?  Coconut rice is the reason we ordered this dish,\"" we said.   \""Oh, we are out of coconut rice,\"" the waitress explained without apology.   We think substituting food without asking us first is a major no-no.\n\nThen, the food on both plates didn't look good.  The bite of chicken mom tasted was hard to chew, and she said it tasted miserable.  I thought it was okay but flavorless.  It was one of those massive chicken breasts that had been portion-reduced by horizontally slicing (not pounding) the chicken to make a thin piece with a huge footprint.  There was maybe a teaspoonful of presumably-bottled mango salsa that was amazingly flavorless on the obviously-not-marinated, flavorless chicken.  \n\nThe refried beans were heaped in a stiff vertical stack at least three inches tall and visually similar to the cliffs of Dover, with that fresh-from-the-can flavor.  At least the tea tasted good, and there were some tasty bits of steak in the enchiladas.  \n\nAlas, the enchiladas sat too long under heat lamps before service.The enchiladas may once have had sauce on them, but once served, no sauce remained at all-- just a bit of dried coloration on top.  Above that was a thin layer of dried-out cheese--cheddar(?) on one and white cheese on the other two.  The Mexican flag idea was completely lost.  We ordered little dishes of the missing sauces and poured some velveeta-like melted cheese over top of the rice to make it edible and soldiered on.\n\nA $15 Mexican entree should be vastly better than this.  With tip, our check exceeded $40 (no drinks other than tea, no appetizers, and no dessert) - an amount that should have allowed us to eat pretty well at many much better restaurants.  Mom and I will not be back to La Paz."
20426,4,I had a great time at Houdini's Magic Shop. The clerk was very helpful and answered all of my questions. He was a practicing magician too which helped a lot. He really knew his stuff!
44518,3,"A friend of mine already knew about this place but forgot about it until he found it on Yelp. 3 of us made it near the end of their happy hour and I was in the mood to try something new. Personally, I'm a fan of wheat beers and decided to try the Konig Ludwig Weiss, I absolutely loved this beer and will return just for the beer as I don't know anywhere else in the area that carries it.\n\nI ordered the pork tostadas as an appetizer. I wish the server told me how large the portions were because they were huge and I wasn't hungry from the dinner I had ordered. This appetizer was great and on the Happy Hour Menu.\nFor dinner I got duck over some berries and mustard seeds. Normally I'm not a fan of mustard but I really enjoyed this aspect of the meal. The duck was eh-ok. The portion size of the duck wasn't that much considering it costs about $15 and it was a bit too well done for my liking.\n\nThe service was ok. Everyone was really nice but I felt as if the waitress was a bit new so I gave her some leeway. Overall, I enjoyed the place. If you don't come during happy hour your bill with 1 drink will probably be about $25 plus per person. I'll be back for the beer and appetizers."

13846,4,"After many red bull vodkas and whatever shots my friends were feeding me, my recollections of this place were limited to say the least.  At least, I remember up to the point where someone got freaky on me...whups, I didn't just say that.  Seriously though, great space, huge inside, with lots of energy, and a balcony for fresh air after shakin your booty all night long.  As mentioned, don't wait in line, flirt with the hotties, and have a great time!  What happens at Tao, stays at Tao!"
1119,2,"When I worked at the Renaissance tower, I'd come here when I was too lazy to walk down the street for something better. Because, honestly, their pizza just isn't that great. Or good, really. But I've had the breakfast muffin twice and both times it was beyond awesome! Just the right amount of grease to let you know it's good. And super cheap!"
10137,3,"Our evening didn't start here, my husband and I were out to take my daughter to dinner for her 18th birthday, she decided on Hamada of Japan (DO NOT GO HERE, the service is HORRIBLE). Needless to say we ended up at Bahama Breeze we were seated in the area where there have some steel drums set up and a gentleman playing on them.\n\nWe were greeted by our server Ivan who was awesome...GREAT Lobster and Shrimp Linguine and Cuban Sandwiches...OOOH and the house Pina Colada!!!!"

46483,0,"So this place is packed with ninner fans on Sundays (no I am not one of them) they have $2 budlights which was nice for me budget, the food is all street style and was very good. Buuuuut the service was by far the worst I've ever,had! tracking down someone to take your order for drinks or food is not as easy as you'd think. By the time we found \""veronica\"" we were starving and thirsty. She was very inattentive and we were literally yelling and waving our hands to get her attention, she had no personality and when we told her we were tired of yelling for her she just nodded, no apology what so ever! By the time we got our bill I realized why, they add tip to every bill on Sundays no matter what. So hey why be a nice friendly server when your gguaranted tip anyways right? Only came bbecause of a groupon iI bought, but I def won't be back, she ruined it for us."
273,4,"Friendly Service. Fresh Veggies! At only 1 dollar a person for BYOB and no corkage this place is a steal! The price is right too! \n\nIf you are a veggie, curry, wine lover who loves family style friendly service, then this place is for you!"
43377,1,"Overall a very blah place. The atmosphere is clean and positive, but the staff are not super friendly. The prices are competitive, but not the greatest.

24911,1,"Overrated, boring and overpriced.  Other than all that, it's awesome!\n\nThe burgers are just ok.  Here is a little tip to the cook: try salting the meat.  It works wonders.  Special tip:  feel free to use the shaker with the word \""salt\"" on it.  I know burgers are not your specialty here so you get a free pass on this one.  Oh wait, the joint is called \""BLT Burger?\""  Good grief.  \n\nThe \""adult\"" milkshakes were also boring.  If I cannot tell if there is any booze in the drink, then really, I have seriously paid way too much for a nice milkshake that costs at least twice what I should have paid.\n\nI am also not impressed with the location.  Maybe it is just me, but I like my restaurant to feel just a little bit independent and closed-off from the hotel it is located in.  This place just opens up right into the hotel and does not make you (or at least me) feel like I am part of a unique dining experience, especially when I can see the dorks toting their yard beers walking by.  \n\nTried it once, shame on them.  I won't be burned again."
44344,4,Best mexican food in Vegas.
40857,1,"It's a shame that I have to give this place only 2 stars, because the food is phenomenal!  But the service is just plain TERRIBLE!  EVERY single time we've gone in (and it's been about 6 or 7 times), we've waited up to over an hour for our food to come out.  I don't understand why they won't hire extra help at this place.  They obviously have the business, and need more staff on when it is crowded.  We even sat for over 15 minutes one time waiting just to get a server to come to our table.  I wanted to leave after 5 minutes, as I find this unacceptable, but my boyfriend convinced me to stay so we could use our groupon.  As much as I LOVE their food, I will not be returning after the groupons are used up, as the service is just downright unacceptable.  The ONLY way to go is to do the buffet, as you serve yourself, but then there's less choice in food."
13188,2,"Stayed here August 3-6. Upon arrival the Valet service was overwhelmed due to the uncommon down pour at the time but did well considering the conditions. We had a king size bed reserved, but at check in only a two queen bed room was available. Once in the room it had a musky smell and water leaking from the ceiling. The following morning was able to switch rooms and was placed in the east tower and the room was a vast improvement. The one downfall is the lack of wifi in guest rooms when your paying a resort fee (wifi only available on casino floor). Even Motel 6 down the street has wifi. Lastly to smooth things over we were given a 50 dollar voucher for their buffet at More."
29600,1,"We visited for the first time mid afternoon during the lunch hours on 9/26/14. It was busy but not to an extreme. We split the  Fabulous Pho soup and the Veggie Tofu Delight entr\u00e9e. This was an \""Exciting Rice Entr\u00e9e\"" but the rice cost extra. Not a big deal just odd. We ordered the brown rice as well.\n\nAt the beginning of the meal, the server brought us out an appetizer on the house!\n \nThe food was tasty but I rate it only two stars for the following reason:\nI judge the portions served by looking at the menu, choosing three meal as in \""three meals a day\"" and trying to judge the combined nutritional value. I think in that scenario I would become mal-nourished as both the soup and entr\u00e9e rely heavily on the noodles and rice to fill you up with just a light top layer of vegies. I am diabetic I NEED more vegies and less carbs."
16392,4,"Hands down best downtown restaurant! I went to the restaurant before light up night with my girlfriend. We both got the mixed grill plates with salmon and steak. The salmon melts in your mouth. Best salmon I've had in years, and I am a foody. \n\nAlso, you won't go home hungry. The portions are large (and affordable) and they bring out bread prior to your meal.\n\nThe service was also great. Sid was our server and all of his recommendations were right on point. I recommend this restaurant to everyone. Enjoy!"
7350,0,"Just barely sat in,  at least 10 servers and was not helped out for a long time. Finally got my order in and  staff is not happy at all. Will most likely be the last time I come here."
3331,2,"My mom loves it. My daughter loves it. I like it. \n\nTheir lunch special is a great deal; one evening I went in for a late dinner and was offered the lunch special price if I wanted less food. That was actually impressive to see that they would offer lower pricing way after the lunch hours. So that's a plus.\n\nThings to try: \n\nCalamari appetizer: Just enough spice to make you drink the recommended daily amount of water. Tossed with red peppers and spices that will make you wish you didn't have to share with the table. \n\nSpicy Shrimp Chow Mein: Jalapenos make this dish S-P-I-C-Y...a good thing! The noodles may be a bit overdone with a tad too much sauce, but overall it's a good dish. \n\nThai Coconut Soup: This is delicious. Brimming with veggies, and several floating pieces of chicken and shrimp. Must try.\n\nThe place can get a bit noisy on some days but it's affordably priced and a nice break from having to cook at home. One and a half thumbs up."
14801,2,"We came back recently because of Karina and Christian and had a much better experience. The service was spot on and the food was better. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and ordered a variety of steaks/dishes. I really liked the updated version of the Caesar salad. I also thought the sides were spectacular this time around. The onion rings, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms were all fantastic. The steak was just as I remembered, especially the miso one. I really appreciate them getting back to me about my first experience, and would happily recommend Prime to family and friends in the future."

We had 2 wine tastings, then I asked Eric if he was ready to go...he said no, he wanted more hahaha!  Well I went to the restroom and when I came back and sat down, he says he got me a gift in Texas, gets down on one knee, and asks me to marry him!\n\nJay, the awesome Hostile Grape staff, took some pictures and brought us champagne!  I was in shock so I can't remember all of the details :)  There was a guy and 2 ladies next to us who also sent some wine over for us to celebrate.  We took turns going upstairs to call our parents and left tipsy and stuck together like stamps to a letter!\n\nThanks Hostile Grape and Jay for the special experience, the champagne, and the memories!!!! :-P"
16253,1,"Not a huge fan of this place. And Huge is what you get for portions. But each time that I gave this place a shot, no one in our party has been happy with the food. It really is flavorless. I have no plans to ever go back."

11861,4,This place is seriously good. Come later at night if you want to get in without a reservation. The drunken noodle seabass was the highlight for me. Servers are excellent and you can always trust them to order for you (I did this and it was fun trying new things. Great old Riesling wines that contrast the spicy amazingly. Have to order the mangos for dessert.
22598,0,"Ok...So here's the deal. You know a place is bad when I feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world.  I feel horrible doing this, but I mean come on! Not only was the food some of the worst I've ever had (and I have had really bad food).  But what got me more then the horrible food, was the service.  I sat outside for 15 minutes before I went in to get someone, Than It took another 10 for her to come out.  All the while I had a server that was sitting down talking to a table.  The food was cold, service was slow, and it was not worth the money.  I vow to never go there again! There are so many other great places at Tempe Market Place."
47405,0,"Arboretum Massage placed a deal on Amazon Local earlier this year.  I thought it was a great way to try out a new massage place, so I bought one for my wife and I.  Yesterday I called to schedule the massage, but no one was there to pick up the phone.  Shortly after leaving my message, I received a text on my phone that said.....\""will call you right back\"".  More than 24 hours went by, so I texted the number back and asked when they were going to call me.  I received a call thirty minutes later and asked to schedule a massage.  When I identified myself as a holder of an Amazon Local voucher, the person on the other end, in a very abrupt manner told me they are no longer accepting Amazon vouchers.  When I asked him why, he said, \""we just aren't\"".  In a polite manner, I asked why aren't you...I wanted to understand if they are too busy (maybe this is the best place in town to get a massage).  Again, he said, \""we just aren't\""...in a very rude voice.  So I asked him one last time and he said, \""because we just decided not to, so you need to call Amazon and get your money back\"".  That was the end of the conversation.  So I called Amazon and got my money back.  And then I wrote this post about my experience.  Without a doubt, this ranks as one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had trying to do business with someone.  This place needs to get out of the service industry and in to something that suits them a little better."
10006,0,"Are you grooming your child to become an over pampered trophy wife that has a penance for pink and rhinestones? You are? Well have I got the place for you! Kid's Kastle will ensure that your daughter expects to wear only $20 dollar fake rhinestone emblazoned headbands, $60 dollar tutus, or carry around her very own $100 dollar Hello Kitty suitcase. You can even buy her a set of press on nails that would make a Vegas stripper proud for around $15 bucks. I ensure you they will AT LEAST last until you make it out the Forum Shops!"
17899,4,The reviews are an injustice  for the service you receive!!!! I was visiting the area and wanted the experience of a full service spa and that is exactly what I experienced. Trying new spas can be intimidating but the lady's here were sooooo professional they took their time explained their services and made me feel right at home !!!! Whenever I'm in town this will def be my go to spot!!!! Adrienne rocked my mani and pedi and Shauna made me so comfortable!!! thanks to the entire staff!!!!!
11434,3,"*****100th review!!! I think!!! LOL!!!!*****\n\nSooo I've been longing for a delicious deli that doesnt cost an arm and a leg!! My ex suggested here and off we went!\n\nI got the turkey bacon and avocado and the bf got the pastrami (i think!!) we ordered, paid, got our drinks, and some little muffins and bread! We took our seat and I tried all our little goodies... oh my they were delish! My son loved the hard bread and the bf liked the gingerbread. \n\nThe wait wasnt long and our order was already coming out! I seen them and was super pleased! His sandwich was HUGE!! My little got the regular ham sandwich and was happy with it. My sandwich looked AMAZING! I was excited to eat it!! I took a bite and I swear I creamed my panties! It was soooo yummy!!! There was enough of everything in the sandwich, it was perfect! The bread was soooooo yummy as was the spicy mayo! I took a bite of his pastrami and was floored! I never had it before but this was insanely good! I kept stealing his meat that would fall out LOL. \n\nThe service there was super good! They were very attentive and kind, the place was very clean and I seriously had no problems! We went back and I tried another sandwich (I dont remember what) which was also super delish! I also tried the strawberry shortcake and almost melted! If you look at the photos I have one in there! FRESH strawberries, whipped cream, and the softest angel food cake I've ever tried! This dessert was totally ace!\n\nI will totally be back and enjoy the yummies they have here, you should too!!"
32228,2,"Drive through is a plus especially at 550 in the morning. \n\nStaff seems tired and not unfriendly, just not welcoming like other places. Overall a clean store though. But ya... Nothing too special here."
29131,0,"Not a place I would go again.  There was nothing on the menu that really stood out to me.  I was actually there about a year ago and left because the menu seemed blah.  Not sure why I went back!\n\nThe star of my lunch was a cucumber pasta salad. Very good.  My sandwich was just plain awful though.  I had the pimento cheese sandwich on cranberry bread.  What they don't tell you is that the cranberry bread is cut to about the size of toast points, so you are served these two teeny tiny sandwiches.  The bread was truly awful and kind of stale.  I asked for my sandwich cold, but when it arrived it was neither cold or hot, just luke warm blah pimento cheese, which was quite spicy.  Spicy pimento cheese drives me bonkers.  The standard recipe for pimento cheese does not have cayenne pepper in it.  Why do restaurants do this?  It was not listed as spicy on the menu.  Ugh.  The whole thing was just gross and my stomach felt a little off for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nIf you want this type of food, Panera is a MUCH better choice!"
13932,1,"I would not recommend this hotel. The bellman takes FOREVER...so long that we had to go down and get our own luggage after calling for an hour!\n\nThe sheets were literally TORN and stained! We didn't notice until the next morning. We tried to leave it evident for the cleaning lady but she didn't change them so we called and asked for the sheets to be changed. They were replaced with more TORN sheets! \n\nThe hotel doesn't have a casino which was fine for us but the lobby was very smoky! If you want a casino it's just a couple min walk to the adjoined Mandalay Bay.\n\nI don't see a place to separately rate the Spa. It was designed not to lounge but more of a man's spa so it's more masculine. The hot tubs weren't that hot. HOWEVER, I think her name was Verona or something like that and she gave me THE BEST deep tissue massage of my life! Sorry I don't remember her name exactly but she's been there 8 years and we went a few weeks ago so I've slept since then! LOL"
36951,1,"I was disappointed that the basics (like on and syrup) were procured from a vendor versus being locally acquired (e.g. fresh squeezed on and actual maple syrup).\nThe menu items suggest a Hawaiian influence, and I would recommend that you stick to those items.\n\nThe flavor of the burrito was insipid. The poached eggs were soggy (they brought them in a bowl that was filled with either water or uncooked eggs), the fruit bowl had very little to it (5 grapes, where 2 were rotten, 2 overripe strawberries, 1 cube of melon), and everything was soaked in butter.\n\nThe  best bet is the pancakes (the title character in their menu) and the Portuguese sausage.\n\nI also noticed that the decor near us was covered in dust curtains. This makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen.\n\nThe server was very nice and accommodating. The food came promptly.\n\nOverall, this place is trying to be too many things ( pancake house, Mexican breakfast, Hawaiian food, breakfast basics). They should just stick to pancakes and spend the money they spend on spoiled fruit on real maple syrup and fresh squeezed juices.\n\nI give them one star for the staff. The second star is for the wait time for food."
22695,4,"Very nice interior, good sound and an awesome  concession stand. I like the fact that you can pick your own seats online and at the ticket office.\nYeah, it may be a little more expensive BUT it helps keep away the idiots who expect to pay $3 for a movie and then talk/text through the whole thing. Every time I've seen a movie there it's been a fun, relaxing experience which is actually how movie-going is  supposed to be."
45246,4,"Was great, but tried to go today and it's closed! It says they are converting it to an event room."
34481,2,"Decent lounge, good music, fun crowd."
38550,2,"Considering I've really only experiences this establishment for a few minutes at a time, here is my short review. \n1. Great hours and not too hard to get in or out of. Note - can't get in on Tyvola side but can on the Old Pineville side \n2. Comparable prices to other washes like this. Greenway Express is still my favorite in S. Tryon. $10 plus $1 upgrade yesterday for the \""lava\"" which is supposed to add another level of protection \n3. Thing is, on my husbands black car, there were spots so not sure everything got rinsed? It was a lot cleaner coming out than it was going in though. Needed salt washed off from WV last weekend and it did the trick"
23643,2,"I can now say I've dined at Ruth's Chris and I can also say that I just don't get the hype.  The food was fine, no complaints.  But for the price I expected a really spectacular meal and I got an ok meal.  \nI got chicken and my husband had the filet.  Again, no complaints about the food but we felt we could get what we had at a lot of places.\n\nThe service was good - We had reservations during restarurant week and I was impressed that we were seated almost exactly on time based on how busy they were.  Our server was fantastic and attentive.  \n\n\nTo Sum up - not a place I would return to."
12704,2,"I'm just tagging along with my friends and their menz.  There are naked chicks everywhere. There are horny guys everywhere. There is booze everywhere. There is me wishing I was dancing on my own dance floor. There I go, out the door to be my own star on another dance floor. The end."
8327,4,"First time at this resort.  Exchanged our Wyndham vacation points for a unit here.  Be sure to get a 1 BR with full kitchen.  You can same some $$$ buy cooking your own food.  Sam's Club and Costco are nearby and there's a Fry's closeby and the property offers shuttle service there.  Bedroom and living room each have fireplaces in them; and the BR has a large jacuzzi.  Furnishings are nice and there are 2 large LCD TVs (one in BR and 1 in LR)  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Injured my foot on this trip and the front desk person made sure that we got a bottom floor unit.  Pool was a little far, but the front desk gave me a choice of either a peaceful/serene view or closer quarters to the pool.  I opted for the view and didn't regret it.  They do try to get you to attend one of their property presentations, but you get a $100 Amex gift card for your time along with discounts at a bunch of establishments."
24250,2,"The burgers are good but not amazing, the chili dogs aren't bad either but for me the only reason I keep coming back to this place is to keep trying more of the milk shake flavors that they have.  So far blueberry is my favorite, but I've only tried about six so far."
37237,2,"I want to start off by saying I usually hate fish and chips but agreed to try this place out with my friend as per our usual yelp event. I instantly loved it. the restaurant itself is very casual laid back feel, we ate outside however. The service was good as well. \n\nI ordered the salmon fish and chips in  a Guinness batter and my friend ordered the cod. We swapped one each so we can try both. I personally enjoyed the salmon more but they were both delicious. We also both split the popcorn shrimp which were great. \n\nA great fish and chips joint with quality ingredients thumbs up!"
6011,4,"Classy classic, in a row of chains.  In Pittsburgh for a conference with many meals at Sheraton Station Square Hotel.  At end of conference, just wanted to relax in a nice setting. Was so disappointed on first night when I grabbed a meal at the Melting Pot. Tiny portions there and the chain mentality of the servers saying their rehearsed lines. Used Yelp to find Gandy Dancer for last eve and very satisfied.  Sat at bar with nice service from two bartenders. Had a recommended \""kettle\"" meal, jumbalaya with first course house salad, a really nice salad.  Both portions large and beautifully presented."
13651,3,"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and recenlty had the opportunity. A few of my coworkers and I were at a training in Phoenix and desiring a spot for lunch.  A quick click of my GPS for local restaurants and Chino Bandino populated my screen. I shared the philosophy with my coworkers, my desire to try this place and they were game.\n\nIt was lunch time and busy when we arrived. We were a little confused as the place was crowded with people. One of the employees came over and inquired if he could help us and we explained that we were first timers. He took us to a side bar and gave all four of us samples of the Jade Chicken, the Carnitas, black beans, fried rice and a few others all of which were delicious. We excitedly ordered and sat down for our feast. Suffice to say we were stuffed when we returned to our training. Around 3pm the Snickerdoodle came in handy for our late day snack. Each of us enjoyed this outing and we shall return."
8303,2,"I was in Phoenix for business, traveling alone, and based on the reviews decided to go to Lon's for dinner.  I wanted a nice outdoor seating environment. While I enjoyed my dining experience, there were several factors that prevented Lon's from being a five-star dinner in my book.  \n\nIf you are traveling on business, or eating with work colleagues, I would not recommend Lon's. On the night that I ate there, it appeared to be predominately patronized by retirees.  It was a leisurely crowd, as opposed to a more urban, more serious crowd.  This is not to say that the customers were not enjoying their meals, but if you are a business traveler in a suit or eating alone, you would definitely feel out of place at Lon's amongst those 60-and-70-somethings meeting friends for a long dinner.  I also had the impression that it was the type of place you might go for an anniversary, or special birthday.  There was a large group of 8 people celebrating a family occasion.  It lacked the seriousness of the types of places i like to go to when I travel for business.  That's not the restaurant's fault at all, but prospective customers should be aware of the target market at Lon's.\n\nWhat the restaurant is responsible for is overcooking my rack of lamb, which at a surprise $68, ought to have been cooked perfectly and included a bit more on the plate.  The price on the menu indicated \""market price\"" but I would never have guessed at the actual price.  I really should have returned the lamb, but was trying to enjoy my evening and didn't want to make a big deal out of something that was totally edible and for which I would be submitting my receipt for reimbursement.  Nevertheless, i was just not impressed with the quality of the food for the price.\n\nMy waiter was very good, although was FAR more attentive to the tables with four people than he was even to the tables with two people.  He chatted up the four-toppers, while leaving us two-toppers and singles to linger.  \n\nThe outdoor dining patio was very nice, although it was quite dark.  While I am only 36 years old, I had a great deal of difficulty seeing the details of my meal while I was eating it, and the waiter actually used a flashlight to illuminate it as it was being served to me so that I could \""see what I paid for.\""  \n\nOverall, Lon's was very nice, but the kind of place I would take my mom for mother's day or her birthday.  I won't go back for a business dinner, and probably won't go back when I am in town again in a few weeks.  I just didn't connect with it.  Lon's had every opportunity to make me a \""raving fan\"" of it's food, service, and atmosphere, and it failed to do so despite its positive attributes."
26955,4,"I could eat here every day.  It has healthy food that is well prepared and has a good presentation.  It is casual and hip,modern and clean.  If you just want healthy food or are a vegan, you can find something for you.  Sit out side if you can.  Walk around the Biltmore Shopping Center.  Bring your kids and they can play on the. Grass."
10216,4,"I came to the Wynn for the first time a couple years back, just after they opened. Haven't stayed anywhere else since (and I go to Vegas every couple of months).\n\nGambling:\nOthers have commented on the high minimum tables, and they're right -- the $25 minimums mostly turn into $50 by 9 or 10pm on a weekend, and are kind of like citronella for the hordes that swarm around cheap tables in otherwise nice hotels like the Venetian. On top of the thinner crowds, the dealers here are the best on the strip. I've gotten to know a few and highly recommend Joy at the $50 blackjack tables (usually on the noon-8 shift). She's a bundle of, well, joy, and energy and is always a delight to play with. She'll get the table talking and joking, and really makes it a nice experience regardless of whether you're winning or losing.\n\nI've been playing more poker lately, and the poker room at the Wynn, while small, is comfortable and full of action. Not off the hook Commerce Casino action, but the $500 no limit frequently sees $1000 pots and there are always good players as well as rich tourists abounding. I'm an okay player, and I've discovered that the game for me is about whether I can gobble up the rich tourist dollars faster than the pros can take me down. I've had a couple of great nights as well as one god awful weekend here, but it's always been fun! \n\nRooms:\nThe rooms are superb. I don't think the walls are any thinner than other high end hotels on the strip and have never overheard conversations, etc. I read a review talking about the noise from the club and am astonished -- I've stayed on low floors, high floors, and suites, and have NEVER noticed club noise or strip noise. It's a hotel, not a sanatorium, so there's some audible presence of others, but if that keeps you awake at night you've got issues. I've stayed during working trips also, and found the rooms to be really conducive to work: fast internet, speedy room service, and space to lay out books and papers while you work.\n\nFood:\nMy favorite restaurant in Vegas is the Daniel Boulud brasserie at the Wynn. It's pricey, but the value you get makes it feel like a steal! Don't miss the charcuterie appetizer, and I highly recommend the steak dinner. The sommeliers are superb and have never tried to upsell me past my price-point -- in fact, I was once going to splurge and told him I was interested in a great wine and would spend $300-$400; he came back with a $250 recommendation! \n\nThe other restaurants are all pretty stellar. Bartolotta is fantastic -- they fly in their fish from the Mediterranean daily and when you order a whole fish it's filleted for you tableside which is such fun to watch. Corsa is solid Italian food (they once made an off-menu pesto preparation for me, which is odd at high-traffic restaurants but spoke volumes about their customer service). The country club has what is possibly the best lobster preparation in the country (steamed and served with drawn tarragon butter that makes me drool to think about). Okada is a little oasis of sushi with fanciful preparations and the softest toro I've had since Hamano Sushi in San Francisco. SW has never once overcooked my steak and gets the exact temperature and color on a 3-inch thick filet which is not easy. My only hold out is Wing Lei. Maybe I've just never had the right thing, but most of the food there tastes like regular Chinese food, except much more expensive. \n\nCustomer Service\nI benefit from having a Casino Host (Pucci -- World's Best Host!) who arranges my stays. But the fact that I have a host at all once again speaks volumes about Customer Service at the Wynn, since I'm nowhere near a high roller. Sure, I'll play the $100 black jack tables, but as others have pointed out that's nothing at this place. On a weekend night, there are banks of tables that I can't even go near. Yet I've never once paid for a room and Pucci frequently finds a way to cover a good chunk of my (at time exorbitant) restaurant tabs."
47932,4,"Was here for a yelper's happy hour with my fiance. Was a new patron there but LOVED IT. The owners Moss & Tim were delightful & helpful. Cocktails were epic good, especially the coffee one .... Great prices too. Bought a bottle of their silver rum - delicious! The only downer is the other rums aren't available to buy yet. Looking forward to having my bridal shower here too."
22077,1,"I went in and grabbed a bunch of their raw snacks and two raw desserts. I also ordered a juice. Super expensive, from the juice being eight dollars to the snacks going from a six dollar cookie to a thirteen dollar small bag of crackers. \nNow, I love the concept of Vegan and raw, yet for the price, I would like to enjoy the food and not taste cardboard. The desserts were horrible and the other snacks were extremely bland. The juice was WAY too thick. \nBasically, a rip off. No one should have to pay this much to eat tasteless food for health."
22685,2,"Nothing exceptional, yet no terrible disappointments. An Abuelos clone for sure. Don't go outta your way."
3894,1,"I don't think that I can add much to the already posted reviews, but here goes.\n\nGC is definitely the Walmart of music stores.  It's OK in a pinch, but you wouldn't want it as your mainstay music store.  Support the small shops whenever you can.\n\nThe one good thing about GC is the reason you don't really want to shop there, their return policy.  they'll take anything back.  Keep that in mind when you are buying something \""new\"" there.  Also, there are tons of people who don't know what they are doing going in there everyday and kicking the crap out of their gear.  If you buy something high on the wall or out of a glass case, you are probably relatively safe.\n\nProtip:  You can shop online and have stuff shipped to store and pick it up there, you can save a lot of money on shipping.\n\nProtip 2:  GC, GC.com, and Musician's Friend are all THE SAME thing."
39922,3,"YUM!  Fresh is indeed the word for this place, what a delightful stop for a quick dinner.  The owner asked if it was my first time, how I had heard about them, etc. and I told him that I had seen some glowing reviews on Yelp and had to try it out for myself.  He laughed and said when the Yelpers like you, you're in good and when they don't it's not good.  :)  Such a charmer, excellent first impression, but I had to try the food.\n\nAs the other reviews have stated, Greco Fresh Grille is located at Blakeney along the restaurant row portion on the far end.  Parking - meh.  Directly in front of the restaurant is 15 minute parking, so swing on past that towards Bath and Body and Wells Fargo and you should have some luck.  At 5:30 on a Monday, I was a little ahead of the dinner rush, but as I was finishing, folks started to pour in.  I am glad I got there early, as I got a chance to speak with the owner.  \n\nThe food:\nGrilled chicken gyro:  well seasoned white meat served on a warm pita with tzatziki (totally had to look that up) sauce, thinly sliced onions and tomatoes.  Delish!  It tasted bright and fresh, very good.  \nThe fries:  I ordered the lemon with oregano fries (the owner said if you are getting fries to go, the plain or garlic/cumin is suggested as the lemon that is tossed with the fries can make them a tad soggy if you aren't going to eat them soon).  I liked them - different, tasty.  But he was kind enough to send over a sample of the garlic/cumin fries and they were AWESOME.  I like crispy (burned) fries, and these were perfect.  Lightly seasoned and such a tasty change from plain old salt.  Quite good!\nAs Ben stated, they have the Pepsi (sigh), but they do have Cheerwine - YAY!\n\nAwesome Greek music playing, but not loud or obtrusive at all.  If I had any friends to eat with, we could have easily carried on a conversation.  There is a TV that was on the Cooking channel when I was in with subtitles.  \n\nFriendly tip - your breath is going to be WHEEEEYEW from all of the deliciousness, so I wouldn't do this for a first date (or third, *wink*) or before a trip to your dentist (unless you hate your dentist), but any other time would be fabulous.\n\nGreat little spot, the owner and his staff are incredible and definitely made a great impression.  Come for the friendliness, stay for the food, I can't wait to go back and try some more food."
21495,1,have to ask for refills and waitress just stands around after taking your order everyone walks around with an attitude and its depressing and horrible service.  this will be the last time I come here
31137,2,"Sadly they recently changed management for the worst. No, the food and service are fine, but their awesome lunch special is now $6.99 and with no options. They have a special of the day, that's it. However it is still a good deal, comes with soup (lentil soup both time I was here, which was broth-y the way I like it), rice, sweet plantain and a small side salad (which I wish they don't put it on the same plate as the entree). \nTheir regular menu items are in the range of $11-15, a little pricey for Latino restaurant. And ironically they don't have Cuban sandwich at a Cuban restaurant. \nI am still a fan and will be back for lunch, but boy, it was much better with 3 special options a day for $5.99. Oh well."
5472,3,"Been back a few times since my first review and on a recent visit came for a going away party. \n\nThis was a really good easy going venue to do that. There is plenty of seating, there are billiards, games so everyone could interact. It wasn't overly smoky and it was quiet to carry on conversation. Of course the one downside is there isn't any food, but we had pizza delivered to the spot and they have no problems with people bringing in food. The bartenders here are friendly and actually try to talk to patrons. \n\nEvery beer they brew is pretty solid, with Hoptide being my favorite. They also have a few well selected guest taps each season. \n\nI would say if you have beer geek friends and you want somewhere easy going to hang this is a really good spot to do that. Bring in some food and you're set!"
415,3,"Ri Ra's is a good ol' fashioned Irish Pub. The most noticeable difference between it and a pub in Ireland is that it is a lot bigger than a pub in Ireland, though it's still a lot smaller than your average restaurant.\n\nThe food and atmosphere are amazing. They have the best shepherd's pie I've ever had, bar none. Their soda bread, while not traditional, is very good and is a perfect compliment to their OUTSTANDING potato and leek soup. It's the perfect thing to warm your insides on a blustery evening. The burgers are just okay. The decor is great, with the heavy wooden tables and stone fireplaces, it feels like a real, rustic pub.  The prices are a few dollars more than I think is fair, thus the 4-star rating. Be sure to join their rewards club so you can get discounts and gift cards to make it more affordable.\n\nOh, and they have live music later in the evening on weekdays."
12406,4,"A beautiful hotel with clean, spacious rooms.  \n\nNever had the buffet here, but the casino itself is comfortable, clean, and fun.  I didn't win, but I've never, ever won in Nevada!  haha  \n\nFun anyway.  I'd certainly stay here again, and recommend it to friends.\n\nThe fitness room, while pricey to use, includes great access to the \""spa\"".  While treatments are pricey (and a terrible value if my pedicure was any indication), it was great to be able to work out and then use the scented steam room and awesome showers and stuff."
3887,0,The GM at the Tempe location is absolutely horrible and has no clue what he's doing.. He's a baffoon and was supposed to be fired a long time ago
17913,3,"This buffet is located on Gilbert Road across the street from Mi Amigo's and Carl's Jr.\n\nIt's got a varied enough selection and is yummy for the price.  It's clean, well stocked, child friendly and spacious.  I've never had to wait for a table at peak lunch or dinner time hours.\n\nHubby likes it quite a bit.\n\nEveryone is friendly and the food is almost always fresh, even during off peak eating times.\n\nGetting drinks are a breeze thanks to an attentive wait staff.\n\nIf you're looking for fast, quick, easy eats in a Chinese food category, this one's for you!"
2892,3,"Mmmmm, I love Pita Jungle!  I have been frequenting this restaurant back when there was just the one on Apache and you ordered at the counter.  I live near this location on Dobson and Ray, so this has now become my place to go and get hummus and a chicken shwarma.   Since I've been coming here I pretty much only get those two items, knowing that they will be tasty and delicious.  I always order a large hummus and a couple of extra pitas and then box up the rest to eat later.  I gave 4 stars simply because the service can be hit-or-miss.  For example, I have received my food order- had it dropped off at the table and the person turn and leave- while I still have no plate or silverware.  Then I find myself waiting to find someone to ask for a plate and silverware.  Otherwise, start with a hummus and pick something else off the menu...you can't go wrong!  Just make sure you get a plate and silverware before your food!"
30213,2,The food is okay. The rice is really weird.
15494,0,"This was an impromptu eat spot for our little \""group\"" because Jaime did a little too much drinkey-drinkey and needed to sober up. (they've obviously never been to a DYL). \n\nSince I was with my (former) exboyfriend, I was *nervous* and happy and giddy so it didn't matter what the fuck I ordered as long as I took a couple bites to keep him happy, but it also didn't matter that I couldn't read the fucking menu because I was too drunk.\n\nI was a little loud. And by little, I mean I proclaimed to the entire restaurant that my (ex) boyfriend had a red mark on his nose from some fucking accident boohoo asshole and I put makeup on to cover it up. \n\nAll the while, those dingleberrys at the table ordered some two bottles of champagne and then took my second glass away from me (or did I just drink it all?) and kept laughing at my \""jokes\"", so it perpetuated the continuing of humiliating myself and my (asshole ex) boyfriend.

45505,2,They have good bartenders there as well as good drinks.  The reason why I have to give  the place a 3 was because of the music.  I have been there a few times and I am a fan of rock and metal.  Being that the show Rock of Ages is next door you figure the bar would be playing rock or metal.  There are plenty of bars in Vegas that play hip hop or top 40 music.   Why can't a bar called Rockhouse play some rock??
17846,3,"After a successful night of clubbing, we all had some late night munchies and took the cab to Tuscany for some steak & eggs! We came around 3am and the place was pretty empty. All 10 of us ordered the usual steak & eggs (steak, eggs, toast & hash browns). Along with 2 cups of coffee. I'm not sure how much each plate was but the end total for all of us was $62 - probably including gratuity & tax. Not too shabby :)\n\nThe waiter was friendly and took our order quickly as well as refilled coffee whenever needed without us having to asking."

I guess I will try Best Buy or Home Depot. At all costs, avoid this Sears and especially a manager the named Connie in Appliances who is either incompetent or enjoys driving customers away. Ii doubt I will ever shop at Sears again!"
41920,4,"After living in Japan for 4 years, I'm very particular about the kind of ramen I eat. However, Ramen Sora blew my taste buds. The corn butter ramen with miso broth was decadent, rich, and literally melted in my mouth. I get it everytime I come here. It's average price, about $8-$10 a bowl, but it is so worth it."
159,3,"People knock on this place - but I always find myself defending it. \n\nWhile it may be overrated for being featured on the food network, it is a pretty good sandwich place (no not just because the portions...while they are generous) \n\nThe fries are a bit bland but I'm a huge fan of the cole slaw they have there - while it may not be anything \""special\"" it's a classic (not creamy cole slaw mind you). The colossal fish sandwich is pretty good. The cheese steak is not a cheese steak! But that's because I'm from Philadelphia and any cheese steak that isn't made and prepared there is not a cheese steak to me. \n\nThe only thing is the sanitation there is...questionable.  Just don't think about the sticky surfaces and slimy-ish floors. \n\nFor a cheap, giant sandwich I'd take the germs any day."
47681,0,"Originally I was quite fond of this place, but I recently ate the fish tacos and the fish was rancid. When I mentioned it to the waitress she went right over to the cook on the line with my plate to show him, his response was \""yeah I know it's bad.\"" \nWon't be going back."
17964,2,"I've been here more than I can count on my two hands since the place opened, but this is a review about my last two visits here in the past 30 days.  When my wife and I don't have cravings that jive, the Feast Buffet is a safe answer.\n\nI find myself first frequenting the Asian section, where they have the Korean BBQ Ribs, Pork Hash and Shrimp Dumplings.  Their white rice is OK.  It isn't as sticky as I like it, but it isn't bone dry either.\n\nTheir Sushi section isn't too bad either and is located at the opposite end of the deserts.  Their rolls are very small, probably a tiny bit larger than a quarter.  Their first is fresh and on par with other buffets offering sushi.\n\nThe American BBQ section was great.  They have yams there usually, polish sausage and prime rib or beef brisket. \n\nThe pizzas they have are OK, the Stromboli was very good on my first visit. However it was kinda dry and crispy the last time I went. :( \n\nFor deserts their cookies are better than I remember it.  Nice and soft, not hard as I remembered in the past.\n\nOver all it's a safe choice if you're looking for a deal and realize that you get what you pay for.\n\nService was great both times from our waitresses.  The place is clean and has a relaxing atmosphere."
35897,2,"I go to this Marshall's pretty much just because of it's location. Right next to my parents' house and Ross, Walmart, bed bath and beyond, Ulta, and Michael's are all in the same plaza. Other than that it's always really messy and unorganized.\n\nThe staff is friendly but a little weird lol I was here the other day and one of the employees was cussing pretty loudly in a joking way? I'm not opposed to profanity or anything but I did think it was a little inappropriate for your work place."
17153,1,"I think this restaurant is way over rated for the money spent.\nOn the upside,the waiter was very polite and professional and overall the food was\ngood,not great but good. One the down side of things, when a meal costs over\na hundred dollars a meal and  the wines start at ninety dollars I expect exceptional\nfood and exceptional service for these prices.All of the foods were served barely warm or cold, servings were small. they have two unisex restrooms and after waiting in line,most people left the restaurant to wash and relieve themselves.\nThe only thing exceptional about this restaurant is the appearence  of the way the\nfood was prepared,other than that.this is only a average restaurant."
26018,2,"\""So do you wanna go with me or NOT?!\"" my mom asked me one hot summer night. She had a meeting for her work and she got a room for a couple of nights at the Embassy Suites in North Phoenix.\n\n\""Sure why not?\"" I said as I got out my many pieces of luggage and started tossing my cleanest dirtiest clothes into my bag. Hours later we arrived to a nice looking hotel, nothing too great nothing too horrible. It wasn't exactly the most welcoming place - but it will do. The gigantic pool looked sooo good! I couldn't wait to swim! \n\nWe entered our room and saw a cute lil living room with adjacant dining/bar area. That came with a good sized fridge - empty unfortunatly... but still a good size and I was happy to see it also had a freezer. \n\nThere was a nice bathroom with one of those shower heads that have different settings and of course the bed room.\n\nI LOVED the bedsheets! I literally laid in them all day and night! You couldn't rip me from them! The bed itself was nice and comfy and I really appreciated the long clyndar of a pillow! \n\nThe pool was a huge circle in the ground. I don't mean for that to sound bad - but that's really what it was. I still had fun swimming around in it anyway. \n\nI did love the free breakfast they had in the mornings. They made it sound like it was a continential breakfast which means cut up fruit and aging danishes... but to my surprise they had a nice spread. They had eggs, sausage, bacon, fruit juices, danishes, muffins - the whole nine! Including a freshmade omlette station! It was a lot of fun grabbing my lil bowl and fillin it different fillers for a cook to make into an omlette for urs truely! :) \n\nIt was a nice stay, not a grand get away... but it was something different and I'm glad I chose to go."
24455,0,"I unfortunately have to agree with the reviews. The girls at the front have attitude and it does not matter if you had a good massage or not. It also does not matter when you call what type of massage you want...they just need to book it. You say sweedish..they find swedish. I went in for a one hour deep tissue and it was HORRIBLE. The girl placed her hand on my back and did deep breathing while barely moving her hand. Then threw in an elbow for \""deep tissue\"" work. \nIve been a member for years and recommend any other location. My favorites- desert ridge, scottsdale/101 and biltmore. It doesn't matter if you get a $39 massage if it sucks its just wasted $39 in my opinion."
15893,1,"My last few visits to Ping Pang Pong have been less than stellar.  Sure, I really thought they were the best dim sum experience in Vegas (compared to the other few we have), but they have been going downhill since that very first visit (and review).  \n\nFirst off, there aren't that many dishes offered anymore!  They used to have a larger variety and now they are lacking!  They don't even offer the Big F's favorite - the Macanese egg tart, which really puts a damper on things.  (They apparently are trying out this new egg souffle dish instead.)  I haven't seen the pickled pig's feet ever again as well.  Blah!\n\nService was pretty horrible too.  I thought it was because I get dumped at the corner table all the time, but I just think it sucks.  The last time we ate there (last month), we didn't even have all our dishes and serving utensils before the dim sum arrived.  It took awhile to wave down a waiter and get some tea.  We ordered a plate of Singapore noodles and that took forever to come out as well.  \n\nAnd it's so random when it's busy.  On one Saturday I went, there was no wait.  And then other times it's a good half an hour wait for a party of four.  You just never know.\n\nHowever, I have since requested that we go back and try the other dim sum places in Vegas again since PPP leaves me less than happy and not satisfied.  (The Big F claims that when he went without me, they had tons of stuff coming out!  Maybe I'm bad luck or something!)"
5541,4,I love this place.. They're sides are the bomb I always get the brisket dinner w/mac n cheese & baked beans..
24697,0,"For a first time experience at Red Velvet Cafe it was awful. Service was terrible and it took over an hour for us to get our food. Oh, and did I mention that there were only 2 of us! This place is rather small, so we thought it would be a quick in and out. Nope, nothing went right. After the long wait, we thought our food would at least taste decent. Wrong again. The buffalo chicken wrap I ordered was drenched in so much buffalo sauce it was impossible to eat with my hands. It felt like I just got done eating a rack of ribs with the mess upon me. Luckily the waiter gave us free cookies at the end for our long wait or else I would of left no tip. Cookies were amazing. However, there are a ton of bakeries out there that you can go to with much better service. Avoid this place if you can, that's unless you want the worst service and half-assed made food."
10794,3,"Got a chance to head back up to Paymon's last night for a few drinks with some coworkers.  Returning after a little over a month ago Paymon's was just as I remember.  The vibe last night was relaxing and our hookah expert immediately brought out the special mix to complement our drinks and Athens fries.  Overall, the service last night was a little on the slow side, however, the food, drinks, and hookah were all on point and my fellow coworkers found a new place to hangout at."
9850,1,"Keeping in mind the fact that this is only a 2 1/2 star hotel and the nightly rate is quite possibly the cheapest in Las Vegas, I will give it two stars. We stayed in an upgraded widescreen room. The room was clean and the bathroom was actually quite nice, however, I could not get over the smell in the room. It could almost  knock someone over upon entry. It really didn't get any better throughout our three night stay. \n\nThe casino itself was fine. The waitress service, however, was poor at best. People were actually mixing their own drinks at the roulette wheel because the waitress never came around. I've stayed in many different hotels out there and this was by far the worst. The elevators were really slow. While we didn't go down to the pool, our room did overlook it. It actually looked pretty nice, but I never went down there. We received a comp for the buffet which we used and were pleasantly surprised by the food after reading some of the past reviews. They had a wide variey of items which were all quite good.\n\nSome of the people staying at the hotel were younger which contributed to some problems. For example, a group of guys were still up drinking from the night before when we went into the casino at 9:00am. They were fighting with people as they walked by. Security dealt with this quite quickly. There were two females staying in the room next to us who started fighting with each other at 2:15 am. This went on for about 20 minutes and sensing it wouldn't be ending any time soon I did call security. They promptly responded. \n\nWhile this certainly is a bargain price wise, it attracts a different crowd because of this. I will not be staying here again. Past stays at NYNY and Monte Carlo were MUCH better in that same location.The Excalibur is past its prime, however, would be an OK hotel if you don't care about the smell, the amenities and are looking for a bargain basement price!"
32168,1,"Gold's is a nice lounge, but there is something missing from this place that makes it kinda blah over all, but was a nice place to grab a quick drink with friends."
49215,3,"Pretty awesome spot for crawfish, shrimp and sausage.  As other reviewers have suggested, you are going to get dirty, as will your sleeves if you're wearing a long sleeve shirt.  The crawfish at this place are huge.  I got a couple pounds of crawfish with half pound of sausage added in- that was just the right amount of food. I ordered it medium hot with the hot n juicy sauce (would like to try the Louisiana seasoning another time).  It wasn't overpoweringly hot and the corn/sausage helped cool it off.  I would put it between 2-3, closer to 2.  I also ate a few of my buddy's shrimp cooked in the same sauce.  Honestly they were kind of bland after peeling them, so I just ended up dipping them in the crawfish sauce which helped a lot with flavor. We sat at the bar and got great service from Jasmine.  Highly recommended if you love crawfish and don't mind getting dirty!"
15604,2,"It's a crazy place that takes a PhD in hypergeometry to understand how to order. Inventive food, if you're up for that sort of thing. with the unique choices and variations they gave me a sampler of everthing so I could make up my mind.\n\nWhat you've heard about the snookerdoodle is correct. My theory is it's laced with nicotine -  it's addictive.\n\nI marked yes on wait service because it was slow and the owner brought our food over, he probably doens't always do this."
19086,1,"This is an odd and confounding review to write. This place has got solid five star reviews, so it looks like I'm going to be the odd man out here in the experience I had when I visited.\n\nMy girl and I are getting married soon, so the other day we decided to start yelping places to look for a suit. We found Men's Apparel Club shining like a beacon amongst the mostly scathing Men's Wearhouse reviews. It was a no brainer...an affordable and well reviewed local business...I had my mind made up and my credit card in the holster ready to buy if I found something decent.\n\nUpon walking in, we were promptly greeted by Barry and had a quick discussion regarding the style I was looking for. He quickly found a suit that was right down my alley and that I could easily see myself getting into. This is maybe where we got off on the wrong foot. As Barry was talking about the suit, my fiance got out her phone to show him a picture of her dress, just to get his opinion on if they would match or not. She was quickly given a 'sweetie...no pictures' warning, as Barry thought she was getting her phone out to take pictures. This is fine, I understand his reasoning behind this, but the experience went downhill at this point. \n\nWhat happened from here...I'm still confused about. I began to ask questions about the suit, as he allowed me to try the coat portion on and educated us on the ins and outs of buying a suit for a good ten minutes or so. I liked how the coat fit, and was definitely thinking I needed to try on the whole get up. That's when he hit us with this...I quote:\n\n\""I know I'm wasting my time with people like you. You're not gonna buy here, and I know that. You're gonna shop around and do what you do. That's okay. I don't mind helping you out. I really don't. You know why? You're young and you don't know any better. You gotta learn this stuff some way. I feel like it's my duty\"". \n\nThis statement didn't sit well with me right off the bat. There's nothing worse than being told what sort of person you are. Stereotyping/assuming to this level is something I've rarely experienced in a retail situation. I don't tolerate it in my personal life, and absolutely won't stand for it when I'm voluntarily looking to give someone my business. I let it slide and moved on.\n\nWe both at this point made a concerted effort to let him know that we were in fact very much considering buying a suit at his establishment. I even at one point said \""I haven't heard the best things about Men's Wearhouse and other similar places, so I'm absolutely interested in making the purchase here if we can find something\"". I tried to make several not so subtle hints, that I was in fact very much wanting and willing to make a purchase with him, but he wasn't hearing it for some reason or another. \n\nHe continued to almost 'anti-sell' us from this point out. It was extremely odd. It was like the opposite of being at a car dealership. We felt as if we couldn't try on suits or buy anything there even if we wanted to. He made multiple comments regarding shopping around at other places and continued to minimize our intention to buy. The odd thing was...he gave us all sorts of good advice regarding the ins and outs of buying a suit. However, at the same time he seemed unwilling and uninterested in selling us one personally! \n\nAfter about 25 minutes we finally decided it was time to go, as we really didn't feel very welcome. On the way out of the door I tried one more last ditch effort to let him know I was interested, it went like this:\n\n\""So, if I end up deciding on this suit would I be able to come back in early October to get everything going?\""\n\nBarry - \""October...I may not be around. You'll probably have to go elsewhere\"". \n\nThis was the story of our trip to Men's Apparel Club...the underlying feeling that our business wasn't wanted. I'm really not sure why or how this happened, some possibilities come to mind:\n\n-Communication style differences causing some sort of misunderstanding.\n-The phone issue getting the idea in his head that we had no intention of buying.\n-Us being young and Barry not taking us seriously.\n-Barry possibly having previous bad experiences with shoppers like us, leading to an unfair stereotype.\n-Some other issue I haven't thought of or didn't realize.\n\nIt's too bad we had this experience, because the truth is. This place has the best prices in town by far.\n\nMy suit at Men's Apparel Club - less than $250\nMy suit at Men's Wearhouse - $600\n\nSo in the end, I don't doubt that this is a great place to buy a suit for some people...it just wasn't for us based on our experience. Maybe I caught Barry on an off day, I'm not sure. Maybe Barry doesn't even realize the bad taste we left with. I'm now left in the odd position to thank Barry for all the great advice he gave me on buying a suit, then scratch my head and ask him why he didn't seem to want to sell me one."

46823,1,"So I went here a while ago with some family for dinner. The woman at the desk said it would be an20 minute wait but they had us seated within ten minutes. No problem. \n\nWe order our food and drinks and wait. And Wait... And wait.. And wait some more. When I checked my phone I noticed that we had been waiting for 40 minutes for our food. We asked our waiter how much longer the food would be and he said \""soon.\"" Twenty minutes later, we finally got our food.\n\nWe were so excited to get our food only to find that it was cold. The flavor was good, but when you're starving and wait about an hour for your food, you expect it to be up to standard. So the fact that it was cold kinda put us all in a bad mood. Especially when the people sitting next to us who just came in got their food before us! Really, annoying.\n\nSo the food was good but don't come if you're hungry because you'll have to wait a long time. The staff was polite and apologetic about the long wait. We even got a little free dessert because we waited so long. \n\nOverall, I'd probably come back because of the taste of the food. You should give this place a try if you're willing to wait."
9410,2,"Part of the Boyd line of hotels. The Fremont is good for gambling and not worrying about idiot tourists who split 10s. Or 6s... against a face card. But I digress...

I vaguely made out is shadow and I called out a cheery \""hello in there\"".

Well not these noodles.\n\nI want to try the Sesame Chicken Fried Rice following Amy's recommendation, but I have no doubt that it will be delicious.\n\nThe remaining star is lost because the price was a bit hefty, and I was told that I had to go and collect it myself....which I didn't mind because I had a car but I would have been really miffed if i hadn't."

5188,2,"I love Thai food and when I read about this, I was so excited to try it! The price is great and the staff is great! The only thing I did not like was when my main dish came out, it was cold. The food itself was just OKAY. The texture of the chicken was a bit rubbery, definitely not all breast meat.  I am the biggest panang consumer in all of Las Vegas, and I immediately noticed the panang recipe here is much different than most other Thai restaurants. Not my favorite here. Yet, our Phad See Ew noodles were rather enjoyable. Vegetarian options are available. On a side note, I did like their custom engraved menu covers. Hieroglyphic style Komul engravings on real wood. Cool!"

22825,3,"I actually like this mall, mainly because it is a place close to my kids daycare/preschool where I can kill some time.  I know it doesn't have many high end stores, but I can relax for a few minutes.  Another bonus are the girls who are selling the flat iron, if you buy one you can get your hair done for a year, needless to say I am on that chair almost every week."
1651,4,"La baguette was tr\u00e8s bon! pardon my franglish! I have more reason to frequent here now, to improve my francais!\n\nI was glad to know that my \""Bonjour!\"" was elegant enough to the native ears of the French owner.  :)\n\nIt's been a little while since I last heard the authentic tones of a Frenchman/woman, so I was immediately pleased. woohoo!\n\nAlthough I have not tried everything on the menu, just by the look, vibe and first indulgence of their \""sandweeeesh\"" I will critique it now!\n\nI had the Parisian (Paree-zee-ahn) baguette and it DEFINITELY did not disappoint. EPIC PASS.  I was very impressed on the tastiness and freshness of the ingredients.  The bread itself had the desirable softness and texture that I would expect from a genuine baguette (as I had in France).  The saltiness of the ham, the balance of the mayo, the eggs and lettuce was just superb! I truly enjoyed every bite!\n\nI had a side of pasta which tasted kind of fresh and dressed with I thought was bleu cheese (I didn't clarify with them).  For beverage, I had a very good tropical tasting, iced tea.\n\nI thought the decor was friendly, warm and inviting with French artwork while music played in the background.  The owner and his wife basically run the show.  They were very friendly and attentive.  I will strive to come here as often as I can so I can fine tune my French.  I have a feeling I will make it through most of their menu! The smoked breast of duck sounded intriguing! j'adore duck!"
688,3,"Very basic deli. I work close so go here often. From the street this place doesn't look like much, but once you enter... Still not much. Looks very outdated with booths and a few pictures on the wall, including beer signs although they don't serve beer. \n\nThe sandwiches here are run of the mill deli sandwiches but extremely reasonably priced. They have daily specials for $3.50 for a full sub! Get a bucket of iced tea for a buck and you have lunch for under $5.00. \n\nThe service is very friendly. Most of their business is regulars and they definitely let you know it. After going just a few times they had my name and order memorized. \n\nThey are known for their \""Little Rock Special\"" which is a cheesesteak, not bad but I prefer their cold subs."
7294,1,"Was in town for Wrestlemania 26 and was looking for somewhere to watch Michigan St. play in the NCAA tournament, boy did we choose the wrong place... Order took forever, sat down, they mixed the wife and mines burger temperatures up! Sooooo, we had to wait some more! I ended up filling up on fries and pickles! In there defense they knew they messed up and treated our party of 10 to free desserts, which were really, really good! Kids had fun, some kid kept winning stuffed animals out of the claw game and gave them to my boys!"
4940,0,I used to come here with the family every year whenever we were in Vegas. Saying that I went here a week ago and the quality has completely gone down the drain. I ordered the juk (rice porridge) with duck egg and pork. It was so watery and tasteless. Barely any pork or egg. Tasted like water. Then got the won ton soup with noodles. Again soup was just water. The won tons themselves tasted like they made them yesterday and just reheated them so they were chewy. I won't be coming back here. I guess I will have to find another chinese place if I'm craving good chinese food while I'm in Vegas.
39555,4,"Great Burgers.\nGreat Appetizers.\nGreat beers.\nFast Service.\n\nIt's the perfect combination for a bar.   They also open some exclusive beers on occasion.  Recently had Dog Fish Head 120 Min IPA.   It's a great combination, I've been here for lunch, and for dinner, and all of the above were true.   Most of the times I've noticed the same bar tender, and give props to the guy.  He runs a good ship, and kept our drinks at the ready, and food handy when we sat at the bar.\n\nOften at lunch they have the Burger with Guac and bacon on the menu.   Not something I'd normally order.  On an adventurous day I ordered it.... and am now in a rut because that's all I want to order."
44382,1,"I had purchased a Groupon with the intent of trying this restaurant out.  Made a reservation per the Groupon directions.   Upon arrival I was encouraged as the place was buzzing for a Monday evening.  We had to wait in the \""odd\"" entrance area for the Hostess to seat another party, clear a table & intermittently greet other patrons upon arrival.  By the way the front door leads into an area about 10 x 10 where everyone (about 8-10 while we waited) waits to be greeted & seated.\nOnce were seated not far from the front door/waiting area....it took a while for our server to greet us with water, etc.   Sadly our server was less than warm....in fact as the meal proceeded we only saw him after he took our orders, served the first glass of wine & poured the last of bottle.  I appreciate that perhaps he was giving us space/privacy but he appeared more attentive to other tables.  \nAs for our meal, I ordered one of the specials, Ono with red pepper butter sauce.   This poor fish was overcooked & the presentation was poor for an establishment of this quality.  Thank goodness I chose a side of broccoli as it provided the only color to the plate though it was mushy.  My wife ordered the linguine with meatballs.  Satisfactory at best although the pasta was nicely al dente. I have to admit that I could have tracked down the server if I really tried...but quite frankly he seemed less interested in getting our business for the future.  I also didn't want to see another fillet of Ono destroyed by the kitchen!!  \nGroupon ' s are a marketing opportunity to bring in new patrons....this restaurant is definitely a pass for now & probably forever."

42863,0,"Saw the five-star reviews here (2 of them) and thought I would give it a try. It was a mistake. \nI have had sushi in many places such as Tokyo's fish market, San Francisco, NYC, Stockholm, Buenos Aires.  Some were good and some were bad. And this place is one of the worst. Look at the picture I took and you can see that the fish was not fresh. The owner is Vietnamese which was a sign. I should have trusted my gut feelings.\nThe service was bad. Not even a thank you. I did see that they had a wifi on my phone network but the owner said it's for private use only. Many other restaurants have free wifi in the area. They have done such a good job not trying to provide any service at all.  Ordered 15 pieces combo and 7 pieces are avocado sushi. With a bottle of water and its almost CAD $20.  The two five-stars reviews must have come from the owner's friends.  What a disappointment!"
30873,3,"I came to this Lenscrafters after not being able to find what I wanted at the Chandler Mall location. As soon as I came in, i was greeted by Donna, who was very helpful. I tried on many pairs, taking a break in between to give my baby a bottle. Donna called to verify my insurance and noticed there was a proble. Due to the optometrust where  got my eye exam, my insurance indicated I wasn't eligible fir frames. donna called to rectify the situation, but wasn't able to because the optometrist was closed. Donna let me know that I would have to wait until the next day so my insurance could void the issue at the optometrist. We went back the next day, and Donna had already taken care of the situation. I got my glasses, and am happy with the service I received. Donna and Heather were the wo shinih stars at this location!"
5054,2,"The Thai iced tea was very sweet.  I don't mind this, but it may be too sweet for some.  I ordered the koi soy (noodles in a curry soup), one of my favorite Thai dishes.  I found it to be a little bland, but still good.  I ordered medium heat, but the curry in the koi soy was barely hot at all.  I also ordered the crab fried rice, and was a little more pleased with it.  The rice was light and fluffy, and not at all greasey.  Again, the flavor was a little more bland than I prefer.\n\nBased on my initial visit, this is a rather average Thai restaurant.  I would return if I was with friends and in the area, but I wouldn't seek it out."
6262,0,"Halloween is my all time favorite holiday so I tend to go over-board and spend more money than I should.  Every year I have a halloween party.  I am a really good customer at Morris Costumes in this location: 4300 Monroe Rd. Charlotte, however during  my last visit I was very taken aback by the woman (older woman) that owns the store.  You have to ask to try on the wigs behind the counter, so I did and then I proceeded to put the wig on and look at it in the mirror by the dressing room. The owner came over and said to the young girl manning the booth \""Watch her\"" as I was trying on the wig in a tone as if I was going to walk off with it!!!!  First of all I am a grown woman who is a faithful shopper, probably one of their best, I have 2 kids and I am a business owner myself why on earth would she ever get the impression I was going to steal her wig is beyond me!  I would never do that and didn't give her any reason what so ever to think I would!  She said it loud and embarrassed me and made me feel like a criminal.  I said, \""don't worry I am not going to steal your wig\"" and that made her get even more of an attitude and she said \""I don't want someone like you shopping here, leave\""  OMG never in my life has something so surreal like this ever happen to me. The woman sorry to say is delusional.  Not a good vibe with friendly customer service in there, they just eagle eye you thinking the worst which is unfortunate because they had some good items but it makes you not want to give your money to such a crazy person. Although the store is big it's not the \""IT\"" store to go to for costumes, she should be careful because now a days there is a lot of competition out there with Halloween stores opening, so why be treated like that and why support her and give her your hard earned money when you can go somewhere else?  On-line, party city, halloween stores that just open space for the holiday to just name a few!  Get treated with respect when you shop!  I felt very violated."
6539,1,"I had a gift certificate for one free brunch so I went there with my mother (who happens to live across the street) one recent Sunday morning. There were very few people in the restaurant, probably because it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We were seated right away but it took a while for a server to come to our table. It really wasn't a big deal since it's a self-serve buffet after all, but we flagged down the manager because we had a question. \n\nAlthough the brunch is quite extensive, it is rather pricey at $16. Since my mother is a little older now, she doesn't eat a lot so we politely asked if she could just have a muffin or something small from the buffet and pay a reduced price instead of being charged for a full brunch. This manager (I didn't get her name) picked up the gift certificate and seemed perturbed by the very question! We heard an inaudible remark as she read it over, making it blatantly obvious she DID NOT want to accommodate this simple request. She reluctantly gave in and then walked away as if she was pissed that she agreed to it. \n\nWhatever her name, this so-called manager definitely does NOT belong in hospitality, much less in charge of a popular water-front restaurant! She only smiles when you are greeted, but otherwise has a general rough, hardened look to her. As I ate my meal, she made it a point to check our table to make sure my mother wasn't getting more that just a muffin as agreed-- (oh no!!) On top of that, they TAXED my FREE gift certificate! What a lousy way to treat your customers and such stingy business practices!"
15020,0,"What a horrible, disgusting, overpriced Easter buffet.  We paid almost $100 for the three of us and it was not worth it.  The menu sounded very promising, but half of the food on there never made it to the buffet.  my husband is still looking for that duck l'orange.  The things that did make it weren't that good.  The lamb was dry, the crab legs were just gross, and the cheese and salad selection was pitiful.  The quality of the food in general was just not worthy of the price.  Before we discovered the Aladdin buffet, which doesn't exist anymore, we used to hit up the Paris buffet on every trip.  It was worth it back then with a much better selection and better quality food.  Now, you could easily get the same quality garbage at a buffet that is half the price.  I was very disappointed."
48912,0,"Cocktails with friends at 5:30. Live music (nice) but WAY too loud. More appropriate for late night. \nAlso, BEWARE....there are no bathrooms, despite having more than 250 seats. \nMgt. says since they don't serve food they don't need bathrooms.  Really stupid....won't be back."
22247,2,"I recently went to this location, after work, with two co-workers to partake in the Happy Hour promotions that they run.\n\nWe went in and the hostess brought us around the bar area to the dining room.  Now, ordinarily (especially in Las Vegas) most establishments won't honor their Happy Hour specials outside of the bar area, so when we got to our table I asked the hostess if we could still get Happy Hour specials in the dining room.  She was rude and seemed a annoyed that I was asking her that question.  She said she thought we could and I reiterated that most places don't allow that.  She then sarcastically replied that I would have to speak with our server.\n\nOk, so our hostess wasn't actually interested in being cordial, whatever.  Our server arrived and informed us that we COULD get Happy Hour prices and we ordered drinks and several appetizers.  One thing I liked about this place was that if you order a Red Bull/Vodka (which wasn't included in the Happy Hour cost), they give you the remainder of the Red Bull in the can and our server instructed me to just order a Happy Hour vodka and mix it myself.  I like when an establishment thinks of me and my wallet before their final bill total.\n\nAll in all, the food was good and the drinks were good, but the service had room for improvement.  However, I will say that we ordered one of our items, the pototo chip nachos, and it didn't have enough cheese on it.  The manager made his rounds to inquire about everyone's evening and when he stopped at out table, one of the girls pointed it out to him.  He immediately took the entire dish back to the kitchen and had them add more cheese to it.  That just sat well with me.\n\nI'll more than likely be back, but I'll plan for it to be on a more leisurely weekday and hope that the OVERALL customer service is better."
36910,3,"I come here every morning for my coffee and bagel.  They know my order and are SUPER friendly.  It's not the closest D&D to my house, but this is the one I go to for their service."
15266,1,"it's partially my fault for not checking the lunch menu before i came, but i was very disappointed in lunch. i came on a recommendation, and was so excited to have tapas, bouillabaisse, spanish, italian, and french food! so i brought my family here at lunch only to see BORING sandwiches on the menu. we had a cuban and the chicken sandwich. lame. vegas is supposed to be a 24 hour city. i felt sad and embarrassed for bringing them here. the restaurant should at least have a few of their signature dishes, even in smaller portions, on the lunch menu."
37245,4,"My husband went here last year with some coworkers because he saw it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives, and made me go with him this time. It definitely lives up to its hype! We started with the Pimpin Fries, waffle fries much like Chick Fila's with homemade pimento cheese melted on top. My hubby doesn't even like pimento cheese and was raving about them. He got a Mammoth burger (double) and couldn't finish it all, it was huge! I had the Ding Dong Chicken sandwich at the suggestion of our server who said nothing on the menu was as good as it. Chicken breast, some yummy sweet cole slaw, siracha, and crunchy peanut butter made for a delicious sandwich. Whoever thought of putting peanut butter on a chicken sandwich is genius! My daughter had the basic chicken sandwich ad said it was good. We all topped the stay off with a single bowl of banana pudding, which was excellent and fed all three of us. I will definitely make this a regular in Charlotte!"

4790,2,"Came in for lunch with family. Food was great however the service today was not.  We ordered our drinks and it took the waitress about 20 mins to come back with them after she served a group of 6 that came in after us.  She had someone else bring us our drinks and it was probably because I kept looking around to find her.  When she came to take our order she seemed like she didn't really want to be at work or something because her response to our questions were one word.  I ordered the king crab with a baked potato and asked for the crab to be cracked and no chives on my potato. After placing our order, she tells us in a rude manner \""is that all\"".  The complimentary salad was not fresh and taste odd. Once we received our order, the server placed a \""hot\"" plate in front of my son and swooshed his hand when he attempted to touch it.  I understand not wanting him to burn himself but why place it directly in front of him if it's that hot?  The plate was not hot at all as the server mentioned and I was pretty upset with her swooshing my son's hand away.  When my king crab and potato came, it was not cracked and I had an overwhelming amount of chives on my potato.  I did not receive anything to crack them with, butter, or anything that normally comes with a crab lunch/dinner order.  I asked if they could be taken back and cracked and the server says \""oh I forgot to put that in the computer\"". Not a problem. She takes them back and it takes 10 mins to get them back. We eat our meal, and our server does not return for quiet sometime. We see her waiting on other tables but she never makes it back to our table until I begin looking around for her again. She finally comes and ask if we need anything and refills our drinks.  We finish our meal, pay and leave. We have never had bad service prior to this visit, and I give 3 stars because the food was good as always. Service could have been so much more better. Hopefully next time we visit it will be great service."
20034,4,"This is a must if you are in Vegas. The lounge/bar staff are very attentive to the guests needs. I was concerned about the prices because of what I had read in other posts but they were actually better prices than I expected. I will stop here every time I am in Vegas, Michael the GM was awesome as was all the staff. Treat yourself and don't miss this place."
49869,3,"Could not get into the Black Bear diner so we started looking around for a place to have breakfast before we started a trip.  Came across this place and it was not crowded, although the food is good enough for it to be crowded.  Have the breakfast sandwich. It was great.   The country potatoes are not that could, so stick with the hash browns.   Nice spot.  Will come again."
10174,2,"Since opentable wouldn't accept my review...seemed good for group (LV for bachelorette party). Party girls would probably choose more modern ambience but was in our hotel & compared to \""in\"" places in Vegas was decently priced although still expensive in our eyes. Host took group pic & printed out right there for free nice surprise! Took a while for waiter to get to us, get orders going, get refills & their antion in general. Be aware they charge extra for \""sharing\"" so be very clear even if you're just putting someone's order on your check. No help for a vegetarian (other reviews said there were options but the waiter said no substitutions and no help) so had to eat only the fried veg app & edamame. Waiter upsells by letting you think things are included & is hard to understand. Show was good though we enjoyed the cook!"
16526,3,"I've always wanted to see David Copperfield, but every time we're in Vegas he's dark. By mere chance this time he happened to be playing (yay!) and since every time I mention I want to see him we went and hunted down tickets. \n\nNo need to be seated early, so we hung out at the lions until about ten till. Drinks and food are overpriced, but that's to be expected.\n\nUnlike a lot of other yelpers I actually really enjoyed the montage and the historical footage. I do agree that David isn't exactly into the stories and stuff, though I just assumed he was a bad actor as compared to \""he doesn't care anymore.\"" Definitely a point he could improve on, though. The stories don't feel \""real\"", they are obviously memorized and repeated as if by rote. \n\nThe important thing is the magic! I enjoyed every one of his tricks (including one that didn't work out, oops!)\nI think people need to relax at magic shows and just enjoy them. Some of it was cheesy, some of it was mystifying, and some of it just blew me away (like making the car appear, omg!)\n\nWe got very nice middle-center seats through the half price ticket booth for the 4pm matinee, about $54 each. Definitely worth it at that price point."
3135,0,"First time at Liberty and the last, it was expensive 29.00 for two people for a stack of pancakes with ice cold syrup and a side of 2 pieces of cold sausage, 2 scrambled ice cold dry eggs 1 saus. link and a dry biscuit, no butter/honey 1cup of regular coffee that they didn't bring the cup till after I got my breakfast and 1 apple juice. I think $29.00 is expensive for that plus it was all cold. When I told the waiter he responded with \""Oh my bad\"" what the heck is that suppose to mean. Never again....."
25834,3,"I was searching for French food that doesn't cost more than my entire wardrobe. I'm so glad I found Le Grand Comptoir on yelp! It's exactly how the entire 2 reviewers described it. It's not intimidating, the prices are reasonable, the waiters are friendly, the portions are substantial. I ordered the pork tenderloin and it's soooo tender!!! It came with a creamy mustard sauce. Mmm mmm! I ate every morsel on my plate, the fries, the salad, the pork! It's a good thing Montreal is a walkable city because I can't stop eating the amazing food!"
12548,3,"Zumanity the adult side of Cirque. I have seen this show three times and sat in three different sections. Helpful tip: If purchasing tickets, stay away from the lower orchestra as there are blocked views if too far back. Usually lower orchestra is considered premium seating at other venues, not in this case as is just below the low hanging balcony in which makes it difficult to view the arial acts going on up high.\n\nGreat show for couples! Is a bit risque to take your mama or daddy to so stay clear of that, could make for some uncomfortable moments, common sense...just saying. \n\nI was expecting super sexy and erotic, is more mild than that. Did not give me that tingle and jump start I had been wanting or hoping for however was a fascinating show nonetheless. \n\nCreative, comedic and tastefully erotic...such a tease"
32595,3,"Gourmet hot dogs are where it's at. Station Street Hot Dogs takes the crown when it comes to Pittsburgh gourmet hot dogs, and so if you enjoy putting tasty things on other tasty things, this is the place for you. If you don't like hot dogs, or are a vegetarian, they also have tacos. So, really, you don't have a reason to not eat here. Station Street Hot Dogs is open until November 22 with limited hours--11 AM to 2:30 PM. Do yourself a favor and go get a bite.\n\nI have a weird habit of saving my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants for review only after I find out that they're closing (see: Embury, Fukuda; or the reviews I never wrote for T-Rav's BBQ Lab). Rick Sebak likes to talk about Things That Aren't There Anymore, and so in true Rick Sebak fashion, hopefully one day we'll be able to reminisce about the wonderful food when we sit in Pittsburgh circles and talk about Stuff That's Gone; in the big list of our favorites, Station Street Hot Dogs is sure to be there.\n\nFantastic hot dogs, crispy fries, delicious tacos (corn or flour tortilla, hon), and awesome rotating menu of rice-balls, mustard-grilled hamburgers, and reubens (just to name a few).\n\nThe other day I walked in with a friend or two and ordered my final meal--one of each of their gourmet hot dogs, a nice big order of poutine fries, and a Mexican Coca Cola. I call it a Dog Show. Luckily, they're closing, because I never want to look at a hot dog again."

33514,1,"Order loads of food for multiple people at work. After an hour of waiting, we called back and were told that they \""forgot to put in the order\"". They were nice enough to give us a small discount and upgrade some sizes of food. which would have been great but honestly with the quality of the food i could have done with a much smaller portion. \nCalzone - canned mushrooms??? That is never okay!\nGreek french fries w/ feta - why call them \""Greek french fries w/ feta\""? All I got was microwaved french fries with a pile of mediocre feta cheese, guess I assumed there would be some sort of seasoning.\nChicken fingers(BBQ) - Drenched in BBQ sauce, how bout a side instead of pouring a jar of BBQ sauce onto tiny chicken fingers.\nFettuccine Alfredo - Why were the noodles stuck together? You know what, I don't want to know.\nBuffalo chicken wings - I thought they should be crispy, wrong again."

30574,2,I was disappointed with the food this time. The spicy yellowtail roll was too spicy. They over did it with the siracha sauce and spicy mayo. I didn't eat much of it and none of the servers or sushi chefs noticed. The rice on the nigiri tasted not so good. It was hard and maybe undercooked. I also had a tuna specialty roll and though the portion was large but the rice was ehhh. The service wasn't bad except for not asking if the yellowtail roll was okay. Don't think I will go back though.
26036,2,"If it was all about  location, I'd give this Teeter 5 stars.  There isn't a supermarket even close to this location!  That being said, I find their items to be overpriced and it is much, much smaller than any other Harris Teeter I've been to.  If you want to grab a sub during lunch hours - good luck!  All the uptown businesses in the vicinity are out on lunch at roughly the same hour and the last time I visited at 12:30, there were literally 14 people on line with 2 sandwich makers. \n\nThey are currently renovating.  I do appreciate that there is a lot more room when you walk in.  I hated that everything was so close together in the produce isle!  I am also grateful that there is a parking lot that is totally free!   \n\nThis Teeter serves its purpose, but I'd rather drive a bit further to a supermarket with better prices and a bigger selection.  In a crunch, I couldn't live without it!"
10610,3,"Remember people this is a buffet and not a fresh to order sushi place. Place can be pricey for dinner. You do get a good selection and tons of dessert. There is plenty of different things on the buffet even for non sushi lovers and the best part is the crepes for dessert. They will put out fresh sashimi style tuna and salmon, beware when the Unagi is put out. You will have to elbow your way through short Asian women visiting from Asia!!!!"

On any given day the place will be packed with city workers, CPAs, medical staff from Good Sam, teachers and the occasional sketchy dude. \n\nThis family owned spot puts out amazingly good food. The menu is limited-but it's all about quality not quantity. I do not feel that the food is overpriced at all. You are buying fresh made food with soul-if you want heartless crap hit Taco Hell on McDowell. \n\nIf you live a charmed life and they're selling tacos when you are there- for the love of heysoos- buy three. The guacamole tacos are amazing. If they were to become illegal- I would rob old people so I could support my habit.\n\nIf only they would step up their game and offer fountain drinks- that would be great.

24549,2,"We've been here several times and the food is good.  However, I just kind of noticed this time around their variety on the menu wasn't a whole lot.  I guess in the past I never noticed b'c there was always something new to try but this time around I just felt like there wasn't a good variety.  If you are thinking about coming here for the first time though, it's a good place to check out.  Yummy flavor.\n\n4 stars for the yummy food \n2 stars for the customer service-the waiter just had a \""I don't care\"" type attitude and I felt like I was trying really hard to be nice to him!  What?!\n3 stars for the variety of food on the menu"

14505,3,Came here late night for cocktails and a bite. Loved the dumplings.  Beef skewers were good but kinda marbled. Watermelon flavored martini was bomb but could use a little more alcohol. Overall a great experience!

48021,1,"Well, if you comps this place to both American and Italian restaurants, this F&B's can hardly compete against them. After having few pizzas and seafood, it was clear that F&B tries to compromise between these two kitchen styles without succeeding in neither. There are definitely better pizza & pasta places out there, and seafood seemed to be typical frozen stuff that food industry is pushing into home freezers. In summary, the food we had was nothing special that I would not be able to cook myself. Regretting that we ate in this place as there were better places nearby."

19564,2,"Picked up a couple of pizzas, Greek salad, and a piece of chocolate cake.  The salad and cake were very good.  One pizza had sausage, olives, mushrooms, and basil.  They charged two bucks for fresh basil and what a joke.  They didn't put fresh basil on it but instead sprinkled dry basil from a spice jar.  Very little of it too boot.  Seriously, go to Trader Joe's and see what fresh basil looks like.  Hardly any mushrooms.  Sausage was good.  Mainly, the crust is super soggy.  The other pizza was Joey's Favorite and it also was super soggy.  The website said something about ordering pizza extra crispy.  Will do that next time but they need to just bake it a little more so it's minimally soggy.  My opinion.  Won't rush back but will give it another chance."

You can have it with the cabbage, beans and rice inside the taco or leave it out. Its a quick bite to eat. its not a biog date night here. i stop in every now and then mostly at lunch when i don't have a lot of time or $$ and i just need a quick bite to hold me over till supper."
3502,4,"Stopped in for a morning pastry and coffee.  It was December and they were in full christmas mode.  Pannetones being offered for order, and the like.  The pastry case was full of a huge selection of different pastries.  A nice lady took my order of almond croissant and gave me my coffee.  Good coffee, and the croissant was a-freaking mazing.  Sorry, but regular words wouldn't do.  Fresh, so flakey and full of real buttery goodness.  Some tecchies with atrocious cell phone manners had sandwiches and salads at the next table over and seemed happy.  I definitely was happy to find a rare bakery that makes excellent pastries. Themselves.  I overheard the lady at the counter say she gets there in the wee hours of the morning to start baking. I don't get to that neighborhood much, but will stop in as often as I can for sure."

After synching up with her via pinterest and finding out that we have very similar tastes in photography, I reached out to her to line up a photoshoot! \n\nFrom the very beginning of our conversations, she was welcoming of ideas, very quick to respond to emails as well as being polite and funny. She came up with a great concept, and spent a ton of time getting the dresses, furniture and logistics squared away. During the shoot, she was overly prepared and had just about every little thing I would randomly ask for. Love that.\n\nElizabeth is extremely detail orientated; not only in her email correspondence but also during the photoshoot and post-production. She's a perfectionist and a professional with an amazing eye for great photography and I'm extremely grateful that I've had the opportunity to work with her!! Definitely looking forward to seeing what we come up with next..."
21986,1,I do not know how this place is one of the highest rated places in LV. The sandwich is small and can no way be fresh like they claim it is. Do not waste your time in their 20-30 minute line. Marginal at best.
21603,1,"My friend and I went here for lunch the other day and it was a very interesting experience.  She was on her lunch break from work so she was in her uniform, a pretty obvious indication that we're going to be in a hurry.  We sit at the bar since it's pretty slow and that way would be able to order right away with the bartender.  She came over and took our drink orders then wandered off to go get them.  While she was doing that a group of about four guys came in and sat a few seats down from us.  They must have been very interested because they caused the bartender to completely forget about us.\n\n\nShe dropped off our drinks and rushed over to take their order.  A few minutes later she must have gotten the crazy idea that maybe we wanted something to eat as well so she asked if we wanted some menus.  Um, yeah...thanks for noticing!  She quickly took our order, taking time out in between to find out if the group of guys needed another round.  I'm sorry that it took us all of two minutes to tell you what we wanted to eat, next time we'll try to speed that up for you.\n\nOnce we finished my friend asked to have her food boxed up to take home.  Now, some restaurants have such great customer service that they actually box it up for you, other offer you different sizes and check to see if you need containers for condiments as well.  Here at the Fox and Hound they throw the box in front of you as they're hurrying to flirt with the group of guys sitting near you.\n\nNeedless to say we were less than thrilled with our lunch hour experience.  But at least now we know that if we want to have good service next time we just need to make sure that there are absolutely no men in the restaurant to distract the server!"

35934,3,"The Harrah's casino on the Las Vegas Strip is home to the longest running celebrity tribute show in the world.  The show consists of five \""superstars\"", which change quite frequently, to keep things fresh and to keep audiences returning to see the show.  \n\nEach tribute performer is backed by a live band, backing singers and dancers.  There's VIP seating at the front - kind of theater-like seats in rows, but with a little cup holder so that you can keep your drink with you - this is Vegas after all!  There's booths with tables in the center and towards the back, and as you get further back, the level is raised, so I should think everyone gets a good view.  There are two large screens either side of the stage, used very cleverly to show footage of the real star, along with live footage of the stage show as it happens.\n\nThe show I saw, on a Sunday night, was pretty packed.  We had dinner in the casino's Asian restaurant - service was speedy, as we told them we were going to a show, and the food was very good.  The audience had a wide age group and everyone seemed to be having lots of fun.\n\nOur first performer was a Michael Jackson tribute.  The dancing was fabulous, from him and from the backing dancers, they did a great rendition of Thriller and he even moonwalked.  He didn't score as highly on sounding like him, as he did for dancing like him, but he did pretty well.\n\nThe second performer was a Justin Timberlake tribute.  I refer you here to the name of the show: Legends.  I do know one Timberlake song, but they didn't perform that one.  Again, more excellent dance routines, and the singer was charming and funny.  As we left I heard other people commenting on how he had got into a \""Legends\"" show, a strange choice, in my opinion.\n\nOur third performance was a Blues Brothers tribute.  These guys were getting on in years, but still danced up a storm, like the real thing.  Great soul and blues songs, great jokes, a nice, playful set.\n\nThe next show was put on by a pretty convincing Tina Turner tribute.  She was a fit and lithe older lady with an amazing set of lungs, just like the real thing.  More great dance routines and some killer songs.  Since it was Sunday, she did her version of Tina's version of Proud Mary.\n\nOur final performance just had to be Elvis, didn't it?  He did the classics, interacted with the audience beautifully, made us sing along, and made us laugh.  This was the section with the best costumes, and the showiest lights, but then, that's how it should be for Elvis!\n\nThe show lasted around an hour and fifteen minutes.  There was a bar in the theater, so you can keep drinking if you wish.  To my mind, the greatest stars of this show were the backing dancers.  Even if I didn't know a song too well, and that's always a possibility when you see a mixed show like this, they entertained me.  The backing band, singers and dancers were one stage the whole show, and if they were tired from working so hard they didn't show it.  The costumes were incredible and we got at least one costume change per performer. It's a treat for your eyes as well as your ears, but the only drawback is that you don't know which five \""stars\"" you will get for your show."

A $12 hot dog verses a $12 Chinese food.. take YOUR pick. \n\nHighlights & Low-lights:\n\n*Pricey but think about where you are\n*Ordered the BBQ Pork Soup: The broth wasn't flavorful AT ALL but it's nothing a LOAD of hot and hoisin sauce can't fix\n*Pork itself was good but overly fatty\n*Lines can get long so of course the wait can get lengthy as well\n*Service was middle of the road \n*Lots of condiments out for your taste buds pleasure\n\nYes, I've had WAYYY better Chinese food.

26169,2,"Had a chance to check out Lancasters last week from some BBQ take-out. Have driven past this place for years and never stopped in. Located on Beatties Ford just north of Mount Holly-Huntersville Road, it's easy to miss. There's a restaurant side and a bar side, which is where the take out area is. Very friendly staff. Ordered the chicken/pork combo and it was decent. Nothing wowed me about it, but it was pretty good. The mac & cheese side was really good though and I'd recommend that. Good place for a quick lunch and I can see why this is a 5pm place for many workers. Pork was better than the chicken, so if I go again, I'll probably just go with the pork platter."
24404,2,"As with most artisanal cheese shops I've been to, Fromagination is like a happy rustic wonderland. Major points for the rotating (random) assortment of \""small pieces,\"" (\""orphans,\"" as another reviewer pointed out) which are basically just the broken-off chunks from larger slices, priced at around a few bucks each. \n\nThe selection from local dairies is great (especially for tourists like me!) but despite the basically friendly service, I did feel a hint of annoyance from the cheesemongers when I asked my fifth or sixth question. Fromagination is clearly a popular destination for out-of-towners looking for the \""local experience,\"" but the high volume foot-traffic seems to take its toll on the service. I have high expectations for artisanal shops -- Isn't personalized service a rudimentary characteristic of such places? --  \nbut it's possible I expect too much. Or it's possible I just visited on an \""off\"" day. \n\nRegardless, I felt like I received a nice introduction to some of Wisconsin's prized cheeses, and loved the additional selection of carby accompaniments. Please, Lord, have Whole Foods carry Potter's Crackers at some point in the near future?"

41992,4,"This is a hidden gem for the City of Henderson. It's not just because it's new at the time I write this, this is the park my 2 year old likes best. More to climb, more to do, and the view is pretty cool too. The skatepark is always busy...even if you can't skate it's kinda fun to watch for a little bit. This park as another reviewer mentioned is a gateway park to trails and various other areas. It's got trails that will help you work up a good sweat in a hurry but the views make you forget all about that. 5 stars...my 2 year old would give his approval but he's too busy climbing on the playground equipment to say much. I-515 at Horizon Drive. Exit the Interstate, turn towards the mountain...it's tucked in behind Vons."
48615,4,"Authentic urban dining experience! Stellar. Fast, friendly service and good conversation if you can catch 'em when they're not too busy.

37168,2,"We recently came here for our anniversary as we were in town. Although the reviews were great, we were a little skeptical upon walking in. The restaurant does have  a 'cool' vibe and the patio is nice, however we were seated in a pretty tight table outside, against a wall, behind a tree...that wasn't a great start to our anniversary dinner. We started with the mac n' cheese, which my husband swears is the best ever! He had the mussels and I had the short ribs (note* if you're preggo, this restaurant may be on the 'after baby' list as it has a lot of shellfish and ingredients that you can't eat when your pregnant). Overall the service was 'ok', our server was efficient, but didn't seem to really want to be there, just get her job done. Overall, food was good, service was ok.. and i wish I could say ambiance was stellar, but I think we got the short end of the stick."

32486,1,"I like Johnny Rockets, but this location sucks.\n\nYou're paying a premium price for a certain experience, and then the experience is lost because of the space it's in.

I'm still waiting.  I have vowed before, with difficult experiences at this store, that I would not return, but this time I think it will stick.  In the future, I will order from other establishments online, even though they might cost more."

239,4,"Haven't been in a while (not really a bike nut, or even a regular rider) but I have to relate a story to tell you what kind of a place this is... I inherited a bike my dad had purchased in college, and hard a part break, I knew that Kraynick's would be the only place able to help, even though at the time there were still Schwinn \""authorized\"" dealers in the area. \n\nHere's the exchange: \n\nMe: \""I have an old Schwinn three-speed, probably from 1969 or '70, and it has this little washer with a raised part that fits in the groove between the fork and the rear axle. That part broke.\"" \n\nHim: \""A Collegiate or a Speedster?\"" \n\nMe (amazed): \""Speedster.\"" \n\nAt which point he turned around to a wall of tiny drawers that seemed to stretch from floor to ceiling and appeared to have no intelligible labeling, pull open a single drawer, and produce the part I needed. It cost something like 30 cents... \n\nPlaces like this pretty much do not exist anymore, the shop is like a museum of bicycle parts (and the upper stories of the building are reportedly just as full). If the recurring rumors of its closing / Mr. Kraynick's retirement are any indication, it may not be here forever. FIND ANY EXCUSE to get here while it's still around!"
21897,2,"The staff is really awesome, and I grew up by an arcade so it definitley takes me back. \n\nHowever on a busy night this place is clearly a spot for bad parents to go out and drink while their 8 kids run around, one ran into me and I spilled some of my drink. I'd say go to this place on a school night."
25548,4,"This is best record shop I've been to while in Montreal. The selection of music definitely fits the bill of indie and interesting. They even had a good selection of Numero Group albums, the incredible soul and funk label out of Chicago.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you can get tickets to pretty much any indie show in the city here at face value. They'll charge you a slight fee for paying with credit, but it's still the cheapest place to stock up on tickets. The guys who work here are super helpful and didn't mind one bit that we didn't French.  I wished I lived closer so I could visit more often. Highly recommended."
36128,3,"Pretty decent restaurant, just not as amazing as I was expecting. \n\nWent here on a date with my husband and we both agree it's not a great date spot unless you don't like to talk to your significant other. It was far too loud for any sort of conversation and the tables were so close together you could hear what everyone around you was discussing. \n\nOn the flip side, the food was very nice. We had the Caesar Salad, Salmon Hot & Cold (scrumptious), Duck Two Ways, Filet & Short Ribs, and the apple and baklava desserts. Everything came out gorgeously plated, though we found the portions to be a little small. \n\nThe salmon app was cooked to perfection, as was my duck breast. The husband insists his short ribs could have been cooked more, but I had some and they were pretty tasty. \n\nOne random side-note: there was a medley of delicious but unidentifiable roasted root veggies on my plate and one of them (the orange-ish one) I hated violently. It tasted like sour dirt. I am confident it's a personal preference, but I'd love to know what it was so I can avoid it in the future. I don't think it was the turnips.\n\nBack to the food: dessert was also very tasty, if a bit small-portioned. And, as an added bonus, Spoon has a great specialty cocktail list. I had the Vancouver in a Glass, which was wonderfully scotch-y and weirdly effervescent. In my opinion, an imaginative specialty cocktail menu gives a restaurant serious bonus points. \n\nIt's also worth noting that they had a very extensive wine menu.\n\nThe service was not bad, not awesome either though. I'm still not sure who my server was, which made it that much harder to tip. At least three people came to the table more than once, and we were a little over-waited on.\n\nOverall, I'll be back, but preferably with a group"
42652,0,"Me and my girlfriend went here on our date night, since its less than a mile from our place! We got seated pretty fast, but it went downhill from there. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen, and at least 3 employees passed us by without saying a word. We were hungry and thirsty but after 10 minutes of waiting, we decided that they didn't need our business and we left! Very disappointed!! Luckily there is a Garcias right down the street, and we had excellent service as usual.. Don't waste your valuable time on La Fonda's"
2514,1,"Once again I am completely \""under-whelmed\"".\nFor the price point you'd believe it would be fantastic. Not so much.\nOrdered the butter fish which is a Roy's classic and received a \""new\"" version on the presentation.\nThe fish was flat and a tad overcooked and the rice was in a shaped triangle.\nWhere was the version atop the forbidden rice?\nTook two colleagues there for a dinner after a meeting and the bill was right around $300.\nI am quite sure for $100/person there are better choices in the valley.\nIt seems on more than one occasion at the 2 Roy's in the valley the service has been off. Not, bad per se. Just not what you would expect for a place of this \""expected\"" caliber. A good example would be; the waiter in a clueless fashion interrupting speakers in a business meeting to ask \""how the bread tastes?\""\nWhy? because your server just started at Roy's last week.\nPerhaps they have issues with employee turnover as well.\n\nOver priced, unprofessional, simply just not that good."
38545,4,"I tried this place for lunch today and really enjoyed the food and the pricing. The owners' little girl opened up the door for my wife and I. The whole family seemed excited to see customers and was very hospitable.\n\nThis place occupies the old Meatballz (next to Habanero's) and is very modern and has pleny of tables and elbow room. They cook the usual assortment of Chinese dishes and serve Sushi as well. This place is fast food that is cooked to order. They probably have over 30 dishes that they prepare. \n\nI had the Sesame Chicken, which was served with fried rice and  a vegetable egg roll. There was a heaping portion of chicken and it was delicious. My wife had an out of body experience with the Shrimp Lo Mein. She couldn't believe how many shrimps there were plus she was raving about how tasty the noodles were. All of this for about $8 per person (we had one soft drink). Also they have Diet Dr Pepper which is a major selling point for me.\n\nNeedless to say, we will be back to try the rest of the menu."

Fantastic..the honey hot are the best wings ever, tarot tots...yum! And the watermelon margaritas and the long island iced tea are the best ive had.

24474,0,"My family was in town the first weekend in November for my nephew's university graduation. We chose Claim Jumper as our one special celebration meal together (there were 15 of us). It was so disappointing.\n\nWe had been driving all day and the kids were starving. Our waiter was slow, impatient, and incompetent. He rolled his eyes at us several times. He spent too much time trying to pressure us into buying some card for regulars even though we don't even have Claim Jumpers in our state.\n\nHe messed up over half the orders. For instance, my nephew's wife never got part of her meal, and the kids never got their drinks. My nephew asked for no onions and got onions. He forgot to ask what side I wanted, and blamed it on me 20 minutes later: \""You didn't tell me what you wanted.\"" He didn't give me a chance. 20 more minutes after that, he informed me that they were out of what I ordered and shoved a menu at me. I chose the chili in a bread bowl that he highly recommended, and got chili without a bread bowl. My sister-in-law barely touched her food because it wasn't good. We are not a picky group! By then we were starving and even though we were right by his POS station, we rarely saw him and couldn't get his attention, so we made do with what we got. The chili he highly recommended tasted like canned Nalley chili with some chunks of meat thrown in.\n\nThen he couldn't split our check, even though we told him at the beginning that we would have separate checks. He was huffy and impatient as we told him again who was together, and since we'd been there so long my brother finally told him we'd work it out on our own. He rudely said, \""Good, because see what I'm dealing with?\"" and showed us some crazy chicken scratch diagram he made. He was clearly not trained or qualified or something when it came to serving a big group. \n\nWhen we analyzed the check, I saw that he had charged us for my original meal that they were out of, plus the one I ordered to replace it (which wasn't right either, but I ate it). It took at least 15 minutes to find him and bring it to his attention, and then he was huffy and abrupt about it. I got a half-apology but no offer to make it up to us in any way. We contemplated going to the manager but we were exhausted and just wanted to go to our hotel.\n\nI hope that was an unusual experience, because I honestly have never had such rude and incompetent service in my life. I know that food service is hard work and I try to give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt, but there was no excuse for his sloppy waiting and especially his rude attitude. \n\nThankfully, my nephew took me afterward to the other side of town to get the best street taco I've ever had. :) Next time I visit him in Vegas, I'll definitely avoid Claim Jumper."

This place is for people who like to think they are cool and like to be seen being what they think is cool.  We started with a tomato soup that was flat in flavor and tasteless with raw crunchy slices of tomatoes placed in it.  But that was not the worsted of it.  It was served luke warm  with a chunk of brie,, oh but there is more, the rind  was still on eeeuuuu, omg it was gross!  We ordered the big New York steak ... Dont bother talk about false advertising this is more like a  top round of the lowest quality.  It was not edible, you just chew and chew and chew.  If you enjoy beef gum this is the steak for you, but lay in some dental floss cause boy you will need it.  Service was something out of a fast food restaurant hurried and careless.  For us this by far has won the #1 bad meal of the last 5 years.  Up side they sat us in the garden area which was cool temp wise and very pleasant if I had known the best food in the house was in those pots growing besides me not only would I have saved a bucked to cash, but had a better meal."

23499,0,"RUN - don't walk - from this awful agency.  Was just in Vegas this past weekend visiting family.  I've been renting cars for years and usually just go with the best deal and this was no exception.  Next time will definitely spend the few dollars more to avoid this HORRENDOUS company.  I waited in line for an hour and ten minutes just to do the paperwork (although I already had a reservation) because it was a holiday but there were only 2 agents available of the 8+ desks.  Once I paid for my car I walked to the lot and waited again.  This time for 35 minutes in 100 degrees.  The sparce staff was cold and obviously burned out and didn't care.  Once I finally got my car it was another 20 minutes to exit the lot because only ONE of the three exit lanes was open (and these were exclusively Dollar lot exits).  Four days later when I went to return the car the line extended beyond the entrance with ONE person working.  Again, waited 35 minutes for a very rude agent to check my car in.\n\nNEVER have I had such a terrible experience with a car rental.  I wish I could give negative stars."
33061,0,"Horrible service!  After paying $80 for an interior detail & exterior wax, I dropped my car off at 8:30am.  Johnny, a persistent, rude sales rep asked me 4 times if I wanted to add $40 to have it buffered.  Johnny told me the detail and wax would take 2-4 hours.  At 4pm, I arrived to find my car was not done and would not be until 5:30pm.  Asking to speak with a manager, I was introduced to Jonathan.  He was also rude, unapologetic and offered no customer service.  Needing to be somewhere by 5pm I had to take my car only 1/4 done.  I asked for a refund and was told no because they would finish if I stayed.    Both at the time of paying & pick up I had to wait in line due to other upset customers complaining about service to the counter clerk Ashley and the manager Jonathan."
13520,1,"After reading so many positive reviews, I expected much more from this place.  While the dish presentations were attractive and the flatbread was pretty good, the rest of our experience was unimpressive.  There are many other restaurants I would visit before considering a return to Eno Vino."

42451,0,"I bought a half off depot coupon to get my carpets cleaned by Carolina pristine. When the associate came out to clean the carpets, I also paid an extra $45 to have spots on the carpet removed. He told me that the spots could possibly resurface and he would come back if they did and try to treat them. The stains came back (one DOUBLE the size). During a week and a half period I called the company three times and never received a return phone call. The owner, Josh, emailed me back and told me there is nothing they could do, they don't come back out and he was sorry I was dissatisfied and \""best regards\"". \n\nI will never use this company again because of their terrible customer service and their unsatisfactory cleaning job. Would never recommend their services to anyone."
13642,2,The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it. The sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful. We also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal. I would definitely come back.
26115,4,"Having read the rave reviews about  Au Pied de Cochon,I had high expectations before I even arrived. I`m pleased to say they weren't only met, they were exceeded! The atmosphere was lovely, the service fantastic and the food incredible. Five stars!\n\nTo start, my friend and I shared the snails and the salami tray. I have to say the thought of eating snails grossed me out, but I reluctantly tried them. They were delicious. The brandy and BBQ in the sauce made the dish. The salami tray was predictably scrumptious.\n\nFor my \""high gear\"", I had the duck carpaccio This was possibly the best duck I've ever had. Even if you're not a huge duck  fan, I still think you should try it. The cream sauce drizzled over it was fantastic.\n\n\nI almost forgot to share my cocktail experience. You must get the Pom Pom! It`s got pomegranate juice, ginger and mint, to name a few ingredients. I also tried the Rosemary Pink Diamond Fuzz which was also very good. I had a sip of the Blue Mojito, but it was too sweet for my liking.\n\nSimply put, Au Pied de Cochon is superb. I can`t wait to go back."
39184,3,"I completely agree with October R's 4/19/11 review regarding the general vibe of this place.  Very inviting; cool concept--a blend of \""old world\"" attention to deli-style comfort food with a modern, slightly edgy sensibility.\n\nWe tried the Sassano (essentially a Reuben), the Fredo (a Italian sub), and two \""New World\"" pierogies--the Southwestern and Buffalo chicken varieties.  Not a misstep in any of them. The in-house bread, corned beef, and kraut all made the difference.   Both pierogies were also outstanding.  The Buffalo chicken pierogies were made primarily of white meat, but remained juicy and tender.  \n\nWe also enjoyed samples of both the spinach&feta and pepperoni doughbies while we waited.  The spinach&feta was a bit sweet--not quite the flavor profile i was hoping for--but the pepperoni doughbie was excellent.  Definitely a step up from the omnipresent Pittsburgh pepperoni roll.\n\nI was also excited to see that a fried egg could be added to any sandwich for a buck...nice touch.\n\nThe one downside of the place--an aspect I might not have noticed if I didn't have so many vegetarian/pescatarian friends these days--is that almost every item on the menu contains meat.   \n\nNevertheless, although our veggie friends might not be joining us, we'll definitely be going back soon."
40577,3,"Wow, this place is awesome!  I'd heard about it a couple of months ago and my wife and I finally went last Saturday.  And then the next day.  That's how much we loved it.  It's a quaint, cozy place to get some coffee and relax.  Their cinnamon roll was great, especially the frosting!  The waffle sandwich with the Bechamel might be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had.  The second day we went we took my wife's cousin Johnny and he loved the sandwich as well.  We are making a resolution to go to Bread and Butter every Saturday, or at least every other.  I definitely recommend it for a nice breakfast and I'm excited to try the lunch sandwiches."
27521,4,"all I can say is WOW\n\nYou need to come here, seriously, it's amazing.\n\nYolanda, the owner, is nothing short of brilliant. So creative, so meticulous with her presentation, so fun and energetic, so lovely and so nice!! She is so professional and it shoes in her parlours.\n\neleven out of ten!!"
46180,0,"I'm not one to slam a service, especially if I haven't used it, unfortunately here's my experience. I called Insectek becuase of everyones' 5 star comments on Yelp. I was calling for a quote. I told the owner that I had brown dog ticks in the backyard and some in the house on the dog beds. He asked for my address (Arcadia) and the size of my home and lot. I told him 2400 sq. feet, and the lot I wasnt sure of but that it was around 3,500 sq. feet. He quoted me $700 for the size of my property for outside and inside treatment (visiting a total of 3 times in a 30 day period so every 7-10 days or so), then the bi-monthly service would be $68 every 2 months. It sounded expensive. He told me that it might even be more than that depending on how hard it would be to get to the ticks and the size of the property and conditions... I thought to myself hummm... that ounds odd. He said that they charge a normal price for how long they stay to do the work and treat tthat they would do my carpets as well. Not the entire carpets but the very edge up to the baseboards on all areas of each room as well as the corners and any crevices that may be on top of the baseboards they would spray in. It sounded very thourough. He offered to have Lucio come out to give me a firm quote 2 days before my appointment bc i ne. If you click on their website from the yelp add on the right hand side you will see that you get 50% off your initial treament... I asked the owner about that while I was on the phone and he said that has nothing to do with treating ticks and that its entirely different and a different process... so there went that discount. However, it doesn't say that on the website. Oh well, I set the actual extermination appointment for this Friday at 10:30 am, I arranged my father in law to watch the house while I take the kids out to the park and lunch waiting for the chemicals to dry. I told him that It was still good for me to know the firm quote though so we arranged for Lucio to be at my house at 12:30pm today (Wednesday). Mind you, I have called 3 other companies since my convo. with the owner of Insetek. They have all quoted anywhere from $200 to $300 for the extermination and $45 to $50/month after for upkeep. I was starting to get the vibe maybe I was over quoted but I didn't call to cancel my \""firm quote\"" appointment with Lucio just yet. I wanted to see what Lucio had to say about why it was so much money upfront for coming 3 times the first month and higher on the monthly side, with no guaruntee if it didn't work... also maybe there was some magic potion they used on brown dog ticks that I had never heard of, so I wanted to give them a chance based on the reviews. He arrived, yes he's very nice, and friendly and calls you mam and shakes your hand is well dressed and wears booties... but the second I asked him about what chemicals he was going to be using it threw him for a loop. He was off his game. I told him that I just wanted to know the names of them and the gallons he was going to use on the size of my property and about how long it would take. He stumbled on his words, told me that the office could email me that kind of thing and that he would just walk the property and see. I also told him before he walked the property that I had gotten 3 quotes since my phone call with him and that they were sooo much less and I was just curious why. He asked me how much and I told him.. He hopped on the phone and called the owner while he was outside. He came back inside and said that he would charge $500 if I did the bi-monthly service for $68 a month and wanted to set an appointment. I told him that I already had an appointment for 10:30 am on Friday and that I would see him then after he could somehow get a list of chemicals that were to be used on my exact property and size.... He said, well I filled that spot since you needed a firm quote first so we need to reschedule and we need to do it tomorrow. He said he would provide a list of chemicals. I was not feeling too great about things becuase they just lowered the price randomly... at that point I had a feeling this wasnt the right place to do business. My gut was telling me that I should cancel by the end of business today and go with another company. What made things so obvious that this is a shady company is that Lucio stayed in his car in my front driveway for 10 min. talking on the phone, I was on my phone as well calling the other companies to see if they could give me an idea of what the exact names of the chemicals they use are called to see what they are called. Just then Lucio walked up to my door and rang the doorbell. I opened it up and he said, \""The names of the chemicals are Temprid, Suspend, Bifred granuals.... but we don't usually do this. Will you be keeping the appointment or no?\"" Cancelled. Nice guy, bad business play. Expect the unexpected. Never expect a sale."

44230,1,"I agree with Nicole's comments.  Stopped in today (10/10) and tried two different flavors - carrot and lemon.  Both were dry - I've had better tasting ones from a box mix - and the icing was overwhelming in quantity, underwhelming in taste.  If you're only going to offer one commodity, you need to make sure it's outstanding, and unfortunately, these cupcakes weren't even close."
23830,2,"Food was standard Chinese fare. The wonton soup is very good and worth the upgrade.\n\nWhen I went, they seemed short staffed and overwhelmed. Had a long wait between wait staff visits. Place needed cleaning from an apparent lunch rush."
18767,3,"Stopped off here a few times when we were over in the area. They are always quick and efficent with moving through any lines. The staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nThey even were kind enough to fix a drink for me when we stopped through after going to a different Starbucks close by that messed up my order in their drive-thru and we were gone before I tried it (too hot to try right away). The cashier was very nice about it.\n\nOverall: A\nGreat staff, quick to move things along and clean."
11173,0,"Food Poisoning. I used to love this place. Perhaps their good reputation made them complacent? Perhaps there are too many items on the menu (over 100!) for them all to be made fresh? Whatever the case, I ordered my favorite, Beef Mole Enchiladas, the center was a bit cool, but I plowed through it. Also had the fried ice cream- this was pre made, not fresh, horrible, this tasted old. I awoke at 3 AM shivering with flu-like symptoms. It gets R rated for horror from there. Never again."
32512,2,While Think produces excellent products ... Time is money - and they are always wasting mine. I've worked with them several times in my efforts to support local business but they have never hit a deadline. I've waiting in their office for prints that where quoted to be ready 2 hours previous. If your on a schedule I don't recommend Think. Very frustrating!
34429,2,"I really like this Thai restaurant.....it is close to my house and we have been loyal customers since their opening.  The owner knows us by name all of us, including the four kids! These little details make a difference!

27573,3,"My wife was itching for Korean BBQ and you'll certainly not get that on the Strip.  We debated between Sula and Wooche and opted for the latter.  We're very glad with our choice!\n\nWe thought the variety of meats to select from was very good (plenty of ribs, octopus, chicken).  Yes, you do grill your own meat but that's fine with us.  Good service of changing the grill after it got grimy and cleared finished plates.  Didn't care much for the \""cooked food\"" section.\n\nFor about $15, it was a great deal.  When we ate there, there was some \""dessert\"" with some fruit and the cold, sweet rice drink.\n\nTough reviewers here.  But I guess you have a lot of visitors from Los Angeles here.  Yes, this does not compare what you can get there but for Las Vegas, it appears to be among the best Vegas has to offer.  For that, I give it 4 stars."
25676,4,"Really good Sushi, all you can eat menu for 20-25$... pretty reasonable price if you can pack in 25-50 rolls of Sushi in one sitting. Ingredients are always super fresh, the caviar eggs are small and delicious, and the chefs do not get lazy and douse rolls with a mayonaise based sauce to make up for a lack of flavor. Definitely the best Sushi place on the West Side, although there might be some better deals east of downtown that merit a look."
34147,4,"Have to give this place five stars.  Menu is great, value is great but the cook Jose is the best.  Great customer service, really knows how to treat a customer.  He gave me a sample of the Greek fries yesterday and they are out-of-this-world good!"
47328,3,"Every time we come here the store is immaculately clean!\nAnd they always have something interesting to watch on TV. which is great for me while I'm waiting for my husband to get cut, they also sell the pomade my husband prefers, Layrite. \nSince moving to Las Vegas we have been to High Rollers, Elliot and Co. another place (I forget the name) and this place. The first couple of times we came here he received a pretty good haircut. Wasn't the best he has had (we previously lived in Phoenix) but better than the other places we have been to in Las Vegas. \n(Especially when you factor in the wait time/inconsistency at High Rollers. And \""OK\"" cuts at other places).\nWe have only had one bad experience here, The last time we came, hubby was in a rush and ended up only getting his neck cleaned up, and the sides by his ears, the guy doing his hair didn't understand what he wanted which I thought was pretty simple. One side looked clean and the other looked untouched. The guy also cut him, he had a long thick abrasive scratch on one side of his neck that was bleeding when we left and stayed red for a few days. \nEven aside from the one bad experience, this place is pretty good.\nThe ONLY complaint that I could have about this place and why I gave 4 stars, is that the owner doesn't seem very friendly. Which can make you feel uncomfortable. I feel like every time we come here we've walked into a party we weren't invited to.\n\nOverall, it's more consistent than other places at a decent price."
42263,4,"I want Yelp to establish some serious ground rules in regards to buffets.\n\nIf you're a woman and weigh less than 150 pounds and you're a man and you weigh less than 185 pounds, you are not allowed to write buffet reviews. Seriously. Maybe Yelp should include a \""Do you weigh less than 150/185 pounds\"" as an additional business tip when it comes time to review buffets. Hating on a buffet because you because you don't like the general \""quality\"" of the food is like a fat guy (like me) hating on a tapas restaurant because I don't like the \""quantity\"" of the food. \n\nMaybe Yelp should include a \""Do you weigh more than 150/185 pounds\"" as an additional tip if you eat at a tapas-style restaurant? \n\nEnough ranting. All I can say is that Golden Corral is a slightly more expensive, but higher quality (in terms of food) buffet than Hometown Buffet. I like Hometown's seating arrangement better with it's ample amount of booths whereas Golden Corral seems satisfied to be primarily tables to get the customer in and out. As with all buffets, only order water as a drink so you can chow down more and don't forget to bring cash to tip the bussers/drink servers because there's no option to tip at the register."

46130,4,"Oh, I'm coming back to this place!  My first experience with a noodle house.  The ramen was so yummy, not like the ramen noodles I had as a kid.  Now I wonder how I ever stomached that stuff. I guess when you're a college kid you eat anything.  \n\nLet's get back to Monta Chaya.  I let the waitress know is was my first time in such a place.  At this she thanked me for coming and made sure I enjoyed my experience.  I was torn between the salad and the bun appetizer.  I mentioned his to my waitress and she said she could give me just one bun so I could try everything I wanted.  For my main dish, I ordered the tonkotsu with the garlic oil and added nitamago. Oh it was delicious.  I do have to say that both the garlic oil and the nitamago both added a rich creaminess to the soup, maybe a little to much, but you've got to indulge every so often.  The noodles were silky smooth, not your dehydrated ramen."
24754,3,"The bar tenders are always super nice and friendly. I've eaten at this location about ten times, and the food is yum. However, I feel as though it is overpriced for the quality of their food. I usually eat in the restaurant, but the one time I ordered curb side to-go, they messed my order up."

When the waiter got around to us he was complaining that the kitchen was all screwed up and they did not have enough wait. He didn't apologize, buthedid say it would be awhile before we saw our food  the next time we saw him was when he dropped off our check and he asked if my steak had been cooked properly. I said that it was a little under done and his response was that he had been getting complaintsthatthesteaks were overdone. Skip the place. The food is not worth the headache."

13769,3,"So my second time in LV and i had never been to a buffet. I love food and I tend to not have very good self control so I steer clear from places like that. You know the kid in the candy store expression? Sadly that's me when I see food. Here is an example: I can eat pizza 24/7 if it is standing in front of me. I can tolerate the pain it gives me. So I was a bit nervous as there was so much potential for my ass to grow. But I figured when in it Rome, screw it and stuff your face, you are on vacation. Well I am ashamed to say that in 4 days, I went to 3 buffets. See? Zero self control. \n\nThis buffet was suggested by trip advisor as top 5 buffets on the strip. It was second following Caesar's and third was the Wynn one. \n\nWe went in and was told that the wait time was going to be bad. It wasn't all that awful. If you are like me and love people watching (and occasionally judging) then there was plenty of things to see and watch while waiting in line. We anticipated 1 hr and we were in within 30 mins. \n\nYou sit down and the servers come and get your drink order. Then u go and pick your food and thats where all your troubles begin. HOLLY CHOICES! There were 5 kinds of salmon, cooked in all sorts of ways. Calamari salads, pasta, pizza, veggies, mussels, shrimp, beef, chicken, ribs, sushi, chinese food, breakfast food, all types of bread, a whole section with fruit and another one with desserts. There wasnt anything that I tried that I didnt like. I went absolutely crazy on seafood and fruit that I couldnt even make it to the pizza section. I was beyond stuffed. Therefore I became the healthiest eater in buffet history. Only fish and fruit. Hey I am ok with that.\nThe only reason I deducted a star was because a few of the foods were cold. Otherwise, that place was every eater's paradise. Props to bellagio for even keeping up with the abundance food and people."

When calling the branch to ask for ATM reconciliation, nobody picks up the phone. If anybody has been to downtown Phoenix during the day, they would know only people at conferences are walking around that section of town so I couldn't imagine who they would be helping. After getting routed to their 800 line several times and being told to only the branch or my bank could start that process I decided to give them the ol \""call repeatedly until someone picks up.\"" After about 30+ tries, I reached a girl who told me only the phone support number could start this process.

I was just sent to the start of the 800 menu again. Was not able to reach anybody after another 10 calls, I gave up defeated but still victorious. Victorious in the fact I don't have a bank account with these unresponsive a holes.

I grabbed a slice of deep dish, and instead of warming it up, I went \""home on your parents couch\"" style, and ate it cold.\n\nSO TASTY COLD!\n\nI don't know how to feel about this, but the deep dish pizza was much better cold than it was fresh from the oven.  I noticed flavors I couldn't really detect the first time around.  I would recommend keeping a cold one on hand for when your little brother or brother-in-law comes to visit."
17717,2,"I'll start with the food. It was good. My husband enjoyed the steak and I got the halibut. Both really tasty. Baked potato was stellar and they have a 'wine of the month' which you can get for $20 or if you have the hotel coupon book, free.\n\nService. Was very attentive in some ways, non-existent in others. Served us drinks/wine right away. Never brought bread and we had to ask for our entree after being there about 75 minutes and then rush to make our show. Not a huge deal EXCEPT the server was super defensive about it and made excuses, which I thought was weird as we weren't irritable when we mentioned it, just asked because we needed to get out of there.\n\nSeemed super pricey for South Point too, but if you want a special occasion and are staying there - I'd say try it. It was good."
15941,4,"On Friday, December 10th, PhoenixBites.com had the honor of co-hosting an event with The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa.  Our media guests were treated to a muddling class, ceviche instruction and tasting as well as a delightful dinner and dessert.\n\ndeseo is located on the lobby level of the resort offering an enticing menu created by James Beard award winning Chef Douglas Rodriguez, regarded as the inventor of Nuevo Latino Cuisine.\n\nUpon arrival, we were escorted to the Muddle Bar.  The room is warm and dark, offering up a relaxing atmosphere largely due to the rich, warm wood.\n\nWe were presented with the Grande Mojito.\n\nOur instructor and mixologist, Monique Dias, was so enthusiastic and full of information regarding all facets of muddling.  It was not only an enjoyable experience, but an interesting history lesson of sorts.  Tasty too!\n\nWe were able to sample the Grande as well as the Berry Grande Mojitos.  While both were delicious and I rather enjoyed the introduction of fruit, I am partial to the original version.\n\nAfter our Muddling Course was complete we were lead to \""the rail\"".  The Rail overlooks the open kitchen.  I have to say, if given a choice of dining at a table in the main room or at The Rail, I would always choose the rail.  I couldn't imagine all the things you would be able to see on a busy night, not to mention the tips one could pick up just by being in the presence of these amazing chefs!  Chef Rodriguez treated us to an in-depth lesson in all things ceviche.  I was amazed at the amount of information that he knew and shared with us.  (I won't spill it all, since I really want you to check out deseo and The Rail and have your experience not be tainted by mine!)\n\nOur first indulgence was the Rainbow Ceviche, a beautifully presented dish featuring tuna, salmon and hamachi dressed with white soy, citrus, sesame seeds and pickled jalapeno.  In short - it was amazing and my hands-down favorite of the three ceviches of the night.  It was so fresh and light and the slight punch of the pickled jalapenos was unexpected yet welcomed.\n\nNext up we had the Lobster Escabeche which was a delicate ceviche served with avocado, chives, sweet aji and garlic chips.  This is not what you think of when you hear \""ceviche\"".  It was delicate yet rich.  Beautifully presented and a treat to my mouth!\n\nWe completed the trio with the Ceviche Mixto Clasico, full of lobster, shrimp, scallops, calamari, octopus, crab, red onion and an accompaniment of sweet potato.  What a decadent way to round out the tasting.\n\nPrior to being served our entrees, Chef Rodriguez spread some holiday cheer by treating all of our guests to a personalized autographed copy of his most recent book, The Great Ceviche Book, revised. This book will provide you a bounty of information and instruction as well as hints and tips to create an array of ceviches!  This was such a wonderful treat to our guests and we were blown away by his generosity.\n\nAfter we calmed down from the excitement, is was time for our entrees.  We were served a split plate of tender beef tenderloin and merluza sea bass and fideo.  The contrast of flavors and textures of these two dishes was complex and only lent to the entire experience of the evening.\n\nOverall - this event, having been our first to co-host - will be close to impossible to beat.  The staff was incredible.  Everyone was so helpful and friendly.  The atmosphere was lively, but not in a crazy Scottsdale Saturday night kind of way.  The food was impeccable and all the attention to detail and care in explanation made it a night worth repeating!"
40074,3,Yummy!!  Offered to let us take some peanuts to go.\n\nThe soda machines are awesome with 200 different types of soda combinations.  One of the soda machines broke while we were there so took a little longer to wait for the other machine.
17052,0,"Called ahead take out order. Stated I would be getting a smoothie when we arrived, but the woman taking my order forgot to tell me the smoothie machine was broken. As I'm consoling an upset toddler she is motioning for me to sign my cc receipt. Really, my hands are full, and my order is not even ready yet. Salad was soaked in dressing. Called back, yes all to go salads are served with dressing on them, so beware, you have to eat it ASAP or have a big soggy mess. (That's what I get for stopping at Jamba Juice on the way home)"
43615,4,"Great pizza. Get a regular pie well done, as close to NYC style as you can get. They have great daily specials as well."
10791,0,"Terrible customer service. I wouldn't mind the prices so much if the service wasn't so horrible! I've been in a few times.. And every time is the same. Ignored, until finally someone comes to help and I'm treated like I'm wasting their time. I guess the 1500$ specialized bike my mom bought just wasn't pricy enough to get some attention. Won't buy anything again.."
13985,0,"This place was so disappointing with their food, the service and even their decor. I had eaten here a few times so I was looking forward to eating here again and boy was it a let down. We ordered our drinks, I order a Tempranillo wine. I take a sip of it and it tastes just like vinegar! ugh. The waiter happens to walk by and hears me... He asked \""you don't like it?\"" I replied \""No, this tastes like it's been opened for a few days and it tastes like vinegar now.\"" He replies with \""Do you know what vinegar tastes like?\"" I looked and him and said \""Yes, just like your wine.\"" Needless to say he brought a new bottle to the table and had me try it before pouring a glass... what a difference! It was yummy!\n\nNow onto the flavorless food! Two of us ordered the tortilla soup. It was cool how they poured the broth into a bowl that had all the ingredients. However maybe this is why it lacked in flavor... it didn't have time to marinade. We added all kinds of items, salt, pepper, salsa to make it taste better! The ceviche was so bland too... no taste of seasonings or marinades not even lemon which is what you mostly marinade the fish/prawns in. The mole con pollo should have been written \""Pollo con mole\"" cus it was all chicken and a small trace of mole. My friend ordered a side of mole and poured it in... added salsa, salt and pepper and then it was ok tasting.  \n\nThe service... lets just say our waiter was non existent. We were going to order a round of shots but he never came back to see if everything was ok or if we wanted drink refills. When he finally showed up we just asked for the bill. Never again."
15214,0,"I have never had such bad service in my life!  Came in to find the hostess on the phone for about 10 minutes before even greeting me.  Finally, I was seated hoping my experience here would get better.  Then the waitress was horrible!  What are the chances.  She didn't make eye contact, wasn't friendly....can't say anything good about her.  The food was okay, but after the terrible service, the food didn't matter.  I couldn't wait to get out of there!  That waitress needs to find another job where she has no contact with the public."
4198,1,"When we have been in the store, gotten water tested and purchased product, all was good.  We like that the business is locally owned, so we contracted them to come blow out our lines as our suction was depleted on the side inlet of the pool. The gentleman came out to our house, looked out our pump and set the handle and said that the pool lines didn't need blown out, it was just that our pump was too small. That was last August and we continued to have issues with the pool's side inlet so we called them back to see if they could take another look. The representative told my husband that it would be another $85 to have them come out. Considering that they kept our entire $85 from last time and did not do the job, we declined. We then went to Home Depot, purchased items that would allow us to clean our own lines. Surprise, surprise, there was a Hot Wheels car in the side inlet that was blocking our lines. We knew there was something in there and we were right. \n\nThe store is fine, the products are well priced, but their customer service when it comes to the service we bought for them to blow out our lines was unacceptable.\n\nWe won't be back. Leslie's is closer anyway."
46984,3,"Try the paloma! From the people who brought you Bramble, there is a new kid in town. Lovely little place on Queen street where they choose your cocktails for you based around what you like drinking.\nWe all loved our drinks and the service was great"
10197,2,The employees spend too\nMuch time with there backs to the customers talking amongst themselves instead of focusing on providing better service!
1733,4,My absolutely FAVORITE place EVER!! Seriously I've been going to Houston's concept restaurants since I was a teenager and this along with all the others never disappoints. The Hawaiian Ribeye is melt in your mouth delicious and I dream about it... seriously! Service is always amazing (especially Tom at the bar) and I am full and happy every single time I leave! If it was just a tad bit less expensive I would be there weekly but unfortunately it is a once every couple months type of place for me. That's ok though it gives me time to miss it!
9538,1,"I remember having a great experience at the Mandara Spa a few years ago so I decided to make an appointment for a massage during a recent voyage to Vegas.  Unfortunately, that experience didn't happen this time around.\n\nMy Swedish Massage was $115.00 for 50-minutes but with a 20% service charge added, it came to $138, which is not bad.  My massage therapist was great, he had me sample the different oils that they use and asked about target areas.  Although, he didn't work on those target areas longer than I had hoped, it was a nice massage.  One thing that irked me little was when he used his arms on my back, I could feel his arm hairs, which kind of felt like sand paper but no biggie, it's a guy thing.\n\nThe spa itself has significantly gone downhill.  The lounge area used to be a little more plush, with nice seating and furnishings.  Now it has three microfiber couches, a coffee table and a side table holding a huge 32\"" tube tv and a VCR...yes, a VCR.  Their beverage station offers lemon water, hot tea and in the mini refrigerator, there's a bunch of mini cans of juices, but no bottled water.  Apparently, they keep the water behind the counter.  Hmm...doesn't juice cost more than water??\n\nThe sink area offers your basic amenities, nothing fru-fru that's for sure.  It almost feels like the sink area at your local gym.  You know, kind of stale and industrial feeling.  The restroom area is out in the open so you can hear (and smell) everything.  The showers are in a separate room/area, which is very dimly lit, but the shower stalls are private.\n\nThe hot tub is pretty huge and can fit about 22 people, so the sign says.  But it looked quite dingy and could certainly use a good scrubbing.  The cold plunge is the size of a normal hot tub and was quite cold!  In the same area were the Sauna and Steam Room...which smelled mildewy, nothing minty or eucalyptus smelling like it should be.\n\nThe spa staff was alright, they were on the young side, just out of high-school type.  So, they were nice but, not quite refined for the atmosphere.  One of the guys who I thought was restocking the refreshment area, was actually standing there and texting until I glanced over at him.\n\nMandara or Paris needs to revitalize this spa because with all the other awesome hotels and super duper new awesome hotels around them, they're just going to fall way behind."
47684,2,Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.
24715,2,"In the fast food sandwich market there are many choices based on taste and your pocketbook. Take Jersey Mike's for instance. They are an east coast brand that has been making it's trek west for a few years now. On a recent visit I ordered their Original Italian w/ extra meat and a small soda which came to $12.29. The sandwich was very tasty and came on a 8\"" or so size sub. \n\nI've tried various Jersey Mike's along the west coast and they are all uniformly good, Ray Kroc would be proud.  What makes Mike's unique is the grilling of your meat for you Sub.  They have both a Philly and Hawaiian options, etc. \n\nThe quality of the meats and sub bread seem above average as the prices reflect, but still a good sub!  \n\n***Don't forget to ask for the \""stamp card\"", so you can record your visit ***"
17250,2,"Pasties are good, yes? The service at this location blows. Who wants to drive all the way to Mesa, though?"
47132,4,"This chocolate shop is quite simply the best, and a must visit not only for yourself (yes they give free samples), but also any special person in your life that you can't figure out what to get, but your present needs to say that they are simply worth and deserving of the best!\n\nFor those not in the know, Belgium chocolate is the best bar none. Yes, that right better that Swiss, German and even my favorite English, but that's only because I'm British and grew up on the stuff. That said, any serious European will tell you that Belgium chocolate is the best and what you buy for that special person in your life whether it's your spouse, mother, grandmother and/or any man or woman that you need to impress.\n\nHeads up, they currently offer a 5 percent discount off your next purchase with your receipt. Also you can have dinner at 5th and Wine around the corner as their chocolate is on the dessert menu. I recommend eating fast, because you are going to want to get more chocolate before you head home."
8357,4,"Checked in here while in town for a wedding. From the time we walked in the door to the time we checked out we had nothing but the best service from the extremely friendly staff. The room was always super clean, the bed was comfy and the pool area was really lovely. I would recommend to anyone staying in the area."
29180,1,"We are a family of 4 with two small children and had my brother visiting. Most high-end Montreal hotels accept up to 4 guests per room even for suites. I had a hard time finding a room for 5. This Westin was the only one that had a suite with two double beds and a sleeper sofa for 5 guests. The room was spacious and nicely appointed, but came with a high price tag. Although they charged for the 5th person, there were only 4 sets of bedding and towels. The sleeper sofa had crumbs of chips and other junk food under bottom cushions. The room was never made the next morning. When we requested extra bedding and the room be cleaned, nobody came for 30 minutes. Concierge hesitated to recommend restaurants frequented by locals and not by tourists and insisted on going to canned places on the map. The highlight of our stay was the swimming pool. The bottom of the pool can be seen from the hotel entrance on the atrium ceiling as if it was a fish tank. There were 3 pools - a heated one for swimming, a large hot tub and a tub with cold water. That made our kid's weekend. Gym looked very nice, though we never used it. We stayed at many nice suites at other locations within similar price range and always had a wonderful time. We expected a lot more from a reputable name like Westin for a higher end room. That said, it's a nice option for business travellers. I wouldn't recommend it for family weekend away."
8373,2,"From St. Louis? Missing your IMO's Pizza? Then you need to go here for your Pizza fix!\n\nI recently had family visiting from St. Louis and was told we need to check out Frasher's. \n\nDecor/Atmosphere: If you've ever been to a Ma & Pop Steak House in WI then you'll feel right at home. It's a pretty dark and old with some huge circle booths surrounding the table. There is St. Louis memorabilia all over the walls. \n\nService: ehh - we probably had to wait about 15 minutes from when we placed our drink order to when we placed our food order. She was friendly and knowledgeable but would have loved to see her a little more often....\n\nFood: If you've never tried the St. Louis style pizza you really should! A thin crust pizza topped with the amazing Provel cheese and sausage. It's much higher priced then good ol' IMOs back in Missouri but I'll pay the price to get it out here in the valley. The toasted ravioli was among the best I have ever had. The loaded potato skins were loaded with pretty much loaded to the max - a little loaded for my taste with cheese, onions, bacon, black beans, and I'm sure a few other things that I'm forgetting (I'd personally prefer TGIFridays). I ordered the Provel Chicken Sandwich because it had provel in the name - meaning I should love it. I was pretty disappointed with the sandwich though. The fried chicken was a little tough to bite through but was moist on the inside but there was a severe lack of provel cheese from what I was envisioning. The complimentary bread served with some flavored butter is pretty awesome though!\n\nIf you're from St. Louis they have the book for you to sign and of course write down which high school you went to.\n\nSummary: Go for the pizza, bread, and toasted ravioli."
27108,2,"Discovering a new place can be deceptive - the first time you've gone in, it's with a sense of expectation or mood that you're carrying.  So, for example, when I first came upon Patisserie Florentin, I was in a sad mood, and it's yellow walls, sunflowers, and wee back room with framed window facing onto a sun-filled walled garden was altogether a bit magical.\n\nIf going back knowing what to expect, however, it's altogether a different story - you have a reference point for disappointments that occur again, like the one member of staff who is so lovely and polite and with such a lovely smile that the others seem sullen, not just curt, in comparison.  You notice that the service isn't great on your second visit and remember that last time, it took quite some time to get your order taken, and more time to get the bill.\n\nAnd you start to notice the other things that you either really do quite like - the pastries and bread in baskets on the wall and the overall French feel you do get from the cafe if not always from the food - and the things you aren't so keen on - the one or two members of staff who seem pre-occupied with anything but serving customers and the slightly-warmer-than-tepid coffee.\n\nStill, Florentin does have atmosphere - maybe that's something that you bring with you, but at least a little of the welcoming sunflowers also rubs off."
48588,2,"Grassroots was an enjoyable experience.  Good food, good service and nice decor. I had the grilled shrimp and jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits.  The grits were the best part.  My wife had the tuna steak with heirloom tomatoes. Heirloom was the best part.  It was one of those places that there was not a bad part of our meal, but nothing to rave about and make us want to come back to soon."
27200,4,This place is amazing value for money. The cocktails are delicious and the staff are very friendly and genuine. Everything I have had to eat here has been good. The risotto is so tasty. The fish and chips are spot on. The salmon I had here was awesome. \n\nGreat place for smokers as there is an outside area which is very pretty. The whole place has high spec chic decoration and is very clean.\n\nI have nothing bad to say!
28765,2,"beautiful architecture!! \nthe view of aria after valet parking was breathtaking\nstayed from friday to sunday - hotel is not operating at 100% yet.. still have technical difficulties\nroom didnt have pens.. towels were so new or cheap the lint rubs off on skin, the guest service and room service menus were EMPTY, phones didnt work - had to use my cell to call for services.. \nvery high tech room\nwe didnt get our booked 2 queen room - only king bed available \nhotel has a vanilla scent as soon as u enter.. somewhat better than cig smell.\nits a nice place - just need to get the kinks out"
39932,3,"I'll admit...every since Presto Cafe moved in next store, Russo's has not gotten my love nearly as much as it used to. Coincidentally, I've also cut down my carb intake so that is part of the reason (cheaters always try to justify their actions, right?). \n\nI love the feel of Russo's. It is a family run restaurant that treats their customers like friends. It had been at least 8 months since my last visit, and I genuinely thought the staff remembered me. That is always a nice feeling. \n\nOn this trip, I went with my usual, fettuccine alfredo and a side salad. I love the side salad. First, its massive and easy to share. Second, the ranch is incredible. I don't know if they make their own ranch, but if not, I'd buy this stuff by the bucket. I also got garlic cheese bread which is always a winner. \n\nI am glad I ate here for lunch though, because of my lack of excess carb intake, I was ready to sleep by 3pm. It made me remember why I don't eat here very often, but not because of the food or the service. I just can't get away with falling asleep at 3pm. \n\nIt can be tough going back to an old flame, especially when the new one is right next door. But when that old flame treats you well, you cannot say no."
20732,0,I will never go back here ever again. Not only is the service here incredibly slow but the staff acts like every customer is a nuisance. I have been all over the world and this was the worst customer experience I have ever encountered. The way I was treated tonight this place is lucky its still open. Only people that would enjoy this place is if you enjoy sober ignorant racists and that is the straight up honest truth if you find yourself there from the hours of 9 pm till close
29142,4,"The wine here is amazing! If you are not a wine person, your choices are limited but you can still find some good beer. I'm not a big bruschetta fan, but get it with salami and pesto!! Its to die for!!"
34784,3,"I have been coming to this location since it opened years ago and the only thing I can really complain about is the green tea latte.  Most times it's good but twice I have gotten it with the Matcha powder clumped in the bottom and clogging the straw. Not much grosser than drinking your tea and getting clumps of powder ever few seconds. Other than that, they are quick and its always clean."
44251,0,I ordered the squid salad from this place.. And I was throwing up all afternoon.. Don't eat here if you want to spend the day healthy and happy
1588,0,"My boyfriend and I traveled an hour on Thursday to come to your store based on the reviews and advertising of your business. We ordered two sandwiches, one Italian sub, and one sandwich with mortadella only. We also bought the imported Parmesan Reggiano cheese, a jar of hot cherry peppers, a package of the imported long ziti, 1/2 lb of Hot Capicola and 1/2 lb of Mortadella totaling approximately $80.  We are from NY and have Italian in our blood. We are used to good Italian delis in NY.  Yours doesn't even come close.  I should have realized when there was no smell of cheese when we walked in. The sandwiches were ok, we ate them there. Your store was very clean, not sure if that is due to lack of business or what. When we got home, my boyfriend tried the cheese, he said it was tasteless.  I just made a sandwich with the hot cherry peppers, however, I noticed that the jar cap was popping, which means it's been opened. I tried them anyway and they are tasteless!  Your prices are very high and then to have tasteless cheese and cherry peppers? I told my boyfriend we should come back to your store and demand a refund for the cheese and peppers, which was about $40!  But how much gas are we going to spend traveling back to you?  The proper thing would be to credit his credit card.  Hopefully, you will see this and do that."
49076,1,"Granted we arrived at 2pm on a Saturday and granted we expected there to be a wait....but oh boy, was there a wait!!  We were number 71 and they were only on 40.  We got lucky soon after when someone gave us their number 57!  (They had had enough and said, \""that's it, we're outta here!\"")  So from 40 to 57 was an hour.  Ok we waited, no biggie.  \n\nA few points:  \n--the place is small and it's so crowded that you will not be able to look at any display cases without pushing/shoving your way to the front.\n--there is bar next store where you can get a cocktail while you are waiting although not sure if you would be able to hear them calling numbers.\n--the cake itself was a grocery store cake for all intents and purposes--good, but nothing special whatsoever and definitely not worth an hour plus wait in chaos.\n--the cake was $28, which is well above grocery store prices, but cheap in comparison to real authentic bakeries.  \n\nWe gave into the gimmick and glad we did.  It's a new Vegas sight--not a must have in terms of cake, but put it on the list in case you are ever there with kids.  It's now checked off the list--one and done."
922,2,"generally okay place, a little overpriced for the settings:(  noisy and place is too small, not looking very neat... food portion is below average. maybe not again."
1058,0,"= = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  :-O  = = = = =\n\nOk, the old Hotel San Carlos here is serving a weekday lunch buffet, so of course I stopped in to try it.  Today was Mexican food day, & they had a small setup of 16 items, which might be ok as long as the food is good.\n\nI started with some of what they said was Tortilla Soup, in a styrofoam bowl.  Next, there was a bit of salad, & then it was on to the refried beans, which were cold, tasteless, & the consistency of the clay we had back in grade school.  They also featured nearly tasteless chimichangas, enchiladas, & tacos.\n\nOver at my table there was a pitcher of WARM water to drink!\n\nThe service was awful, & so was most of the food.  Factoring in price ($7.99), it was worse than Taco Bite!     :-O"
45043,2,"I would start by saying after having Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill I was looking forward too trying Gordon Ramsay Burger. Thankfully my cousins visiting choose different Gordon Ramsay. I was not disappointed but neither did I get wowed or impressed with the food. If not for all the Gordon Ramsay name sake all over the restaurant strip it down without it. It clone of Bachi Burger even down too the way serves the fries. I had the Hell Kitchen Burger. Solid burger it cooked too perfect medium, nice moist and juicy inside. I enjoy the combination of the cheese,, roasted jalapeno, avocado, and over roasted tomato. It had that nice little heat from the jalapeno overall solid burger. I had the truffle fries that was good. I felt they could have mixed the seasoning especially the truffle oil or whatever they do better throughout the fries. I felt times that fries bottom had no truffle flavor. The dipping sauces was solid. Dessert try the sticky toffee pudding push up pops. My cousin and I split since it came two pop ups. I did LOVE the presentation of it. It literally looks like old school pop ups ice creams remember getting from ice cream truck on the street. But say in food presentation makes the first impression but if the food not stand up then all for not. I totally feel about it. Plus after the sticky toffee pudding NO WAY it could have competed with the one at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill. I felt the cake itself very bland nothing stood out with it. The ice cream between layers nothing special and overall dessert that waiter pushed hard felt let down. \n\nThe service was great! I love the energy we got from our waiter. He was very informative. They also have the Ipad touch screens for there drinks just like the Pub and Grill. I liked different approach with the menu on top of the napkins and just style. The menu is straight forward same as Bachi Burger just burgers, friends, apps, shakes, other non burgers, and desserts. Surprise considering its the STRIP property and big name but prices were reasonable. If remember correctly Bachi and here average burger is in $15 range. The hostess wonderful, friendly, and start you off great experience. \n\nThe one thing that aggravating is too find it. The signs NON of them in Planet Hollywood directs too it. Not that the layout of the casino helps one bit. It next too PF Changs or say around the corner. \n\nOverall it was cool knowing that just went too Pub and Grill then Burger. Now all I need complete the tirfecta is Steak. If urge for gourmet burger sorry but Bachi Burger my go spot! If on the strip not bad alternative."
1067,4,We saw Mary Poppins and three generations of us loved it- the show stealing was accomplished by the ensemble cast with this one. The star roles were also awesome but the ensemble scenes blew me away.
6666,3,"Old school, cozy supper club serving up a great fish fry and classic cocktails in Madison! \n\nMy dad and I went to the Avenue on a Friday night around 6:30-7pm for dinner. Parking was somewhat of an issue, but we found a street spot after a few minutes. Thanks to the swag bag from the Yelp Elite event at DLux, we had a buy one get one free fish fry! We only waiting about 10-15 minutes for a table, which was not bad for a Friday night (after reading other Yelp reviews). \n\nOur starters came out quickly. My dad ordered the clam chowder...yum! Large chunks of clam, no salt and pepper needed! My house salad with homemade blue cheese dressing was surprisingly good. Then the fish fry. Nice pieces of cod, the batter was crispy and delicious. Nothing too special about the baked potato or fried. My Brandy Old Fashioned was tasty and strong. \n\nI love the decor and the feel of the place. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other dishes!"
31692,2,"Decent venue.\n\nWouldn't be my top choice by far, but it's good as a first spot to stop by or a last stop.  I got flagged down by a promoter handing out wristbands out on the Strip earlier during the day.  He gave me some wristbands and ensured me that I would get reduced cover and a line cut. Females would get comped in...Ended up paying $20 cover (instead of $40) with some free drink tickets, so not a bad deal at all. We got in super fast, so no complaints.  Not a bad option at 2:30am!\n\nClub plays open format (mainly hip-hop) so if you or your group are anti-EDM, Haze would definitely be a viable option. Club has main floor and upper level tables. I didn't do bottle service here, so i can't comment on that. But Haze is managed by the Light Group, and I know they have great deals at 1OAK, so I'm thinking it's the same at Haze as well. Crowd here is similar to the one at Pure. \n\nI used up my drink tickets, but shots of Hennessy and Patron were $15 a piece. Just about average for Vegas prices. Club wasn't jammed packed, so it was easy to buy drinks.\n\nReally 3.5 stars, but I can't see myself going back unless it was a last club of the night option or I got comped in for free. Not bad, but theres so much more in Vegas!"
26217,2,"Lavo is really small but I love the little sink/bathtubs that line the hallway as soon as you get up to the 2nd floor (the club area). I only come here because we met this chick at Caesar's that promotes it and Tao. The last 2 times that I went, they have open bar so of course I was ecstatic! I mean, I had a great time for free although the type of alcohol you can get is limited. The music is OK....with the occasional old school ones where people leave and disperse from the dancefloor. Their go-go dancers are pretty hot and they have girls that bathe each other by the bar or something like that. Oh! And sometimes you'll see a midget slave walking around chained up to his fat lady master...hahaha! I swear!"
20761,2,"It seems like almost every casino has a center bar.  Sometimes it seems like that's the most annoying bar in the casino.  I ended up at the Lucky Bar at the Red Rock this Sat. and I actually had an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe lighting and decor is perfect.  The sound system had awesome acoustics, the plush red velvet seats were comfy, and it wasn't too crowded.  The Lucky Bar would be the perfect place to grab a drink before or after a show...I like it!"
35736,0,"My husband and I love to try new pizza places. We went a few days ago to Naked City Pizza Shop and paid $45 for a salad, appetizer, and two 12\"" pizzas. We were hesitant, but we decided to give it a try... The crust was horrible!... I don't know what they're doing, but it tastes like frozen pizza.\nThe pepperoni is so small and looks odd. We won't go there again. The food is bad and overpriced."
7289,2,"I haven't been in a QT in years.  Mostly buying Chevron gas and when the desire arises buying stuff in their convenience stores.  They must be doing something right here as the place is packed every time I go by.  Going inside they definitely have a system for hot and cold snacks.  A whole row of coffee urns, another for hot dogs and such. Two cash registers, each working two lines.  They have taken getting people in and out seriously.  I'll probably stop in again for a snack just to get a better feel of what all is in there."
22670,3,"Not bad.  The format's pretty similar to Chipotle where you go up and order and pay at the register at the end.  The prices are a bit higher, but the food tastes better.  The chicken salad was huge.  The tortillas are freshly made.  The place is clean and spacious.  The employees are friendly too."
13643,2,"Date Attended: 11/05/14 (Carryout)\n\nItem Ordered: Delux Burger and Mixed Fries (my portion of the order)\n\nPrice : $18\n\nService: The staff allowed us to split the bill several ways for the five people that ordered carryout. Inside the restaurant,  the staff appeared very attentive to the guests.\n\nAtmosphere: From the outside, it looks like a very cool place to eat with the neon blue lights. The patio was spacious and inside was on the dark side. \n\nFood Quality: Here's where the ball was dropped. The burger was definitely on the greasy side as evidence by the accumulation of grease on the bottom of the takeout container. Interestingly, the beef patty was on the dry side. Despite this, I think I would return and try the Classic Burger, which is on a brioche bun (looks great). The fries were too thin (personal preference), but tasted great.\n\nOverall Experience: The atmosphere definitely shined more than the Delux Burger, but will return to give it another try."
4553,0,"I was there today and there was only one person running the store. After 15min trying to find what I needed with no help I went to the check stand and there was a former employee complaining with a store associate about how bad it was to work there and that she had quit her job there, and I just wanted to buy my stuff and leave but the only checker was busy with another customer. Point is there are people who really want to work for this company and do a great job, but when employers become picky and will only hire because of  your looks or your friends or employees with benefits, the business will suffer badly.  This Petco is dying a slow death because of very bad business practices. It wont do any good to contact the EEO about this, they just turn the other way. Sorry Petco you've lost my business permanently!"
9448,4,"Ok - I have a new favorite downtown!  REALLY great place.  Makes all the others pale in comparison.  Cool slide into a shark tank in the middle of the place.  And the breakfast was incredible.  Didn't really win any money gambling, but had a great time."
37890,2,Expectedly high priced drinks at this lobby bar in Cosmopolitan. I think one Moscow Mule was $16 with tax and tip included. I guess this bar is good for pre-partying or people watching. I just hate spending this much on drinks though?
47378,4,"I spoke with and got quotes from 5 roofers before choosing Brown Roofing.  I could not ask for a better job.  We just bought this house and it needed a new roof.  It has tile which we used to think lasted forever.  The tiles do but the 'underlayment\"" which is under the tiles, does not.  After researching I found that some companies lay 1 layer of underlayment and some do 2, and 2 is better than 1. It should protect the roof from leaking for a longer period of time.  Two of the roof bids I received only had one layer so I did not want to use them.  After speaking with Craig Brown of Brown Roofing on the phone I found him to be extremely knowledgeable about roof replacement.  He explained how the roofing process works and, after our conversation,  I felt confident we would have a good outcome with Brown Roofing.   He sent an estimate after seeing the roof and it was very reasonable. We arranged a date for them to begin work and they were there as arranged.  They made sure the roof replacement was done in a quality manner in every regard.  They even threw in a lot of extras and did not charge! The roof looks so much better than it did and I am confident it will be watertight for many years.  They made sure everything was cleaned up everyday  when they left and also when they finished and the yard looks great.  One less thing to worry about.  It is great to work with a company that goes out of their way to make sure you are satisfied."

New owners took over recently and are trying to turn it into a biker bar. \n\nProblem is the service has suffered significantly since the change. Slow, unfriendly, below average. Food has remained consistent, but no reason to put up with the decrease in service when there are 4-5 great places within 5 minutes. \n\nNew owners should take a breath and focus on what made The Garage successful enough to buy."

36670,3,"I'd say it's great but not the best. It has the large dance floor, the long bar, the tables for reservations, electronic music, the dark atmosphere with colorful lights - but what it's missing is a place for conversation in case you can't afford the tables. It needs an outdoor area with tables too. It's the classic club, when you think of \""club\"" this is exactly what comes to mind.\n\nWhat I especially like about this place is the crowd it attracts. Lots of of people in their twenties whereas many other places have older crowds in old town. Not a bad thing, just when you're in your twenties, that's what you want to hang around with. Also, there's a variety of ethnicities and there's a balance of males and females, another rarity in old town. \n\nSeems I forgot, there's also go-go dancers and hot staff!"

This place has quality food, made fresh and they actually care about the presentation!  I didn't think Chinese delivery like this existed.  No more ordering from the other guys!\n\nGeneral Tso's chicken on fried rice was awesome.  Next time ill ask them to make it extra spicy because it wasn't very spicy or hot at all.  Nonetheless it was freshly cooked and still crispy unlike every other time I've ordered delivery from the other guys.\n\nMongolian Beef on fried rice was good as well.  The meat didn't taste like it had been sitting around in sauce for several hours like most Chinese fast food.\n\nThe even have great service and fast delivery!  The guy who takes my order calls me, 'sir.'  I like this place!"
29187,0,"Since we got the \""Buffet of Buffets\"" 24 hour pass, we wanted to see which buffet we would like better. Online, it said Emperor Buffet had the best Asian food and sushi. When I got there, I was so disappointed. Sushi was just veggies rolls and nothing else. Asian food, yeah right, there was fried rice and chow mien. If you go to any other buffets, it would have the same items. They were closing...What kind of buffet closed for a couple of hours in VEGAS before opening for dinner. And when we got seated, our server told us we need to get all the food we wanted to eat b/c they're closing their kitchen in about 5 minutes. \nPlus the Emperor Buffet was upstairs away from the casino. It was a little hard to find. I would NOT recommend anyone coming here... should try the other harrah's buffets."

You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.

46482,1,"I'm really sad to say this was a major FAIL for me.  We came around 5:30pm on a Saturday night.  No one was in the restaurant.  There were 2 employees working, one cashier and one \""cook\"".  We ordered a BBQ chicken salad and an orange chicken bowl.  Also, the rumba fries.  I had a groupon so I paid 8.00 for 16.00 worth of food.  I had to pay 3 more dollars.  It took FOREVAH!! for the food to be served to me.  The salad was big, tons of lettuce and not that much chicken.  My spouse was served a teriyaki chicken bowl.  I said \"" this isn't what I ordered\"".  The cook said \"" Yes it is\"" and  I said \"" Nope, its not\"".  Spouse said she would just eat it.  After one bite, she says \"" taste this chicken\"".  I tasted it and it didn't taste like chicken, it tasted like pork.  I brought it back and said that I wanted what I originally ordered.  \n\nThat took another 10-15 min.  By this point, 6 other customers came in the the \""cook\"" was overwhelmed.  Ridiculous.   My spouse got her frozen, reheated chicken nuggets, drizzled with orange sauce and canned mandarin oranges.  She barely touched it and the overcooked fries.  No Thanks Rumbi Grill.  Wont be back."
22443,2,"i have heard that chef payards place here at caesars was amazing so i tried it out for brunch on my bday this year.  i must say paying almost 80 dollars for breakfast is a bit ridiculous. the bistro was really charming though. i liked the ambience a lot.\n\nthe eggs benedict of course was what i ate. and yes it was the best i have ever had. perfectly poached eggs.. the canadian bacon was good and their hollandaise sauce was everything i imagined. \n\nthe service was kinda blah. snooty waiters, but i expected that. i also went to the pastry shop. lots of amazing desserts but i settled for the french maccaroons.. sooo good!!!! \n\nso if you want a fancy brunch its a really cute place to go. but be prepared to pay extravagantly. its good but i feel like thier price point is too high for the product."
48031,4,"Love, love, love this place. The staff is so nice and welcoming but the best part is the variety of unique waffles. You must try the Maple Bacon Waffle and the Red Velvet (so yummy and to die for). \n\nI can't wait to return and try some of their other items."

22661,2,"This was my first stop upon landing in Vegas and I must say I think I hit the jackpot!  I enjoy Thai food and when at home I have my usual spots that I frequent when I need a Thai fix.  Visiting las Vegas always excites me not fprthe shows or the casinos or the nightlife mostly because of the diverse and unique dining experiences.  This was my first visit and It will not be my last.  Upon entry my eyes were treated to a visual feast of traditional Thai artwork and decor great attention was paid to detail and it showed throughout the dining room. The server was extremely friendly and gracious.  I ordered my go-to dish of yellow curry with chicken and rice. The flavors in this dish were all beautifully represented from the tender juicy white meat to the Milky spicy curry even the potatoes were perfectly prepared and melted in my mouth. I ordered a signature cocktail, the PP tea the cocktail was nothing special and frankly light on the liquor and heavy on the mixers. The bar took about 25min to prepare our drink, we were almost done with our meal when the drinks arrived. Overall I enjoyed the food and the ambiance I will return to try other dishes on the menu in the near future."

36743,3,"One of the best lunches we had in Vegas. Go Batali! We shared a Sausage and pepper pizza which was very delicious. But my favorite was his Capress salad! It was so addicting I kept thinking about it! The mix of pine nuts with the fresh juicy cherry tomatoes and pesto sauce blended with cheese (not mozzarella sorry forget what he used) was out of this world refreshing especially in Hot Hot Vegas! The we had a blend of Olive oil, almond milk, vanilla bean gelato. Can we say YUMMY, and yes maybe the Olive oil kind of sound weird but it was a light salty flavor which only just enhanced the other 2 flavors we selected. The servers were attentive, it seemed like we had two with a main one, but not overly friendly. Service was good until we got to dessert because I think the girl forgot to put our order in (oops). But nothing could deter our experience because the food was just that superb!"

I received an email for another bill that was still owe. They told me I didn't sign something. I said the employee never ask me to sign something. Oh well they are very unwilling to work with someone and are very RUDE!!!! I will tell as many people as I know to never use Lifetime because there service lacks any kind of common sense.
45519,2,"honestly, I don't think there is anything THaT great about this place. Worlds best waffles? I've made waffles just as good with a waffle maker in a college cafeteria ... they don't do anything special with these waffles either-the only option is to order one plain with a side of bacon.... I've ordered breakfast dishes here before and I'm pretty sure they make it taste good by using a lot of butter and salt. There is nothing else unique about how they cook the food... It is very run of the mill. If you are a fan of bacon, it's pretty damn good. The orange juice is Freshly squeezed and SO delicious, and for that I'll give this place 3 stars..."
27990,2,"I had been to the Breakfast Joynt once several years ago. It was not terribly memorable but there was a really great Groupon available on this particular day and the lunchtime crew and I were in the mood to eat out.  On the surface the Joynt seemed like it would meet all our lunch time needs. Close proximity to the office-check. Breakfast and standard lunch fair-check. Good pricing (especially with the Groupon)-check and check. After much deliberation with my lunchtime crew we headed over. \n\nAs soon as we entered we were greeted by a friendly gentlemen and we selected a table.The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, though the decor is a bit confusing (Chicago memorabilia plus Packers and Vikings stuff?)  I chose the egg salad sandwich and we all ordered. That's when things went downhill. Though our waitress was generally friendly, service was incredibly slow. So slow, in fact, that we overheard the table next to ours complaining about the same thing. Suddenly our \""quick\"" lunch break turned into something much less quick. \n\nOnce our food arrived we were all generally pleased. The food was tasty. However it had taken so long to arrive that we immediately asked for our check and fumbled for our wallets with one hand while eating with the other. \n\nOverall the food was fine, but the super slow service makes me wonder if this isn't a better place to phone in a to go order, rather than dining in.  Maybe we will hit this place up again when we are in the mood for a lunch hour that is a bit more leisurely in it's pace. \n\nPS-Avoid the ranch dressing. It will not meet your french fry dipping needs!"
7409,1,"I will start this review with saying that The Garcia on 35th Avenue is the only one you should go to.... this location was a huge disappointment...the only reason I give it a 2 star is because the service was good...our server was really nice, we had the tortilla soup, salad, and a grande burrito, I think... Let me start with the burrito...aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside, there was nothing to this... I think I make 100% better mexican food than this people, and I'm from Panama--LOL... now the soup, yak... horrible and the salad, had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it... my little one gagged... I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed."
42438,4,"Wow! If i could give them 10 stars i would !!!!! \n\nI was in Vegas with girlfriends and my sister celebrating her 21st.

However being the procrastinator that i am I called various bakeries a week  before  our Vegar arrival and they were all booked. THANKFULLY ANOTHER bakery reffered me to Sugar Bee's and Boy was i beyond glad with the exceptional customer service !!!!I \n\n i Spoke to (i believe her name was) Carrie and she amazing.. she was very patient and helped me with i placing my order over the phone, she was even kind enough to text me a picture of a previous 21st Bday cake she had done in order to get an idea of size and colors.  Amazingly enough it was a nice blueprint of what i was looking for.\n\n i described exactly what i wanted and they executed it perfectly!!!! \nWe were hving dinner at Maggianos and Carrie was kind enough to offer delivery to the restaurant.\n\nOverall i was expecting to pay over $100 bucks and it was about $76 with delivery included for a custom cake that feeds 8. The look on my sister was PRICELESS!!!!! \n\nThe cake was absolutely beautful and perfect. IF YOU ARE IN VEGAS FROM OUTA TOWN & CELEBRATING A 21st, or any other milestone and are thinking of getting a custom cake MAKE SURE YOU CALL SUGAR BEES YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!!! \n\nThanks for the awesome cake sugar bees!!!!!!!"

The man and woman working couldn't have been any nicer. \nMy husband and I both had the lunch special with Mongolian Beef. It was very good and I will be back to have it again for sure. I would have given a 5 star rating, but I also tried the won-ton soup and was not a fan. The won-tons were not soft enough for me. Usually, if I don't like something I will send it back, but the man who waited on us was so nice that I felt like it would have ruined his day if  I said I didn't like it. \nSo glad that we finally have a good Chinese food place in AJ! :)"

29908,2,"We live close to the Meadows Mall and got a Groupon.  We had not been to a Johnny Rockets since we went to one in So. Cal. many many years ago.  We tried to keep it near the $12 Groupon which was very difficult as the prices aren't cheap.  Ended up splitting a single burger, fry and large drink and still went over a buck ad a half.  Burger was very good, not overlooked.  Fries were o.k., a tad limp.  Free refill on the drink was nice. Lot's of competition out there in this price range, or cheaper.  Probably won't go back unless we can snag another Groupon."

42009,4,I was nervous to try this spa because we stayed at the Monte Carlo and the hotel really needs an upgrade. My room was gross. But any way the spa was very nice. I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nStaff was very friendly. Clean facilities. Has everything you need. The showers are nice private rooms. I got a signature facial and it felt amazing. Im 8 months preg and it took a while for me to get comfortable laying down but the therapist was very helpful offering extra pillows and moving the bed around for me. It ended up a very needed relaxing experience.\n\nI wouldn't stay at this hotel again but I would def recommend the spa

37003,0,"Truly disappointed !  The joint was nice but truly overrated by News 3 Wake up with the Wagners segment.  We asked for beef salad and squid salad. We were then asked by the server how hot 1 to 5 ( 1 being low. 5 being high). Well we asked for a 2   All the while , 2 customers sat after us and were served before us.  FAIL!!  When we got our order, the beef salad was perfect. The squid salad was at a 4 or 5 spicy level. We asked our server to take it back. She refused. Got stuck with it. No tip for her.  Will not be going back any time soon."
41615,1,"We were on the guest list, so that was the only reason I didn't give this place 1 star.\n\nMostly reserved tables for bottle service. That's how they make their money. A tiny dance floor.  Go Go dancers on raised platforms pole dancing were entertaining.  Another room of the club played older hip hop songs, which I preferred to dance to.\n\nWe left after an hour or so.  When we were walking out, they blocked the entrance because somebody special was entering. A group of people paraded behind these pretty girls who were holding light saber-thingys. It was almost cult-like. Or like when boxers enter the ring and they make a big production. Lame.  Didn't even recognize who they were."
39368,0,Are you in the mood for Chipotle?  Would you like to pay twice as much for half as much food?  This is the place for you!  It is absolutely not worth the price.  Chips and queso are $3.25 for a single serving.  To-go dishes are NOT microwave safe (found out the hard way).  At 8 pm I had to check the hours of operation because staff treated me like I was bothering them after hours.  Save your money.
40500,1,"Sorry to do this, Madtown Pizza, but the last few pies have been less than great. I'm sure many folks enjoy the copious amounts of toppings, but I'm afraid the crust isn't one of those that cope well with the massive quantity of sauce, meat, and cheese. \n\nAnd as others have noted, the toppings are quite greasy. This may sit well with the late night, inebriated crowd, but... you're not open beyond 9pm, and my stomach (and waistline) could do without the greasy sheen.\n\nIt's hard to write this update because I do enjoy the staff and I want to see a local joint succeed. Unfortunately, the results are what they are. Ease-up a bit on the toppings, firm up the crusts, and cut back on the oiliness and we'll be good. 2-stars is a bit low; I'd like to go 2.5 to 2.75, but I can't go with 3, especially based on the last pie from late April of 2014."
20312,1,"Really? This place is such a dated, throwback to 2003. The food is dated, the decor is dated- red and white pleather? They keep the lights really low so you can't see how dingy everything is.  The waiter kept bragging about all the celeb couples who have been there- Brad and Jennifer, JLO and Ben Affleck- and I'm thinking \""how long ago was that?\""  Is that the last time this place was \""cool'?  This is NOT fine dining.  Guy Savoy is fine dining.  Joel Robuchon is fine dining. Just sayin'..."
32411,1,"Let me start with a positive: the Cupcakery's red velvet cupcakes are phenomenal--moist and flavorful, and the frosting makes a perfect complement. A friend gave me one and I was excited to share this place with my boyfriend. Unfortunately, their other cupcakes were kind of a disappointment, especially for the price. For $3.75, I expect something pretty good, and a lot of it. Unfortunately, the cupcakes we bought were about the size and quality of the kind of cupcake you'd get at a grocery store--very dry, not much flavor, and the cream cheese frosting? Not as good on a coconut cupcake as the red velvet. The shop looked nice enough, and they were decorated fine, but not spectacularly--I think I could have done better, even with my meager decorating skills. If you happen to be passing by and really need a sugar fix, I say go for it, but otherwise not worth it."
19755,0,"Worst stay ever...! The place is newer built but the upkeep is awful.  The smoke alarms kept beeping and I had to call the front desk for them to fix them.  Well it turns out the batteries were dead...!!  I couldn't believe that a resort would not keep track of their maintenance issues specially in regards to their customers safety!!!  That was the beginning of our nightmare.  We got to the resort in the evening time the village was just very disgusting with the stench of sewer from what i could tell.  Like other have said the village is a ghost town and the stores that are conducting business are always closed from what I experienced.  They have a lot of empty commercial space available, that should have been a sign for me.....  I complained about what seemed to me was a truck running all night pressure washing something in the village and was told by the front desk \""we have no control of what the village does or doesn't do no matter the time of day\"".  I thought wow this place truly isn't worth of being in business!!!  Please if you want to relax and have a good time do not stay here...!!\n\nYou have been warned"
24546,2,"First time I've been in a \""Neighbourhood Market\"" WalMart. First impression was that it was very clean and neatly arranged (not surprising since it's only been open for a month or two). Second, I saw a sushi bar! There isn't much sushi around Surprise and while I haven't had their sushi, the rainbow roll looked pretty tasty.\n\nWhat I HAVE had, though, is the El Mexicano agua de coco (coconut juice) with pulpo (evidently adding an O to every word makes it Mexican). I'm addicted to it. Bought another eight cans of the stuff on the weekend. Also, they have small (Red Bull-size) six-pack tins of Milo in the mex section. Milo is sort of like Ovaltine and I'd almost given up hope of finding the stuff in Phoenix. Typically it's sold in powdered form, exactly like Ovaltine but with a very unique taste, but this stuff in the six-packs is premixed. Great as an energy drink for kids. Or adults.\n\nApart from that, this is just a cut-down WalMart without the extra stuff that I typically shop at a WalMart for - meaning that I'm probably only going to be here for sushi and agua do coconutto para drinko straight outto the canno. Safeway's closer to me and I got a crapload of coupons yet to be used there."
42289,4,"I've really been disappointed and burned in the past by a number of \""Celebrity\"" Chef's.  Morimoto, Lagasse, Colicchio, Wong...  All perhaps too distracted by their next TV show or book deal to maintain the standards that brought them notoriety. \n\nThis is so NOT the case with Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris on the Vegas strip. \n\nFrom the moment that I was greeted and escorted inside via \""the tube\"".  I had a feeling or perhaps sort of a cautious hope that good things were in store. \n\nBeing a fan, I ordered the Hells Kitchen Tasting Menu which comes with a take home menu and autographed picture of Chef Ramsay in a little folder. Pretty neat and we haven't even ate yet. \n\nBread was first to come out and the selection of four types of still warm bread gave the meal a huge head start (star-wise). Each was delicious. \n\nThe from there the meal was a big crescendo. \n*Scotch egg- perfectly cooked w yolk still soft. \n*Scallop risotto- perfectly seared scallop on creamy, just right risotto. \n*Roasted Beef Wellington-  My first Wellington!  And the high standard to which all others shall be held. Tender, moist, perfectly seasoned to accept the compliment of the demi-glace. (I believe that's the last time I use \""perfect\"" in this review. \n*Sticky Toffee Pudding- I'm not a big dessert guy but I've been having some stelar sweets this trip and the STP at GRS is ridiculously, plate-scrapingly good. Seeing it on TV, you can only imagine how good this is. \n\nPrime ingredients. Properly prepared and presented with caring and skill.  Served by by a staff that elevated a great dinner to a true dining experience. My server Donnie and the front of house staff did an awesome job. I truly felt welcome and at ease. \nThey really do a good job of taking the masterpieces created in the kitchen and presenting them beautifully. \n\nProps to the whole crew and congrats to Season 10 Hell's Kitchen winner Christina Wilson!"

6578,3,"Great on a Saturday morning when you're hungover from celebrating the 25th reunion with college buddies. Crazy Legs was getting set to start on the Capitol steps (damn healthy people). It set the stage for a late breakfast here at the Sunroom.\nBack in college, I must have walked past this place thousands of times. It's doorway and menu just a blip on the State Street radar. From the other side of the street, I'd see the place and think, 'Hmm, I should try that sometime' only to have my ADHD divert me to something shiny somewhere.\nWe walk up the stairs and stand in line to order at the counter. Smallish place, reminds me of a cafe. Chalkboard menu, just like a cafe. I ordered the huevos ranchero with veggie chili (that's the only chili they had) and coffee. Coffee was great as we waited for our food. I wasn't sure how to get more coffee once I was done. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to flag down someone, go up and poor myself, stand in line and pay for another cup. So I played stupid (perfected this move) and asked one of the workings girls as she passed by. She was nice enough to get me a cup. :)\nFood arrives and we dig in. I honestly don't remember much as I was hungry and hungover, but I ate the whole thing. I walked out of there feeling good about the day and ready for another night of celebrating. Starting with the Essen Haus at 3pm. Damn, I missed Madison."
28501,2,"This was our second visit to this restaurant and we were glad we gave it another shot because we weren't too crazy about our first visit.  \n\nWe had ribs the first time and we found them too smoky.  This time we tried the pulled pork sandwiches and they were really good.  The only problem was that the bottom bun was totally and completely soggy but the top wasn't too bad.  The pork itself was really good and I must mention the fries - oh baby!  They were so good!  Sometimes fries don't really taste like much of anything but these fries tasted like they just dug them out of the garden - they had that much potato flavor.  What a treat!  \n\nI agree that there are better barbecue restaurants around but this restaurant is definitely worth stopping at if you're in the neighborhood and have a craving for a pulled pork sandwich (with fries, of course)."
8891,1,"I have used irrigation with SPR for over 30 years. They have really dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful. The Zanjeros were always available and  ready to work out some water issue, and they  are varied and frequent (like a neighbors dead animal in a canal) . So for many years I have been a big fan of SRP.\n\nUntil today!\n\nI needed to pay my water assessment so I went to the main office.\n1. Now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place, no more receptionist.\n2. The payment  center was closed and turned into  a closet with some machines in it.\n3. Customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.\n\nZanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee Water Master system. Getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now. They are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day. The person responsible  for the Water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.\n\nWhen I called today I spoke to an old style SRP person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility, So no matter what the literature says SRP is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer."
44682,4,"I had The Dreamcatcher extensions put in my  hair by Stephanie, today..She did an amazing job. I have had other hair extensions before, and these are so lightweight and blend amazingly well.  Stephanie is great at what she does, and you can tell she is passionate about her job.  I'm looking forward to trying new things with my new length.  I highly reccomend Primp and Blow..Thanks, Stephanie!"
25949,3,"Scores is growing rotisserie chain that I've been visiting over the course of the last few years. The menu has changed over the years with a lot of new options provided. My favorite is the chicken and bacon focaccia and in the past it was served on a very fresh, huge ciabatta bread and now it has changed to a more.... economical style bread in both quality and size but still retains its grandness but what can one expect in Laval, land of the chain restaurants? \n\nTheir chicken is solid, so is their chicken tenders. I think I ordered their chicken burger once as well and it was solid. All in all, good grub, for a chain.\n\nHowever, their side orders beyond the average fries and excellent onion rings are pretty terrible. The rice lacks flavor, the vegetables (if you call them that) are stale, taste like processed food and probably are less healthy than the fries.\n\nThey have a salad bar for a few bucks more but I never bothered. Why eat salad at a Rotisserie? :P\n\nThe Pouding chomeur 'a la mode' is out of this world and a personal favorite as well.\n\nService is generally solid and you get taken care of. Refills are never a problem. The price tag is reasonable with a lot of options available during their lunches that don't hit your wallet too much.\n\nAll in all, a nice place to eat at, if you select things you know are good."

38017,1,"I do not normally write reviews but I am so mind blogged about what happened last night that I have to write this. \n \n(Pros: The Greek Salad and The Milo Special.)\n\nThe Greek Salad: It was surprisingly great! It was a mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and onions, that was accompanied by feta cheese and dressed with a vinaigrette. It was very delicious, if you like the tomatoes. If you don't, I would skip it. \n\nThe Milo Special:  At least this is what I think it is called. It was zucchini and eggplant that was lightly fried and had a yogurt dipping with it. That was the highlight of the night. \n\n(Meh: The Calamari and The Wine)\n\nThe Calamari: It was a little chewy. I didn't really care for it. \n\nThe Wine: It was sweet, but I could stomach it. \n\n(Cons: The Service/Staff and The Fish, The Atmosphere, and The Steak Fries)\n\nLet's Start with the food: The Fish was okay. It was basically red snapper with capers, lemon, and olive oil. It was okay, but I had better. It would be in the meh section, but it was 200 dollars. For 200 dollar fish, it better knock my socks off. Also,  it had bones in it. \nThe steak fries were awful. There was no seasoning or anything there and they were soggy. \n\nThe atmosphere: It was was so loud in this place. I couldn't hear anything. We had a large party and couldn't hear half of the conversation. It was very loud. \n\nThe service and staff: They were slow. We arrived at 7:30 didn't leave until 11 or so. Plus, when I asked them to explain a few items on the menu they couldn't adequately explain things to me. (that is if you can hear anything in this place) They are also business people. They like to deceive you here.  \nWe asked for water, they bring us bottled water that they charge 8 dollars a pop for. We asked for fish, they tell us that it can't feed a group of our size, and adds lamb, which is another 200 dollars. (I didn't eat the lamb that is why is it not on here). Its not the prices that were the problem, it was the fact that they deceived us and ranked up the bill. We had eight people and they added 18 percent gratitude on the bill which is probably why he was making a lot of the suggestions.  I rather you be upfront with me about the prices and let me make the choice if I wanted to eat there or not. This is the type of thing that is admired there, and it is a shame. I will not be dining there anymore. But needless to say, we were blindsided by the bill and took about 30 minutes to figure out, which they complained about. It was ridiculous. Never again will I eat there for some mediocre fish.  I had better fish for a 1/20 of that price. Real disappointment."
26532,0,"Don't waste your time of money.\n\nI came in to Vegas for a friend's wedding. I had planned on getting a leg and Brazilian wax before I left but my normal aesthetician had a family emergency come up and had to cancel. \n\nI figured that once I got to Vegas I could hit up the spa and get it taken care of without trying to figure out how to get to some of the places off the strip. I was staying at the Luxor and though the price was about double what I'd usually pay I went ahead and booked the appointment. \n\nFirst I was surprised to know that they booked both full leg and Brazilians for 50minutes each! Damn Gina! In 2 hours my normal girl can wax me from head to toe and leave me looking smooth as a baby! To make matters worse, the girl actually took closer to 2 1/2 hours. I know I walked in looking like Sasquatch, but I've never had a wax take so long. She was incredibly nice, and made me feel comfortable which I consider really important when someone is all up in my hooha. \n\nStrike two occurred when I noticed  (though not until the end of the service) that the woman double dipped. WTF? I can't believe that any reputable spa would allow that. \n\nWhen she was finished I had to rush to leave because I was meeting friends and was running a bit late. So the next morning color me disappointed when I noticed several spots on my knees and the back of my thighs where patches of long hair was left. This wasn't the new growth patches that can be difficult to remove, these were spots that were completely overlooked. I also noticed a thumbprint bruise on my knee and also some smaller bruises on my pubic area. \n\nWhen I called to talk to a manager she stated that I needed to file a report with security. I literally had my entire weekend booked from start to finish so there wasn't really time for that. Instead I sent her pictures of the bruising on my knee. She asked what I would like for her to do about  and I said that I'd like to get my money back. She gave me half back.\n\nSo I ended up spending $90 instead of $180. Better but not great.\n\nEspecially when you consider that the price for both services were $150 and the extra $30 was mandatory gratuity. I don't understand why they didn't just increase their pricing if they're going to mandate gratuity.\n\nDefinitely don't recommend this place, at least not for waxing services."
22095,1,"I had high hopes for Big Al's. We came here after the hockey game with 3 other people. We started off with a dozen oysters and I made the fianc\u00e9 share the combination pot roast. Oysters were very mushy, salty and not fresh at all....granted it is not oyster season, but it was pretty horrible to eat. Pot roast was ok, it reminded me a bit of the Chinese dish Shrimp with Lobster sauce. There was a lot of lil crab cracked shells in it, so beware. It was flavorful and minus the shells I think it's a decent dish. \n\nOne thing I do have to say is that Dolly is a wonderful server. Service was excellent and I might come back to give the clam chowder a try."
8059,2,"It's Olive Garden with a personality. Buca di Beppo, though a chain, has more than a few things going for it. \n\nThe Scottsdale location can easily accommodate large groups. Family style servings contribute to great interaction with friends and family. The d\u00e9cor is gaudy and creative, with an emphasis on Italian heritage and a touch of humor here and there. Gene Simmons on the celebrity wall? Generally friendly staff. Kid friendly (triangular crayons!). And the food is decent.\n\nAny negatives? The entrees, while solid, don't have the impact of a true fine Italian restaurant. On this visit we ordered the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. It was enjoyed by all. The Chicken Cannelloni and the Chicken Marsala were great. The Baked Ziti, however, was dry and far from flavorful. Three out of four isn't bad I suppose. And a single mistake is less catastrophic since everything is being shared family style anyway.\n\nWe had two children in our group and felt pressured to pop for the $4.99 kid's Cioccolata and Pisa Punch served in glasses with flashing lights in their base. The lids were poorly designed, subject to spillage around the straw, but the kids did enjoy the beverages. $10 of enjoyment? Well. At least refills were free. \n\nOrdering the right amount of food from the family style menu can be tricky. The portions are generous, so it's easy to order too much. For example, our server's recommendation to share a small salad for four adults was perfect, even though the written menu would have suggested the larger size. I'd recommend getting some friends together and ordering several small entrees for variety,\n\nI'd also recommend just letting kids share the adult family style entrees rather than ordering from the children's menu (unless they just have to have macaroni and cheese). The four and five year olds in our party were fine with it and it helped them feel fully part of the group. They weren't quite as supportive, however, when we refused to order the giant brownie sundae. I was willing, but..."
1740,4,"Outstanding memories of this place...Valentines Day 1999...Absolutely first class service, highly polished cooking, but very conscious of its Southwestern surroundings, this place still stacks up against the best. If you can deal with amusing and effete clientele (bombed-out Barry Goldwater Republicans) then Vincent's well worth the expense."
2281,4,"Ambassador Blinds helped me come up with an idea for my 20' wall of glass in my home in Mountain Bridge.  They installed Hunter Douglas motorized  shades (with a Custom built wood cornice) and a wireless remote control.  That was 1 1/2 years ago and my remote control stopped working a couple of days ago.  I called JoDell yesterday and he and Alfredo were at my house today with a replacement.  I had thought I would have to wait for it to be ordered, but they just swapped it out!\n\nThey also did a great job on my wooden shutters!  I highly recommend them for all your window covering needs!"
27697,4,"Oh...my...lanta! I can't believe I haven't visited this little gem sooner! It's nestled atop a Pei Wei and Starbucks so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But from the moment I walked up the dimly light stairway and into the bar, I knew it was going to be a great night.  So first off, they open at 4 and happy hour is until 7pm.  (20% off everything on Sundays!!). They have a huge selection of different booze and brews and their specialty cocktails are definitely something that sets them apart from other bars.  I loves me some Moscow Mule, so when I saw that they had one on the menu (in a real copper mug!!) I ordered one immediately.  It was so tastilicious that I had to order a second.  For my next drink, I tried the Retro Cooler, which in my opinion, is as cool as it gets...think Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.  It's a mix of St. Germaine (Elderflower liquer) with Champagne and a lemon twist.  It went down the ole' hatch super easy, though, so be careful!  The second time I enjoyed this bar I ordered the White Rabbit (no...it's not vegan and they don't have a milk substitute...I cheated!)  It has Godiva White Chocolate liquer, horchata, stoli vanilla and some other yumness.  This one tasted like candy and I drank it in about five seconds.  Anyway, besides the drinks, they also have a few light snacks like hummus, artichoke dip, etc.  The vibe in this place is super chill and I really dig the way the bar is set up; the backdrop has big circle cutouts with yellow lights behind. There are comfy couches and high top tables and of course seats at the bar.  I almost felt like I was going to see Shane and Alice from the L Word walk in.  On our last visit, it was pretty busy as it was a holiday weekend and there was a dj.  The people of SideBar definitely know what they're doing and I will certainly be back!"
1374,4,"Hanrattys is my go to dive bar. You cannot beat 2.50 bud and bud light drafts. Plus it is also an Ohio bar which I can enjoy. Not much of a crowd but it is a fun place to relax. \n\nThey have real darts and pool tables. So there is plenty to do. \n\nThe only downside, is the food. I have only tried one thing and that is the mozzarela sticks so do not try them."

430,3,"Considering I'm staying at the Hilton this week and working at the AT&T building next door, the Coffee Station is the closest java joint to get my caffeine fix in the morning and during the 2 to 3 PM lull.\n\nI must say that the several times I've been here so far, service has been incredibly friendly and they make tasty coffee.   I just had their breakfast sandwich and a large coffee this morning and the total for both was under 4 bucks.   Wow, really?   All I get for that at Starbucks is a lame scone.   And service here was far superior to the service I get at Starbucks.   The only thing I'll give Starbucks over Coffee Station is the quality of the coffee.     Still, me like very much."
30380,2,"I've passed Take a Break everyday on my commute, and I'm glad I finally took a walk over to it last night in the unseasonably warm weather. I have to say, I was surprised with what I found. Take a Break has great character with a fair share of pros and cons. \n\nThe pros: This place has massive mugs for beers on draft. I ordered a Blue Moon, and went with the large which is LARGE MUG. It was comically big and I'm glad I walked over. Did I mention it was under $5? \n\nWhen the weather is nice, the doors are kept open and there as a great breeze going through the bar. The space is surprisingly large, I had no problem sitting and watching a few games of pool. The place is decked out in Steelers curtains and was in full Halloween mode with cobwebs (assuming they were fake). I'm told the place can get a bit crowded on the weekend, but like I said, it's pretty big in there.  \n\nThe cons: Like most of the best dives in Pittsburgh, you can still smoke inside. I imagine this can get painful on a smokey night for an asthmatic like me. You will come out of here reeking of cigarette smoke. Also, they don't have much variety on tap--but that's coming from a self-proclaimed beer snob.\n\nIn terms of the dives around Pittsburgh, I find this one pretty approachable. I'm sure I'll be back again."
30890,2,"Yo tasty, yo tasty, yo tasty yo!\n\nTasty Yo has frozen yogurt that is all good for you and stuff, but it's only one flavor, and it can have that funky fro yo aftertaste, which sucks.  On that note, Yoforia is better.\n\nBut for toppings, I have to give the nod to Tasty Yo, both because they have some suggestions on the board which means you don't have to figure out what to put on your \""yo\"" (uh, well, I trust you know what I mean, yo?), and because they do it for you, which means that you don't have to deal with someone else's nasty hands digging into the bowls.\n\nThe other thing that is cool is the serving size is perfectly reasonable.  You get a bowl that looks about like what you'll end up with - even a pretty little swirl on top (think DQ).  Then they give you up to three toppings.  That's nice.\n\nAt Yoforia, for example, you get these bowls that are so big that you can almost bathe in them.  Then when you fill it up with everything you can, they weigh the bowl and you pay by the ounce, which means you need to take out a mortgage to buy your yo.  Yo.  So again, Tasty Yo wins.\n\nThe only downside is that the place looks like a dorm room.  It is a decent dorm room, and they (apparently) have wifi.  If you do foursquare, you can check in for the first time and get a discount.  If you're the mayor, the deal is even better.  But it's still a dorm room, yo."
1676,4,This is the best Cajun resturant in Arizona. I've lived in Louisiana before and this is as close as it gets for AZ. I had the crawfish ettouffe and its was awesome and the most authentic I've had since living in Louisiana. My wife had the sampler and she loved it. The atmosphere is great. The live music added to the experience. It was kinda loud though. The waitress was kind of wierd. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some good  cajun food. It is on the pricey side but its worth it.
12859,1,For the price and location  not a bad value. But I wouldn't stay here again. I saw check-in lines go well over an hour during my stay. It looked like the airport TSA line on a bad day. Just wouldn't be worth it to start a weekend with that experience.
39393,4,"Their arepas are AMAZING! It was my first time trying this but it was a perfect fit to my taste buds. Location is couple miles from the strip and the plaza looks old but it is nice inside the restaurant. The arepas also come with two sauces in a bottle. You can use it as a spread for the arepas and it is absolutely delicious! It is spicy, savory, and creamy! It went so well with my food! The cashier, George, was also very patient when I was ordering and knowledgable about their menu. It is not cheap cheap but compared to other restaurants and buffets on the strip, it is cheap and worth it for the quality of the food."
5086,1,"The service here was good but the portions for the price and the quality was not. Yes the food did taste good but nothing really stood out. I guess since I live near the san gabriel area im pretty much used to this type of food at a more reasonable price. Good dishes to get here are the black bean sauce clams, stir fried string beans,  and fried salt and pepper sea bass. Parking is easy and the wait isn't long."
24368,4,Loved it.  Perfect thin and charred crust and great toppings.  Very fast service for a busy place.  Better than the place at Hilldale.
21402,3,"Since Im big into breakfast foods, Im always on the look out for a new place.. and whadda ya know. .I found \""The Place\""  How convieeeeent.. \n\nI read the reviews and when asking a few people on Facebook about it, I heard nothing good good responses, so why not give it a shot.  I heard that you have to be early or it gets insane.  We showed up about 9AM and waited for maybe 5min.  Not too bad. \n\nThe menu looked incredible and as I watched the servers take food to the tables, I could see that the amounts of food give were enormous.  I couldn't wait.  Checking the reviews on Yelp, I ordered a chorizo omelet with avocado, and all the fixens.  I thought I'd love it, but I think I was more overwhelmed with spice than anything. and I love spicy food.. what gives?  \n\nThe second time we all went, we got there at 8AM and sat right away.. this time I was told to order biscuits and gravy..  Damn were they good.  I got an order of those along with a huge pancake.   Here's what I loved about their pancakes.. they tasted home cooked.  Like when your mom takes out the old griddle that still has last weeks charred food on it,  yet still cooks on it, and it has that home yummy taste? Yep.. that's their pancakes.   Downed that with some iced tea and it was one awesome breakfast.  \n\nIve been here three times now in two months... I think Im hooked."
42962,4,Shut up. Go Here. And get the Mac Gnarly Burger or any burger...yum.\n\nBeachy vibe...awesome fries too man i'm hungry. Just do it.
30207,1,"Tasty enchiladas, great salsa and flavorful beans but it ended up being a bit pricey for Mex fast food.  I ordered the 2 enchilada combo plate listed at $5.85, then added a soft drink and the bill ended up costing $9.50.  \n\nLooking at the receipt I see they charged $1.00 extra for having chicken - didn't see that listed on the menu and the cashier didn't tell me about it which was a bit of a surprise."
45186,4,"We have stayed here twice. Once as a groupon and once as a comp. it's such a clean neat hotel we love it. Next time we are bringing the kids to enjoy the pool and the movies. We will stay here again. The buffet on Tuesday mmmmm. Also breakfast is a steal at $5.99. Great place, great value. Especially when you're not a fan of the strip."
11404,1,"Yes it's a pizza joint...but was in the mood for a folded pizza lets say...Calzone..You can have it baked or fried!!  Order a small Calzone..OMG it was more than enough, took half home. Had small salad ($2.99)..just lettuce,olives,tomatoes,peppers..not great, but italian dressing was good.  Calzone was good.....but I guess their forte is Pizza....He had a line ordering .....Service is friendly but hit/miss w/ whoever is working the house. Waiter said the baked calzone was just coming out of the oven..took him 15 min to get it to the table....Would I go back, probably if I lived closer..I'd consider Broadway Pizza a better option (Rancho/Charleston)."
29235,4,I love Luci's!!! Get their Hot Juan Black Bean Burger. It's the best I've ever had. Also try their sweet tots to at least once in place of their tator tots. So good YUM!
30992,2,"This is a review of their lunch menu.\n\nThe Skinny: food is nothing awe inspiring however the quality of the ingredients is very good (3.5) service: was okay... but I expected something better from a place in the Mandarin Oriental (3) value: appears expensive but portion sizes are commensurate with location and service unless you're talking about the sushi. (3.5)\n\nAfter going to the Spa at the Mandarin Oriental with my sister, we opted to head here for lunch. (I wasn't looking forward to having my spa smell obliterated by the smell of cigarette smoke, thank you very much.)\n\nI had seen the menus at Mozen Bistro before so I was anticipated my wallet to be raped royally. What I found surprised me.\n\nThe lunch menu had several items on it below $20 with very healthy portion sizes. Opting for my standard favourite, I opted for the Smoked Turkey Club ($16; comes with fries and salad). The hubs ordered a kobe beef burger with pretty much unlimited toppings ($28; includes fries and salad).  My sister chose the Thai Beef Salad.\n\nWe were started with a lovely basket of various rolls with three dipping sauces. Although the sauces (a tzatztki, a sundried tomato anti-pasti, an olive oil) did not appear to suit the bread that was served (baguette really needs butter), it was definitely nice to have to start the meal. \n\nFor the sandwiches, it came with a rather large portion of fries and salad. The dressing wa a nice light dressing with just the right amount of acidity while the fries were nice and crisp. The generous serving sizes really surprised us given our location (on the Strip) and the cost of the meals.\n\nI really enjoyed my turkey club sandwich. Although I would have preferred real fresh turkey, the amount of quality deli turkey was really good. Add to that a nice assortment of cheese (smoked gouda!), bacon and avocado, it made for a pretty nice big sandwich (I could barely finish half of it... even when I took out 60% of the bread). I do wish that the sandwich was heated to allow the cheese to melt a bit and the meat to be warm but that is personal taste.\n\nNext, the Kobe burger. It's kind of a unlimited toppings deal so my hubby ordered it with bibb lettuce, cheddar, grilled onions, and wild mushrooms. For a fancy place, the burger was a definite two-handed affair.  He could barely get his mouth around that bad boy! It was also prepared perfectly medium rare. I asked him how it tasted. He replied, \""Not the best burger I've ever had, but given the quality and quantity - very decent on both accounts\"".\n\nMy sister's Thai beef salad was also quite tasty. Loaded with a ton of ribeye (\""there's half a cow in here!\""), it was decently priced given the amount of protein. She also indulged in 3 warm rolls to fill in the carb gap.\n\nBy now we felt very close to Mr.Creosote (from The Meaning of LIfe), so of course the waiter comes by with three still warm lemon madelines. Not being able to pass these up, we gobbled those beautiful buttery beauties up. I literally did not need to eat until the next morning.\n\nOverall, the service was only okay in my books. Given the caliber of this establishment, there were numerous times we had to signal our slightly vacant waiter to refill water, to get a box for our leftovers, to get our cheque.  Despite this, the staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our meal which is a plus.\n\nGiven the quality of the food and portion sizes, this place gets a 3.5 stars. I am definitely interested to try this place again although I will pass on the sushi (I checked an adjacent table's maki which appeared to have way too much rice to filling ratio... that's no good in my  books!)."
37328,3,Very good food. Authentic. Spicy as indicated by name. We went there for dinner twice during our short visit to Vegas and we were happy both times.
13482,4,"I would really like to give Shibuya four and a half stars because its over priced--but that's Vegas.  Otherwise the food was excellent.  Every bite of my seared Akami tuna was blissful.  The tuna was in a nice sweet sauce that ended with a spicy finish.  We also tried the Sushi (Rainbow roll) which was also fresh and exceeded my expectations.  We didn't try any Sake, though their menu claims to have the largest selection of sake on this side of the Pacific, but my martini, made with Japanese alcohol, was excellent.\n\nI also enjoyed the atmosphere.  The restaurant is divided into intimate sections by floor-to-ceiling wooden dividers reminiscent of cascading water which leaves the space feeling open yet private.  As is typical of all over-priced Vegas restaurants, there is a hip, smooth vibe and plenty of chicly dressed patrons.  Service was above average."
40385,0,"I can't believe this place. I have starving children at home, they take my entire order and at the end, they tell me that the 3.4 miles to my house is on the wrong side of the street and can't deliver to them. I offered $10 tip and then a $20 dollar tip and they still refused! Said he manager wouldn't allow it. Well, there's major storm of the century outside right now we're left without very many options. Thanks Jimmy. You suck."
38247,1,Service was bad. Waitress forgot our drinks. Food was bad. The beer cheese looked and tasted like vomit. Then we couldn't leave because the waitress wouldn't return. Even the beer was bad! I am the least picky eater EVER and I hated the 'Ole Caw'. Waste of calories.
834,4,"OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY. \n\nDarlene is the owner and #1 World Champion Queen of the Alteration Universe. I really cannot say enough good things about her. Her friendliness, dedication, and skill are unmatched. \n\nI started taking my dress pants here to be taken up almost 8 years ago when I was still in school at Ye Olde UW. At the time, it seemed a pretty far way to go for an alteration place (ALL the way on the east side LOL). But after the first experience, I would never go anywhere else. \n\nI took my wedding dress here for alterations too. As expected, a fantastic job. Now that I live 3 states away, I still bring stuff with me when I visit and have her ship it back to me! Yes, this place is THAT good. Friendly, prompt service, and very reasonable prices. \n\nDarlene and her staff (one other person who I've never met but must be equally as amazing), are just the BOMB plain and simple. Never had a problem with anything done here. Back in the day Alterred States was just a teensy little store in a strip mall on Northport. Now, she's taken over the big middle part! Just goes to show I'm not the only (extremely fanatic) satisfied customer! \n\nBest spot ever. Take your stuff here. You won't be disappointed."
12070,3,Great little find on Atwood Street. The shrimp & corn fritters were super fish. The Pad Thai was very tasty and the Malaysian meat quartet covered all the bases.
35774,4,"After spending 3 days in Vegas last month, we were pretty much over food.  Everything started to taste the same.  While on our way to a comedy show, we stopped in at KGB for a quick dinner and found what is now our favorite restaurant there.  Everything was tasty, but the standouts were the Ceasar salad and the fried pickles.  If you haven't had a fried pickle, do yourself an honest favor.  Do yourself another favor and let them cool first- hot spears are like lava, and you will suffer the consequences."
5176,0,"This was one of my favorite Savers locations.  Cute clothes at reasonable prices.  However, as of late, talk about price gauging.  Used donated jeans for $50.  Give me a break!  Expressed to manager that their pricing has become unreasonable for used donated clothing.  Would not hear any of my comments.  I was told that jeans were \""NEW\"" even though it did not have any tags and if I looked up the item online I would find the jeans at the same price. \n\n I thought that Savers was categorized as a \""Thrift Store\"".  Since when do you compete with online retailers?   How do you help your community with those on a limited budget.  You are taking advantage!"
1958,4,"The exhaustive search is finally over!  I finally found a hair stylist who knows what he's doing, is friendly, takes his time, gives great conversation and a neck massage and is easy on the eyes.  I didn't even have to go home and fix anything after Bobby cut my hair, which is usually not the case.  I was so impressed that I set my next appointment before I left.\n\n*** 5th HAIRCUT UPDATE ***\nAfter my 5th haircut with Bobby, I can not complain about a thing.  I don't even have to tell him how to cut my hair anymore.  He remembers what I want and how I like it.  He's so personable that he makes getting my hair cut an event rather than an appointment.    \n\n******** November 08' UPDATE**********\nOK fellow Yelpers, you're really starting to ruffle my feathers!  I shouldn't have said such nice things about Bobby because now YOU people are making it difficult for ME to get an appointment (or as I like to call it, a date) with Bobby.  From now on, I'm going to start giving aliases for people who are in my reviews.  \n\nSo forget all the things I said about that Bobby guy, that was an alias that I made up.  Really, the person who cut my hair was Frank or Fred or Fritz, I highly recommend him.  He's great if you can get past the multiple personality disorder."
27386,2,"There are so many good reviews here that I almost feel I was in a different eatery. Perhaps I need to give it another chance, yet, I found it average in every respect so I doubt I will return."
15956,2,Over priced food. Food was OK. \n\nNothing really speical about it. Maybe just the decorations.
29997,2,"Cute place, but food was... meh. Portions are a bit smaller and the food seems a little catered to white people, as in not as spicy and seasoned. The beef salad was awesome but I'd shy away from the pad Thai and friend rice."
79,4,"Those who know, know this is the place to buy your cases of beer. The prices are low and the tax is included in the price tag, but the best reason to shop here is Sam. He is a character, knows a lot about beer and is a really nice guy.  First time we stopped by, he invited us into his shop and stock area and we talked for quite a while before departing with some real good beer.  Sam Caruso has a story for almost every occasion and  the beer to match each occasion. A real Pittsburgh place."
29974,2,"A little underwhelmed by the much-hyped Chicken Tikka Masala. Ordered take out, added on the garlic naan and galub jamon. Specified a spice level of 5/10 for my 'tikka and order was out in 10 minutes flat, with a large side of basmati rice.\n\nChicken tikka masala was a good size for the $13 price tag, which included the rice. Garlic naan was worth the upcharge: delicious, soft, and flavorful, with a garlic scent that wafted through my car as I drove home. \n\nMy disappointment came when I finally tried my entree. For a spice level of 5, I tasted absolutely no spice. And the sauce had a sweetness to it that I am not familiar with. It wasn't necessarily bad, but the dish didn't have the kick to it I was craving. \nChicken in dish was in large chunks, sauce was a smidge on the thin side.\n\nBased on other reviews, I'm going to have to come back for the lunch buffet and reevaluate."
34210,4,"Yummy! I bought a groupon and went in immediately.  Although their selection was limited, I was lucky enough to get in there in time to get a decent selection.  I didn't know you could special order with a groupon, but I was pleased with what I got. Red velvet, cookies and cream, peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla. My kids LOVED them... And they were so big they couldn't even finish one. The icing is very sweet and you probably won't be able to eat it all. The cake is super moist and Full of flavor. The cupcakes are huge and a great value for the price. The groupon deal is a steal! The staff was attentive and very friendly. The gentleman there was very nice and helpful. I will definitely be back."
6013,1,"I was sooooo disappointed!!  I love this building and the ambiance - it's a Pittsburgh landmark to be sure, but the buffet was mediocre at best.\n\nI don't even know where to start.  \n\nOur waitress was friendly and prompt to come to the table but didn't provide any explanation as to how things were laid out and where things could be found.  This isn't something I normally need for a buffet but things aren't necessarily clear as to where they are - for instance the pancakes are at the omelet bar and the waffles are at the 'banana foster' table.  Anyway.....\n\nI couldn't find the pancakes and I had read in another review that they did indeed have pancakes.  So after asking a passing server I was directed to the omelet bar and was really surprised when the omelet chef handed me four lukewarm pancakes for me to put on my plate.  They weren't made to order as I understood they would be.  On top of that they ended up being chewey and didn't have much flavor. \n\nThe main buffet was another disappointing experience - the chicken was dry, the roast beef was fatty and overall the main food line was average.\n\nUnfortunately, if you're going to have a banana foster area, which can be a really nice touch, it's important to have  a server who knows what they're doing.  As it turned out, there was a young kid who couldn't tell you banana's foster from a banana split.  There were a couple of people in front of me that asked what a 'banana foster' was and his response was that it was anything you wanted it to be.  That answer confused the folks asking, so they passed. As did I.\n\nMaybe it was just a bad day for them as I know other folks have good things to say.  If you want a beautiful place to take out-of-town visitors, this is certainly it.  But if you want to have a really nice buffet experience, sadly this wouldn't be my first choice."
7520,0,"Dear Shitty Floor Manager at Fry's,\n\nI know that your store's prices are cheaper than almost any place locally. There's a reason I'm buying my MacBook there. However, this does not give you carte blanche to act like a total dick when I don't buy your warranty, nor does it mean you should make me wait 15 minutes just for you to go grab a laptop (one which you yourself admitted you were overstocked on).\n\nWhen someone approaches you in the middle of our conversation to tell you that the keyboard you directed them toward was located in a completely different section of the store than where you sent them, this means you should apologize. It does not mean you should roll your eyes at them.\n\nAnd when I say thanks and begin to walk away, you probably should keep in mind that I can hear you when you tell me \""good luck\"" in reference to my not buying your stupid warranty. The reason I don't want your warranty is because it means I would have to come back and talk to you. I've never broken a laptop in my life, and I'm not going to break this one either. So do your job and shut your mouth.\n\nLove,\n-Kevin\n\nPS: Young polite girl at register, you're A-OK."
21472,2,"The food is decent but this place is really, really loud.  I do not like going here on date night because I cannot hear my wife.\n\nThe food is salty or sugary, but still tastes good; it's nothing special though.\n\nWe go here maybe four times a year; not a bad place before catching a flick at the red rock regal cinema."
10804,0,"Horrific experience!! I was probed and prodded without even a smile!  Can you at least offer to buy me a drink? Never mind, I wouldn't even take a drink from these heartless people that work here. They treat you like cattle meat. Stamp! Poke! Next!"
26983,3,"I stumbled upon The Wine Loft one Monday evening and I'm so glad I did! I've been looking for a Wine bar type place that stays open relatively late (why do so many close so early?!). Well, this place definitely delivers. I've only ever been during the week and it hasn't been that crowded (which is perfect). I post up on one of the leather couches and enjoy a glass (or three) of wine. They also have specials each night of the week so check them out! They have nights with half off apps, half off wine, etc. It's a great place to go and hang out, chat and catch up with friends. The staff seem knowledgeable and always willing to help! \n\n I've had some of the appetizers, the Mezza plate (olives/hummus/feta dip) and the Caprese salad. Both were good but I though that the Mezza plate could have come with more olives. I also had the chocolate mousse dessert and wow - it was so rich and chocolaty! Yum!! \n\nAlso - if you have any type of groupon/restaurant.com deal, know that these cannot be combined with their daily specials."
35908,2,"My boyfriend and I were looking forward to our first dinner in Montreal, hoping for a unique dining experience. Unfortunately the restaurant we originally wanted to go to this night had closed down. We were starving and on a time crunch, so Steak Frites it was. Had no idea this place was a chain. The menu was not really creative and the frites weren't fresh - and lacked salt. There was nothing BAD about our steak, but nothing on the plate wowed us. Tiny portions, but maybe that is just a french thing. Special dipping sauces were gross. Outside seating was nice though, and the hostess was very sweet."
27334,2,After hearing so much about Dinette I finally tried it with my granddaughter..  My bill was close to 50$ and all we had were two pizzas and a single glass of wine.. The pizza was mediocre with burned toppings and the crust was way over done.. Also the toppings were sparse and ungenerous... I am used to gourmet pizza and seek it out; yet this does not qualify..
6625,1,"I went there for the lunch deals only, but I can't say I'm impressed with the food. Service there is really nice and their lunch portions are filling, but their pasta is very overcooked. It's also a bit dark inside the place, but it's nice and quiet for the most part."
42611,4,"Aghhhh I love ICE CREAM\n\nSo this place is right across the street from my apartment. I came here in high hopes not to be disappointed and sure enough I wasn't. My dads family is from Michoacan so I know what the ice cream should taste like. This place has exactly that. The ice cream is creamy and full of flavors. They make their own ice cream which is a plus.\n\nThis place also has fresh made flavored waters. For example horchata, mango, limon, melon, and etc. Plus they have Botanas aka Mexican snacks. \n\nThey will put what ever you want on you ice cream I always get the nuez ice cream with coconut and chocolate.\nThey also have outside seating where you can just watch the the cars and people outside."
20647,3,Their service has improved tremendously and the staff is very upbeat and proactive.
16078,1,"Don't waste your money! My wife and I have always eaten there when visiting Vegas, but the price has gone way up and the food quality and selection way down. We arrived at 8pm on a Saturday night ... no line at all to get in, and the seating was only half full. That told us something right away. We went to Caesars Bacchanal buffet two nights later and it was absolutely unbelievable. I could spend a whole week just trying all the selections available, and the food quality is top notch. The price was only $2.00/ea more than the Village Seafood Buffet, and there is no comparison. Go to Bacchanal, wait 20 - 30 minutes in line, then enter heaven. We won't be back to the Village Seafood Buffet --- ever!"
12147,4,"This is the place you go to when you want to feel super cool.\n\nThere is so much history to this building (and apparently is haunted...boo!) which makes you feel like you are experiencing a true taste of Madison culture.  It started out as a Vaudeville theater, which you just can't find anywhere else!  \n\nThe old fashioned box seating juxtaposes the trendy hipster regulars in a way that feels so good.\n\nCheck their site frequently for unique film showings, awesome bands and tons of costume theme nights.  \n\nGreat bar and pretty good drinkin' deals.  Themed, of course."
468,1,"I'm writing this review as I sit in the Hilton Garden Inn at Charlotte.\n\nThe rooms are adequate, with most coming with a flat screen television or two, comfortable beds, and ample showers or hot tub jacuzzis. There is also a full service restaurant and bar in the Lounge area of the Hotel.\n\nI will also give them a nod for their complimentary shuttle which will travel you anywhere in a three mile radius of the hotel. The dude driving the shuttle was very polite and curtious ... I'm guessing because he didn't have to stay or work in the Hotel itself.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.\n\nThe gym facilities are atrocious. 2 Treadmills, a recumbant bike, and an Elliptical machine with maybe 4 medicine balls littered around a room that measures 6 ft x 20ft, if that. A grotesque pool with a grimey bottom that on more than one occasion I considered drowning myself in to free myself from my mortal shackles and break free from this prison of a hotel.\n\nConcierge wasn't helpful at all -- when I arrived at the front desk and asked if I could score a bottle of water to use the gym, because I didn't feel like paying the $4.00 fee for drinking the Fiji water they had in my room, the guy at the front desk stuck up his nose and snootily informed me \""You can purchase water from the gift shop.\"" Sorry buddy, at over $150 bucks per night, you can *give* me a water for the cost of... free. Also, what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift?\n\nThe in House internet is the slowest you will find. I'm a computer / IT guy myself and it is flagrantly apparent that this place throttles their bandwidth usage. Online Games of any type slow to a crawl, and streaming video sites such as Hulu or YouTube take forever and a day to load. This is the year 2010 -- we should have hover cars by now, but apparently its too much to ask for a sad excuse for a Hilton to manage their Internet Connection enough to let me watch the Keyboard Cat before dying of boredom.\n\nThe location is also horrible. Right next to the Nascar Hall of Fame ... and thats about it. Everywhere you'd want to go is located 1/2 mile or so into the city, so you have to take the shuttle to get anywhere. Without the shuttle, this place would be unstayable.\n\nAlright / Mediocre Rooms + Satisfactory Shuttle Service + Snooty Concierge + Horrible Gym Facilities + Atrocious Location = Don't waste your time. I saw a park bench a few blocks away that I will be living under during my next stay in Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and visit the aLoft at the Epicenter -- it beats this place in every measurable way."
8821,1,Meh.  Had the filet and it was a little bland.  My salmon was very fishy.
32700,4,"Well, my husband and I LOVE culinary dropout ...they don't have one in Southern California yet that I know of but we usually make it a point to come here every time were in AZ. We visit family here and my husband works here so when we get the chance to come we always do. We have never been disappointed . I love the cheese platter- pretzel anything there- drinks are always spot on-. We spend usually 2-3 hours each time were there just drinking and eating till we can't move. We usually go mid day and a lot during the week which is why we've never hit a real busy time. Tonight well be going so it'll be our first nighttime visit. Can't wait - foods great and drinks are creative"
33701,4,"The $5 lunch deal is a lot of awesome food - why would anyone go to the Subway next door?  Because of the popularity of the lunch deal, they're usually super busy during lunch hours.  No matter how long you have to wait though, you'll always get friendly service.\n\nAll of their breads are freshly made and you can't go wrong with any of them.  I've tried the wheat, ciabatta and sour dough and they're all really good.\n\nMy co-workers and I go there about once a week and we all love the Hell's Kitchen, Chicken Salad, Tuna Salad and of course the Turkey sandwiches, so I'd definitely recommend any of those."
3226,4,"My place for a steak anywhere and always.\n\nTheir service is consistently good and their food quality is top notch.  \n\nIn 20 plus years of dining with them I've only had 2 mediocre steaks and both times the staff exceeded our expectations in correcting the matter.  Wine selection used to be better with more Spanish and Argentine options.  Get rid of the Malbec che.  Es puro pedo.  Dame Rioja, Bonarda o Cabernet."
33956,4,I love how friendly everyone is and they have the best beds that give the best color in town
2176,3,"Just got back from breakfast at the 40th Street Cafe.  For a Tuesday morning, it was BUSY.  Only a couple tables open.  My waitress Sherrie was a total delight; I never saw a smile leave her face.\n\nI ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant (75 cents extra, totally worth it), sub bacon instead of ham, and sub scrambled eggs instead of the over hard egg just like I saw in a picture here on yelp.  It was great!  Loads of bacon, the eggs were great (not dry like other breakfast places like to serve you).  The hashbrowns were good - although not seasoned at all, like another reviewer noted, so I had to salt them myself... but that seems to be a norm for breakfast places like these, since a lot of their clientele is of the older generation who can't handle salt.\n\nLots of regulars here, lots of people just sitting drinking coffee and reading the paper.  Although one woman was totally rude and annoying - my waitress was taking the order of a woman sitting at the table next to me, and a woman at the table across the aisle threw her wadded-up straw wrapper at the waitress while she was taking the order - it almost landed in the full pot of coffee on the table - then apologized to the customer getting her order taken, saying she was trying to hit the waitress, and let out the most ungodly hyena-like guffaw I've ever heard.  I get that you know the waitress and you're trying to be funny, but jesus christ.  Have some respect and try to contain yourself.  She was at least 60 years old btw.\n\nANYWAY, overall it was a great experience and I had a good time just sitting there eating watching the price is right on their 20-year-old television.  I'll be heading back there for sure."
22910,1,"All those fancy displays can't make up for their lack of customer service. \n\nI stopped in recently to take a look at their North Face section as well as their hiking boots. Honestly, I feel like stores like Sports Authority are going to be going the way of the dodo soon because their prices are MUCH higher than online retailers. Rarely a sale item will be on par with Amazon.com or other online stores. But, I figured I would stop in anyway to see what they had available in windbreakers. \n\nThe result? Not much. And everything was priced at MSRP retail to boot. Of course, I mean look at the size of the store. Look at all those employees talking to each other instead of their customers, and look at the cashier playing with her iPhone instead of looking for people to assist. That's quite the payroll to make every week. \n\nAnyway, I was in there for 20 minutes, got asked if I needed help zero times, got no glance or assistance in the shoe section, and got no \""have a nice day\"" from the cashier texting and looking down as me and another customer walked out. Yeah, Sports Authority has seen better days for sure. Big box will be dead soon and the folks \""working\"" there will have plenty of time to text from home. \n\nGood riddance!"
39410,4,"This is a great lunch spot. I am so happy I found this place as I'm always on the lookout for fresh new lunch places! \n\nWe arrived around 1 and the place was packed.  We had to wait for about 10 mins for a table to open up but I'm so glad that we did. The restaurant was very clean despite the crowd. \n\nI ordered the Greek Rice Bowl which had two chicken skewers on a bed of rice covered in lettuce, marinated chickpeas, feta cheese, and kalamata olives.  You can add onion and tomato if that's your thing.  The bowl is deliciously dressed but there is also a side tzatziki sauce which is so good I felt like I could drink it.  At the risk of embarrassing my company, I refrained...in case you were wondering.\n\nThe only note I would offer is that the place can be a little pricey (almost $30 for two if us).  There are some dishes on the menu (featuring lamb) that are pushing $18 which seemed high for the super casual atmosphere. \n\nThe staff was very accommodating and super friendly. I will definitely be returning!"
13116,2,"we stayed here for 4 days in august last year and it was an OK stay.  probably the last time i will stay here unless there's some supersale on the hotel.\nthe hotel is a bit older but since our friends were getting married at Mandalay Bay, and since we couldnt afford staying there, we chose the closed hotel so the 23 of us didnt have to go too far to be there in time for the wedding.\nthere were construction going on all wknd.  so annoying as we were ok w/ it on Thursday but it seems be pounding w/ those machine all wknd.\n\nthe pool area was small and was not \""pretty\"" as the other hotels.\nclub LAX is there and we all got in for free as we were staying there - one of the best part of the stay as there were lots of us and went in without lines etc. \nlike the ability to go to Excalibur and Mandalay bay on the tram without walking too much but the wait is about 15minutes in the hot sun :(\nour room was not that big...good enough for 2ppl.  if more, it will be tight.\ntheir food court needs more variety.\n\noverall, you really dont get that much but then again, you dont pay that much for the room."
19813,1,"Check-in was extra fabulous! The person working the desk was very friendly. Sadly, it kinda went down hill from there. \n\nIt looks like they've done a fairly recent remodel on this Courtyard, but they skimped a bit on the rooms during the remodel. The bathroom in my room had old outdated floor tiles and crappy plastic on the surround around the tub/shower.They have horrible shower curtains that try very hard to cling to you in the shower which is not a pleasant experience knowing that the curtains have tried to cling to countless strangers in the past. Yuck! The grout between the floor tiles had a fair amount of black mold in it and there was clearly lots of the stuff growing in the pipes in the sink. The stench coming from the sink was godawful and actually got worse when the water was turned on. \n\nThe restaurants in Courtyards are just blehh. I should have just gone out to get carry out on my first night. I missed a very large chunk of the World Series game waiting for my overly microwaved food. They had only one person working in the restaurant and she was clearly overwhelmed.\n\nUpon checkout, I attempted to get the person working the front desk to take me seriously when I told her that they really shouldn't put anyone in that room until they tackle the mold problem, but it was clear from her tone of voice and the look on her face that she didn't particularly care and she thought I was a complaining pain in the ass who she wished would just shut up and leave her alone. I get it...you probably get a lot of complaints, but exposing people who might be sensitive (think severe allergies or asthma) because you can't be bothered to write it down and follow up...that really sucks.\n\nAnd speaking of being a complaining pain in the ass, this hotel has the horrible Marriott pillows that are unreasonably underfilled rendering them uncomfortable and fairly useless.\n\nSo that's it. The Summerlin Courtyard will not be at the top of my wish list for places to stay when traveling to Las Vegas. In fact, it was bad enough that I will be notifying my company's travel department so that they can consider removing it from our preferred list."
49361,2,"I haven't been to Vegas in many years and was told that this place was really fun with amazing DJ's.  So we decided to try it out... \n\nI'm giving it 3 stars solely for their staff's customer service or lack there of! DJ was off the hook- View was spectacular- And great crowd for a Thursday night. \n\nFirst, cover was $30 for guys, $20 for the ladies... Once inside, We were charged the following (not sure if this is consistent for other nights) rail drinks were $15, premium $20+, shots of Fireball were $12, beer $10. \n\nSecond, bartenders (only the entitled females are being addressed), one would think that if a group guys were to come up to you at a bar and it is NOT busy, you would at least smile or say thank you when they leave more than $1 per drink tip, which is standard. Nope these ladies who works for tips were very rude, disinterested in helping or making money. On the other hand, the fellows behind the bars, were FANTASTIC, so go to them!\n\nThird, if you plan to go here with a group, get a table and don't mess with the waiting to get in or standing around for a drink to just be ignored or shoved. In the end you will end up paying the price for a table anyhow. \n\nI would go back because the music and atmosphere made it memorable and positive... But next time, we are getting a table!!!"
28963,0,"This was by far the worst service I've had in awhile, the place was empty and our server never came to us. I think if they changed it to a serve yourself buffet it would be a much better place to have dinner"
6172,1,"I've adopted from local city humane societies before and it was Fantastic! This was unfortunately NOT THE CASE here.\n \nIf you are going to work with this organization on adopting a new family member. Please make sure you have enough patience to handle their process.\n \nThey really need to tweak their adoption process. It takes days for them to approve you for adoption, which means it's better to get approved before you fall in love with any of their visiting members.\n \nUnfortunately we had fallen in love already, so we had another feeling of loss. Which is hard, but there were other dogs that caught our eye, but even that was a mess. We waited for the group of dogs to get fed and 30 minutes later the dog we had waited for was visiting with another family that had just walked in. We were asked to wait again for the dog to have a break from visiting and when the dog came out again we fell in love.\n \nWe went to the front to complete the adoption and what we were told only 35 minutes prior had all of sudden changed. Originally we were told that we could come in the next day with our dog for a meet/greet and complete the adoption then. Instead, we were told that they will file our adoption request with our approved adoption application and \""let us know\"".\n \nI was confused, why everything was coming to a halt again, but I never found out the answer, nor did I ever get a return phone call from them.\n \nMy family and I moved on and had a FANTASTIC adoption experience with a organization that I feel has more heart and compassion and is definitely always going to be a part of my life from now on. Please look at the NORTH MECKLENBURG ANIMAL RESCUE and help these people give a great home to animals."
903,3,Stopped here on our way back form Florida... not much to choose from out here...\n\nI tried the shrimp & grits.. AWESOME!!!!  Never thought  this would be a good combo but it works here!! \nAnd try the crustless coconut cream pie... MMMM!!!\ngood attentive service.
8520,0,"Our first visit was a five:\nWe came across this place by accident but we were pleasantly surprised by how good it was. My husband had the silver city sub which is an Italian style sub, which he said was one of the best he has ever had. I had there home stake which was really good as well.\n\nOur last visit would be !/2 a star:\nService was very slow and the sandwiches were not very good at all we should have gone to Jimmy Johns down the street. We wont be going back!"
42155,3,"As someone who keeps an eye out for new burgers, I am always very pleased to hear when something new shows up.  The bigger joy is when a place opens up in an area where you can't really find something you want.  In that case, Lasalle recently welcomed a new restaurant opened by someone who is quite familiar to the restaurant scene.  Saul Ettinger's latest offering is his fourth stab at bringing us the very best in smoked meat and burgers.  If we have learned from the other places he had a hand in, this one should be quite something.\n\nEttingers caught my eye a few months back, as I was doing my normal burger research.  The fact that it was opening in Lasalle was a very big plus for me, as there aren't any previous Burger Search locations that could be found in one of my favorite parts of town.  When I heard the claims of having quite the burger on radio ads that aired on TSN 990, I just had to go.\n\nI'm so glad that Ettingers set up shop in Lasalle or anywhere for that matter.  What you'll get is solid smoked meat and a pretty decent burger.  The combination of service, decor, and quite good dessert made this visit one that I won't forget for a while.  I really do hope that Ettingers is around for a very long time and that it does well, because I really want to go back."
17434,2,"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said! It is a Vegas buffet. It's got a ton of choices, none stellar, none crappy.\n\nIt's perfect if you need to fill up fast while at the Excalibur and not waste your time deciding where to go eat."
3733,2,"I used to be a student and this place was awesome for studying and keeping caffeinated.  Now though, when I go there to relax, I feel like I'm sitting in a study hall with a coffee bar in it.  More power to them for catering to students, we all know these places are hard to find.  But, if you're a few years graduated, you may want to try somewhere else...or just get their coffee to go (it's very tasty)."
18964,1,"This is the RUDEST Trader Joes I've been to. It was like walking into Walmart, only worse if that's possible. Only one person/employee in the whole store had anything resembling MANNERS! !\nYIKES!!!"
41618,0,"We waited in line for about an hour (we got there around 11pm) and we were on the guest list, so there was a separate line. Girls got in for free while the guys had to pay $30. Walking in, it immediately reminded me of the clubs in LA! I would rather go to TAO, Marquee or XS and pay instead of this place. Why go 250 miles to club at a place like in LA?"
24418,1,"I'm a vegetarian, so if you are a meat and potatoes type of person ignore my star reviews.  \n\nI ended up getting the blueberry pancakes, which were good considering the place I was at.  They were not perfectly round and have fresh blueberries, so like what I would make at home.  Not the perfect cookie cutter ones like at IHOP.  \nI did love I got my own jar of blueberry compote, it was warmed up too.  (I kept the bottle, I love little things like that.)\n\nEvery dish on the menu was meat, except for the veggie platter (I believe that is what it is called).  The breakfast menu was the one that had the least meat dishes. \n\nThe server was very friendly, I asked for decaf iced tea so he brought me hot decaf tea and a cup of ice.  Like that he did that.  The server was very nice.\n\nWe got there around 7 pm, it was very busy with in an hour many of the snowbirds had left.  \n\nThe food took awhile to get to us after ordered it.  The place is also very packed together.    \n\nThey give us biscuits and a cornbread which are very dry and flavorless to me.  (we always make our own bread and cornbread so restaurant varieties just don't match up).  \n\nIf anyone is eating post weight loss surgery and don't eat meat, it's not a very good place.   \n\nThe store had a lot of cute kitschy items.  I didn't check the whole store, but they had a lot of candy in big boxes and some toys.  They did have a lot of kitchen and rooster items for the kitchen.  I thought those were adorable."
49501,4,"Amazing menu and overall solid execution. Substantial drink list which shows lots of thought was put into it. Not sure if there are any concepts like this that combine the Mexican and Asian cuisine so well.  Attention to detail is apparent. Some of the food may have taken too long to come out, so that might need some oversight. The tortillas for the guac were of inconsistent crunchiness. But that is easy too. The Korean beef tacos and the pork belly ramen were both easily 5 stars. I'll be back."
44149,1,"Trying to take care of a few final Henderson restaurant reviews before I moved my office completely away from the area, I recently headed over to the Hi Scores Bar-Arcade to grab a burger and check out the scene. I have a friend that is a regular there, and speaks very highly of the staff, the space and their food so I figured it would be good lunch. Can going to a video game-based bar for lunch be a good idea?\n\nLocated just off the 215 on Stephanie in a fairly isolated corner spot, the bar shares its building with another restaurant whose name escapes me at the moment. You step through the Hi Scores' side door into a confusing intersection of two spaces; a dark bar and a tight looking seating area with some arcade games. Since it was noon in the middle of the week, the regular dining area was completely empty so I headed into the bar side. The bar has 4 booths, a couple high tops and maybe 20 bar seats around a crazy TV display. The scene for my lunch was complete with bad music videos, plenty of smoking patrons and lasers on the walls. The 'restaurant' side extends behind this bar area and has plenty of booth seats as well as more video games. I've read many people online trying to compare this place to Insert Coins downtown because of the video game aspect; I will not really address this because I hate that place and they're not really the same thing.\n\nThe menu has all sorts of Hawaiian items, sandwiches and crazy bar food that you'd probably want to eat if you're of the crowd that does plenty of snacking while gaming. Their one burger on the menu, the Pac Burger, is an angus patty topped with swiss and cheddar cheese, red onion, tomato and butter lettuce. The patty had great char flavor, but was still a bit too dry and overcooked considering it dripped and made a bit of a mess at first. The butter lettuce was insane for a second time in recent weeks (Poppy Den), is this a new trend to make something look dramatic? Well it's dumb. The LTO were all good, and the cheese was melted but not too present. The bun was very sweet, very dry and just took over the whole meal. All I could taste was the bun with each bite, more than the patty or anything else, and it ended up really taking away from the burger.\n\nThe fries were of a slightly thick cut, and could have been decent if they weren't so undercooked and the cooking oil had gotten changed as it was definitely old and a bit foul. Plus they were so undercooked I think I actually tasted raw potato at one point. Based on this meal and some of the others I saw coming out from the kitchen, I think the food looks great but doesn't quite deliver. I'll also note that even though it was noon-ish on a weekday, it was fairly busy in the bar area and the only person serving all of us was the one waitress behind the bar. She did her best for the most part, but when she took my empty plate away at the end of my meal she also took my half empty iced tea. I thought maybe she was going to refill it, but when she returned with just my check I knew my drink was gone for good. I don't think I've ever seen that happen before but whatever, I guess it gives me something else to talk about. $7 for this burger isn't too bad, but when you add another $3.50 for raw potatoes and $3 for an iced tea that I wasn't able to finish, and you suddenly have a $14.59 meal that was way too much. As a whole I'd say if you're into video games and mediocre bar food this is probably a great place, but if you're looking for great food and great atmosphere this is probably not your destination."
48172,3,"Desnudo tacos ( tacos naked ) is not your ordinary taco shop, they don't rely solely on grease for flavorful tacos, they actually use some kind of Aztec or Mayan magic to create some of the best tasting tacos I've had this side of the I-15 in Vegas.\nWith my tacos I ordered some sides, the fideo soup which it was really good, alittle bit on the salty side but good nonetheless. The garlic rice was...we'll too garlicky for me, the beans where so good I could just eat a bowl of them by itself. The meat in the tacos was juicy and tender and topped with real Mexican cheese, I added some real good homemade Mexican salsa which they have in many heat levels nicely supplied in a bottles instead of the common little salsa bowls.\n This is also not your basic traditional taco shop either, it is actually a sit down restaurant where they bring you a menu and go through all that blah blah restaurant stuff and although the service is more than awesome the reason I usually go to taco places is for quick fast food style service but if they are going to take the full service route then they should at least serve complimentary chips and salsa. so next time I stop here I'll make sure I have more than enough time to enjoy the nicely decorated room, dia de lo muertos style, and listen to the not so Mexican alternative rock style music. \n No shirt, no shoes no service..... But go desnudo."
35397,4,"Salt 'n' Pepper is an amazing place to visit for a healthy and delicious lunch any day of the week.  The shop has a freidnly, relaxing feel to it and you can either sit in or take you food away to enjoy it. \n\nAs it's located on George IV Bridge it's ideal for grabbing something quick and easy on the go.  They have a huge range of sandwich fillings, all of which are fresh and many are locally sourced.  There's smoked meats, cheeses, fresh salad and an extensive selection of sauce to choose from.\n\nI usually go for a turkey wrap with cheese, salad and mayonnaise which costs about \u00a32.90, tastes amazing and is the perfect size for a filling lunch."
44187,2,"3 1/2 stars. Located in the same strip center as Raku and Monta Ramen I arrived for lunch and was surprised how small but cute the place is. There was only one other patron besides myself. \n\nMy order the pork cutlet curry. My dish arrived promptly and the curry sauce was flavorful but I added medium spicy seasoning for additional spiciness. I thought the pork was on the tough side and was a little difficult to even cut. \n\nI thought Japanese Curry Zen was pretty average and prefer Coco Ichiban due to they have a larger variety and offer combinations.\n\nDon't get me wrong, if I'm craving Japanese Curry in LV I would return to Japanese Curry Zen."
38799,4,"This is my hidden gem find during the last LV trip.\n\nIt was our first night arriving in LV for the CES show. All the airport travel hassles made us really hungry and ready for great food.  Armed with a sheet of to-try resto during this trip, we drove to the middle of almost no-where hoping to find that next hidden gem during this trip. And we hit a jackpot!\n\nL O C A T I O N: on a quiet strip mall, not much light at night; a bit out of the way. not a good business location.\n\nS E R V I C E: Excellent service, polite. Our waiter was a young Japanese guy from Central Japan, he was very patient explainig in details each of the item we asked him and never rushed us to order.\n\nThe place opened about a year ago.  For a place that's at least the same par as Raku, this was place noticeable not as busy as Raku; most likely due to their location. This place has a nicer decor and sits more comfortable than Raku; but Raku has that typical authentic Tokyo's gritty izakaya feel which some people may prefer more. These two places have both their pluses and minuses.\n\nWe'd probably sit next to the bar next time to watch the hustle & bustle inside their open kitchen.  Their bar seating area had a nice ambiance light \n\nThis place has quite reasonable prices and small collection, but interesting selections of Premium Sake, Shochu and Japanese \""whisky\"". This place also carries Genshu - undiluted sake with relatively high (18-20%) alcohol content.\n\nAt the recommendation of our waiter, we opted for the Ozeki Osakaya Chobei (Junmai Daiginjo) instead. 300ml/$38.\n\nIka Geso-Age - one of the best, tastiest fried squid legs. The batter was thin and extremely tasty.  The aroma came out nicely when sprinkled with a dash of lemon.  This dish somehow always ended up on my side of the table. $3.80\n\nGobo chips - fried burdock root.  Not commonly found in many Izakayas. $2.80\n\nHamachi Jalapeno - This sliced yellowtail with Yuzu ponzu was certainly one of the winner of the night! $9.50\n\nIka Uni Ae - $4.50. This is a dish for unilover (\""yoo\"" nee lover? is that a new word?) because the Uni is mashed and mixed with soft slices of Ika, creating an intensified aroma of uni. Probably not for univirgin.\n\nSaki Ika tempura - deep fried dried squid. $3.80. This was OK only for me. It reminds me of those dried squid snacks you find in Taiwan, or other Asian snack shops.\n\nSKEWERS\nsunagimo - chicken gizzard $1.80\nnasu - eggplant $1.50\nShoniku - chicken thigh $1.80\nsasami wasabi - chicken breast  $2.30\nTsukune+Egg - Ground Chicken and Pork $2.50 (+$1 with cage-free egg)\n\nWe ended our meal with the obligatory Mini Udon which we ordered in double-size ($3.80/ea).  The broth was savory, light, yet tasty with the right balance of salt.  \n\nBy this time we're full, but couldn't resist the Dessert. Our waiter recommended the Tofu Mousse (came with 3 scoops of Strawberry sorbet).  We ordered his recommendation and added the Green Tea Waffle ($5.25). His Tofu Mousse recommendation was definitely the winner - light and refreshing.   The green tea waffle is just a bit too dense/heavy after all the meals.\n\nWe left satisfied. Great service, great food; our stomach left happy as well and our feet are ready for the grueling walk at the ultra,mega CES show floor.\n\nWe shall be back!"
35496,2,"If I were drinking, this place would probably rate as a 5 star.  And the food was done pretty well..... except for the fact that... well... it was done... pretty... well.\n\nThe calamari came out looking like either they were re-using oil or they had left it in the oil too long.   You don't fry calamari like fries where if they're a little too golden, it's okay.  Strangely enough, I tried their famous Mac & Cheese squared.... and it was great, except... it was a little over done too.  Strange.\n\nNow I might update my review of them later since their service although good, was a bit inattentive at times, and it was crowded beyond belief.  Probably due to the Luke Bryan concert going on at the Red Rock that night.  Yeah yeah, I know.  I was like... Luke who? (some country singer for those that don't know).  Hey... what can I say, I'm not a huge fan of country.\n\nSo the drop in stars really comes from the food side and a little bit on the service end since the beer selection was great and that actually came out in a timely fashion.\n\nHere's to hoping that next time, the food is done right."
26814,3,"I went there with a frnd today afternoon for a brunch !! Its a lovely place and one of the best that i have been to in Phoenix ! Luved it..Go here when you have plenty of time to realx as you wud want to spend a lot of time wen u see the place.\n\nFew things about this place - \n1. Its a one man show - Christopher runs this place and handles 'everything' by himself.He is very cordial and welcoming \n2. Its BYOB.I noticed Chris helping guests with their bottles i.e opening it for the,serving it as well..I didnt expect that so i appreciate him for that\n3. You will have only 2 options--Sweet ( Baked Lemon ) or Savory ( Egg Stratta that has mushroom,goat cheese,aspargus tomato )..Each plate $20 flat.Also includes a drink of your choice..I had a really nice 'Aqua Fresca'..Its like a fruit punch.He also had green tea , coffee, hibiscus tea.Bdw these 2 options are different every day :-)\n4. Cash only\n\nI luved the decor of the place..very neat & clean  , limited seating indoor ( around 5 two seater tables and 1 four seater ) .

11007,3,"We wanted to go to the pasta shop, but when we got there we found it closed -maybe for good. Based on reviews from other Yelpers we decided to try this. Much different ambiance than the pasta shop bur there was a nice waiter who looked like a cross between John waters and Johnny Depp. They had several specials as well as an extensive menus and the waiter said they could make things like fettucine Alfredo. My husband opted for that and I had lobster ravioli. The meals came with salad or soup although you had to pay extra to upgrade to Caesar salad. The salads were great and quite big. The meals were also delicious although the salad plus the entree was too much food. Our total bill was $60 which seemed like a fair price.  If your are looking for some place to eat off the strip and the pasta shop is still closed try Sergios."
30332,0,"i will never go back to this place. i spent 27 dollars washing and no wifi. when i asked if they could turn it on, the girl looked at me like i was crazy. there is a big sign on the front window that states \""free wifi\"" now as far as the machines go, they washed ok, nothing amazing.  oh, and the parking sucks. never again."
33606,3,"I'm pleased with my experience here. They altered my wedding gown which was an extremely delicate chiffon beaded gown by Tadashi Shoji. Its pricey, but the craftsmanship is excellent  and that might be worth the peace of mind. Its run by a husband and wife and they could not be nicer people. \nMy only complaint is that they are soooo far from where I live!"
39566,2,"This is a fun place in a great location in the Cultural District.  The food is very good, and the decor is charming.  The service is fairly quick, and the wait staff is very polite and helpful.  I was surprised at the devils on horseback, which turned out to be a very delicious appetizer...and something I was not expecting at a place called \""Meat and Potatoes.\""  I have heard people rave about the good food here, and it turns out to be very good and there are some fun choices, however it's certainly not the best Pittsburgh has to offer."
22697,3,I was in town visiting a friend and he said this was a good local bar where we could have a couple beer and play a game of poker. I wish there were something like that in OC. Apparently they have a HUGE soccer following..we were there in January. A good time!
39578,2,"I think this place takes itself overly serious...when your restroom is in the hallway of a neighboring theater it's time to take yourself a little less serious and deal with what you are. \n\nAs a appetizer we had the Kobe Corn Dog (which was very mediocre {didn't have the proper crisp, flavor was off}) and the Poutine (gravy was good wish there was more cheese curd).\n\nI was going to order the Bone Marrow but the couple next to us said \""you have to try the Mac-N-Cheese it's amazing\"" so we did....it was really good. There is Chorizo and Pulled Pork in it so it is very hardy....(we were both going to order entrees but after this we shared one).\n\nWe finished with the Hudson Valley Duck Breast. The pastrami duck was cooked a medium rear and was delicious with the chimichurri.  The pierogies it came with were good but nothing special.\n\nOur server was fine....with us! He was seemingly short with the couple next to us who (the female was a vegetarian) seemingly asked questions about every dish. You got the vibe that maybe he's been spoken to about this by his managers....i.e. quipping back.\n\nHighlight of the night might have been the two Spanish guys (in \""wife-beaters\"") who sat themselves at a table to \""just get some drinks.\"" After two Corona's they left but clearly the restaurant did not have the proper procedures in place to deal with this....\n\n(It shows I have 4 check in's here.....I've only been here once. Verizon network was having issues that night into the morning.)"
25581,1,"Well... I would maybe have been inclined to give Chez Claudette a higher rating if it hadn't been for the following....\n\nordered a poutine classique to go, and then because it was pouring rain decided to eat it inside by the front door.  Even though the place wasn't busy, our french quebec waitress told us that \""next time we order it to go, we have to eat it outside\"".\n\nthe sauce also kind of tasted like thick canned poutine sauce.  \n\nit was still a delicious poutine and we ate the whole thing.\n\nOur small poutine was around $7.  the same price as any other poutine spot."
2314,3,"Totally can not talk crap about this place. There was no line today at all, food is very tasty and fresh, service is nice.

40086,0,Don't use az best tires in mesa you will regret it !!!! I had purchased two used tires from them  in may 2013 and brought my vehicle back to them with the wheel shaking and they  replaced one of the tires which had a bubble on it but not the other one . Well 11 days later the other tire deshreaded on the 60frwy and ripped off my front fender and bumper and tore apart the bottom of the drivers side door . When i made them aware of it and went  to  them to pay for repairs due to what their product (tires ) did to my vehicle they refused . They are not honorable business people and will not take of you like a honorable business does  . They are not worth doing business with !!!!!!
16223,1,"Hash house a no go!!!      Found 3 out of 3 dishes lacking in flavor.    Huge portions.  Chicken hash was dry, pork Benedict was more country fried slab of over cooked meat.  Bbblt was full of bacon but not flavor."
30787,4,"We needed to have our old reverse osmosis system replaced but were having trouble finding a good price. The company we'd used to service our existing system for 10 years had become very pushy with sales pitches and gave us an outrageous quote on a new system. After calling several places, a family member recommended AHW. I'm so thankful! I was able to talk to a knowledgeable person right away and get an immediate quote. Their quote was the best I received. They then offered same day service and had someone out that afternoon. The installer, Jose, was very professional, called ahead to tell me exactly what time he'd arrive, and then arrived on time. He got the job done, was polite, and answered all our questions. We are very happy with our AHW experience and would highly recommend them to others. We look forward to an ongoing relationship with this fine company."
48849,1,"Really disappointing. Dropped by here on a Friday night with my wife hoping for a good dinner but all we got was marginally decent food that was very pricey.\n\nCocktails were 10 dollars each, not bad, but didn't really taste too good. nothing special.\n\nServers were unpolished. Felt like they were all newly hired.\n\nFood was not that good. New York Strip Steak was a small portion. Tasted all right, but not nearly enough for a young man. Asked for medium rare but got it medium. Wife ordered medium sandwich but got rare. Had to send it back (after waiting for 10 minutes). \n\nOverall, came out to 40 a pop, but was a lackluster meal."
4209,2,Staff here is usually very nice and helpful and not overbearing. Everything is kept nice and tidy. I just feel that this location does lack in variety and sizes...
14761,1,"I came here with my friend for his early birthday dinner.  For $20 all you can eat sushi, I've had better.  There weren't even fillings in the sushi so it was basically 'All You Can Eat' rice. I felt bad for my friend since I chose this place, but that's a note to myself in the future."
7884,2,"I've always been a Kona fan. So when my friend decided on this place for the dinner before her bachelorette party, I knew exactly what to expect.\n\nWe had made a reservation, so they were prepared to accommodate our large group. What they weren't prepared for was how their other customers would feel. They decided to place us next to the railing inside the mall, and while the majority of our group tried to stick to general restaurant etiquette, some of us failed. Those of us that were did a LOT of apologizing to the tables around us. I feel like Kona should have placed us in a more private location, being that we forewarned them that we were a bach party.\n\nOur waiter didn't help the situation either. While he did cater to our ladies shots requests, encouraging things like sake bombs, he was also very sarcastic and rude when it came to everything else. He made a lot of off color jokes and comments about our get ups that weren't \""ha ha\"", but more of \""you're all morons\"". Here's a tip buddy: don't talk down to your customers. Especially ones that are likely going to be your biggest tip of the night. Our less than appropriate waiter had a younger female waitress helping him w/ orders and food delivery. She was awesome. She did her best to make sure everyone tabs were correct and fixed a few order issues that her counterpart had no interest in remedying. Such as asking the bartender for ginger beer for our one lady who foregoes booze. He scoffed at her and went to the next person to order. While our female savor went straight to the bar and brought back the ginger beer w/ an apology and promise that none of her \""beers' would appear on our check.\n\nThe food was really good (this is what I knew to expect). Most of the ladies went between pizzas and sushi, both were enjoyed. Their updated drink menu was very good. We very much enjoyed that you could actually see what the drinks looked like on the iPads that served as drink menus. Some table faves included: raspberry crush, strawberry basil lemonade, pineapple honey mojito, and the strawberry fizz.\n\nAll in all, our experience was good, mainly due to the menu and our female waitress (I WISH I could remember her name). I know the bride will definitely be coming here again. As for me, if I'm in the area I might visit the bar."
10533,0,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. From the moment we checked in, we were treated poorly by the staff - the woman working the front desk asked us to take a seat while she \""saw what she could do\"" about our reservation, even though we had successfully booked it prior to checking in and had the confirmation number in hand. What she actually did was check in every single person in line behind us, not bothering to address our reservation until we interrupted her and asked what was going on (a good 20 minutes later.) I'm not sure how us essentially losing our place in line translated as her \""seeing what she could do.\""\n\nBut it gets worse. We had a few friends visit our room, and apparently the security guards saw them through our window (creepy much?) They proceeded to bust into the room, kicking every person out and searching places as strange as beer bottles for \""anything they should know about.\""\n\nWe talked to the manager about this, who assured us that it was fine to have additional guests as long as they weren't spending the night. I'm not sure if the manager talked to the security guards about their behavior, but it was extremely inappropriate and uncalled for.\n\nIf you want to be treated like a teenager having a party in your parents' house or a felon, then stay here. Their rooms have a nice something-died-in-here scent to set the ambiance, too. Alexis Park should spend more time finding the cause of that smell than searching beer bottles for contraband."
8192,3,"Tonight was my first night checking out the Grotto, and after a bad service experience with another place close by, i was ready to eat anywhere at that point. \n\nI have passed the Grotto many times living in Scottsdale, and have often walked by smelling the aromas grazing my senses while strolling by...i love that they seem to always have their doors/windows open and the tables overlooking the street are fantastic.  \n\nAnyway, as Brett S. said , the service can be a little bad but it is definitely part of the charm.  Anyone who has every been to a real Italian \""joint\"" understands this.  I was almost pleased with how traditional the feeling was, as in \""if you don't like it, get the heck out\"" haha. It was also a very packed Friday night around 730, so i truly expected nothing but a wait anywhere we went, but we at least found a group of down to earth people entering and exiting wearing everything from jeans and a t-shirt like me, golf attire, to going out clothes. No matter your style, they treated you all the same.  Perfect!  (finding a place like that in Scottsdale is hard to do!)\n\nWith it being a Friday night and already having a bad experience with a previous place, i just wanted a square meal and to head home, so i didn't do as much sampling as i would have liked.  We started out with the calamari which came with a marinara sauce with a little kick to it.  It looks like they added red pepper flakes at the end, but it was a nice touch.  I had the house salad with vinaigrette dressing...and word to the wise, if you don't like onions, this salad (at least with the vinaigrette) comes with sneaky chopped marinated red onions in it...so beware! The blue cheese crumbles were a nice touch as well.\n\nMy friend ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo and i chose the cannelloni. The fettuccine was much smaller portioned than i thought it would be, especially in comparison to my dish...so if you're very hungry, i would stray from this dish.  While normally a classic favorite, i didn't quite like the added spices to the dish, which seemed to be an Italian seasoning.  The alfredo sauce alone was to die for though.  The cannelloni was phenomenal.  Everything was cooked to perfection and flavored out of this world. \n\nPlease also note....when this food is done, it's coming to your table, steaming hot! So wait a few before you take your first bite because you'll probably burn your mouth in some way/shape/form! :o)\n\nOverall the Grotto really picked up my night, and being a yankee in a western state...it's nice to have a piece of home right around the corner.  I'll definitely be coming back!"
26357,1,"I was so happy to find a boba place right around the corner so I wouldn't have to drive several miles to Lee Lee's or Asiana if I didn't feel like making my own.  I requested an iced soy latte boba (like I used to get from my old fave Eba Cafe) but they couldn't make a latte.  I settled for an iced green tea with boba (brewed, not powder). \n\nThe boba had a nice, chewy texture but was totally flavorless.  They were also skimpy on the amount of boba that went in the cup.  The tea itself was bitter (my guess is that they let it brew too long).  All in all, I wasted my five bucks on that and won't be going back again."

25891,1,"Unfortunately no one ever asked us how our food was... If they had asked- who knows- maybe they would have made an attempt to be sure we were satisfied! Bizarre rules w/ the menu. For example, \""could I have a side of veggies instead of rice or mashed potato?\"" Response- \""it will cost $6 extra.\"" We did it anyway and were much happier with the grilled zucchini, peppers & mushrooms at an extra $6. I wonder though... Why were there only olives, onions & peppers available in the veggie quesadilla I asked about? Bottom line- I took 2 bites of the tasteless margarita pizza I ordered when the veggie quesadilla sounded too boring, and no one asked if it tasted okay!! Our server also didn't ask if I wanted to take my leftovers with me (is that allowed here? Not sure_ either way though)... I would have let her know I was unhappy. Poor service. Meh food."

This buffet met the challenge. Not only is it beautiful to look at , I am always a sucker for great decor, the food , layout and service complimented the whole deal. \nOur meal included Great Prime Rib,  A larger pastry assortment with well thought out treats, such as small espresso cups of Pot au Chocolate, my fav,  Bread pudding, profiteroles , cakes, puddings and  pretty candied apples.  The areas of the buffet had well seasoned fishes, shrimp cocktail , fruit that was fresh and ripe, lots of sides that looked good but I wanted meat, sweets and such.\nThe waiter was spot on , constantly clearing , refilling  and courteous. \nI was amazed that the line looked huge going in but wasn't very long of a wait. \nI highly recommend The Buffet at Wynn."
10775,2,"Went here to sell a car and perhaps we picked a bad day because they were having their company Christmas party so everyone was distracted.. Anywho the man who helped us was a sweet old man, God bless his heart, BUT he was so slow!!! Haha he was seriously moving at the speed of sloth which is not surprising since he's 82!!! And he kept forgetting things like where he put a piece of paper..  Omg hahaha I LOVE my senior citizens but we didn't want to be stuck there all day.. At one point when we were waiting for the manager's approval he dosed off.. He straight fell asleep and started snoring HAHAHA it was so cute but definitely would irritate an impatient seller/buyer...."
18514,4,This place is great! Always friendly service and they have good facebook deals too!
36866,2,"Went back for lunch; the parmesan fries were delicious, and though I loved the idea of my Big Fat Greek Burger, once again the burger execution left something to be desired. Between the condiments and the soft bun, my burger turned into a soggy mess very quickly, which was a disappointment. I love the service, and I still haven't had a spiked milkshake, but Winghart's serves my burger of choice in the 'Burgh."
20208,0,Never eating at a Denny's in Vegas again.. I thought it was just the Denny's on fort apache and trop but I guess it's this one as well.. First of all the establishment is filthy! They need a surprise health inspection ASAP! My glass came out with lipstick on it so I asked for another glass and the server just looked at me like I ugh.. Okay!?! Then our food came out and it was swimming in oil.. Hmmm yummy! Then I notice hair in my food =\\  can you say gross! After that I completely lost my appetite.. Never again..
41650,1,"I haven't had dim sum in a while so my husband and I came here to satisfy my long-awaited dim sum craving. We went on a Sunday before noon. No wait. First impression - I like that the restaurant feels inviting. One spacious, modern, open room, not a hole in the wall.\n\nTo my dismay, my feelings changed as soon as I tried some of the dishes. The food was disappointing. I regretted my craving choice. Most of the things we ordered were cold or just awful. The worst one was the beef spare ribs. So greasy, fatty, gummy, and boney. My shrimp wontons were cold. Chow fun were short pieces and dry, just the opposite of how I like them. Those ribs left a horrible taste in my mouth the whole day. The only thing that were decent were the shu mai and the shrimp flat rice noodle.\n\nOther saving graces were the decor, no wait, and the excellent service even though I'm not Chinese. The dim sum ladies were nice, explained what some of the items are, the server checked up on us, etc. \n\nOur bill was $38 for two before tip."
17967,1,"I added another star for their breakfasts. If you up for this, it's worth the $5.00 per person."
29209,2,"Imortant: if you are traveling from JFK on Delta make sure you check your gate. If you are at the C gate, they will have to bus you to your gate. Get there early or you will miss your flight.  Great stewards, free overhead bag, & not too extensive food. I'm digging them."
45792,0,"This review is not about the food so much as it is about the service.\n\nHere are my main complaints:\n1. When I ordered my donuts, I was informed that I would have to wait a few mins for fresh glaze donuts.  That's fine.  My problem was that after I had paid for my order, I still didn't have my donuts. They were sitting on the counter because the girl had forgotten about them.  I had to remind another employee that I was waiting for my donuts.\n2. When we were being rung up, I had to repeat what we had several times.  I told her we had iced coffees but she thought we had brewed coffees.\n3.  The girl making our iced coffees made mine too watery with too much milk and it was warm on top of that.  \n\nFor them being open a month, they still have a long ways to go in customer service."
30811,3,I had a great time here. Lost my money on a Ladybug penny machine and had some drinks. If you like casinos you will like it if you don't like them then you won't like it. The place is beautiful and overlooks the water.
32713,4,"Amazing!!! I tried their Nutella-banana-nut crepe at the Old Town Farmers Market in Scottsdale, AZ and it was simply the best Nutella Crepe I've ever had. Keep it up!"
21047,4,I really like this place !!! The taste is good but I like people there. The servers look like they are brothers but all are very quiet but kind and don't bother you with over kindness. And their boba tea is the best in town !!!!
5380,3,This place is very good and has good quality and service and great cocktails.
19101,4,"I'll be honest, I hate going to the bank. Totally hate it. But as far as banks go, this place is top notch. The staff is professional and courteous. The service is always a step above. If you have to bank (and we all do), you might as well bank here."
9319,3,"Small quaint little airport. Pretty nice not the fanciest. You can gamble if you like there. Luggage is weird. You have to take a train to another area to get your luggage. Shuttle to the strip is easy and cheap, 7 dollars one way. Better then driving and cheaper and more relaxing."
49715,0,Save your time and money. Sandwiches were bland at best. They offer no kids sandwiches nor will they customize a order to suit a child ( add lettuce and mayonnaise to a four dollar sandwich that comes with bread and meat only) All they had to say as well that's corporate for you. Apparently they're so freakishly fast because they cut every customer service corner they can. I personally will never step foot in a Jimmy John's again and I highly recommend you do the same.
4122,3,"oOoh been here once for dinner and about three times for lunch...it's really a great place for a quick and easy meal and it's not too fatty like other fast foods..and it's pretty cheap. \n\nI love their 3 piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread (I'm usually not fond of cornbread) and two choices of sides. I've had the creamed spinach, corn, veggie mix, squash mix, roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite....the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste...so not a big fan of that one..other than that the other sides are pretty good. The meatloaf meal is also really good...two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread...2 bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken. heh\n\nSo for a quick easy cheap semi-healthy meal that does not consist of a hand full of grease (burgers, pizza, tacos of that sort..) then Boston Market is really a fantastic choice =)\n\nYummers!"
32251,3,"The fried chicken here is really good - better than popeyes! I liked the green beans and the fact that they serve breakfast all day (even though I have sworn not to eat any of that fatty, artery-clogging, biscuit-egg goodness). The sweet tea here is also pretty legendary as they have so clearly advertised. \n\n4 stars just because my arteries are clogged and I'm struggling to get out of this Bojangles food coma right now."
35477,4,"By far one of the Top 5 poker rooms in Las Vegas. Plenty of tables, good action, and good overall room. My go to spot."
35414,0,"Very small theaters, even for a new movie just out. If you dont make it to the showtime at least 5-10 mins before it starts you end up in the front section looking straight upward the whole movie. Nice that there are eating options in sunset station, but drink refills even cost, after you've already spent $14+ for drink and"
9330,1,"I really didn't like this airport.\n\nAside from the fact that it's Vegas and there are slot machines everywhere. The airport doesn't have electrical outlets next to seats or on them. Or even charging stations near the terminals. There's a separated little area for people to charge but it's not near their terminal and there isn't decent seating that people are sleeping, and sitting all over the place. This airport is a mess and given how much money they must be making, they can do better.\n\nI did want to mention that the free wi-fi is very helpful, but it isn't if you have to sit on the floor to charge your laptop far far away from your terminal so you can't even see the updated boarding time.\n\nThe food inside this airport is pretty bad too and I honestly don't really understand why. Everywhere is better than the Vegas airport, why???\n\nThey really need to improve everything here."
42429,2,"Good food that fills you up quickly, like their prices too."
44993,4,"Came here with friends for a birthday dessert. Quaint atmosphere with very attentive staff. Tried the Strawberry Kiss, Chocolate Brownie, and profiteroles. Hella good."
25116,0,"I never rate on Yelp due to horrendous service but I feel like everyone should be warned. We sat down and ordered 15 minutes later, got our salads then waited an hour before we noticed our food was not at the table yet. After addressing it with the manager she said it would be ANOTHER 40 minutes and was not apologetic and had informed us that our server should have told us it was 1.5 wait for our pizza.  This place is seriously unorganized and is in desperate need of a staff revamp. We couldn't wait because we had an event so all 9 of us had to leave. They still charged us for our alcohol. This is the worst dining experience I have ever encountered and will never be eating at this location EVER AGAIN.  This location needs a serious reality check, you are running your business to the ground!"
39034,4,"Just back from lunch . First time at Famous Dave's . I'm not a bar b q person but thought we would give it a try. Was it great!,, service was top of the line to match the food! Will be back for more! The ribs melt in your mouth,a must try"
6761,4,"By far, the best pizza pies in Madison. Their crust and sauces are exceptional. This Italian joint is decidedly old school. Cheese is spread and calories and fat phobes are not spared. \n\nMuch of the staff is young, but are all friendly enough. However, you don't come here too feed your ego ... just your face. \n\nRosati's has a massive menu, but you cannot go wrong with any of it. In fact, if you order their sensational Italian sausage, you can't help but go right. \n\nEat up and leave your calorie counter at home ... or else it may explode."
7638,4,"Barro's is always awesome. When I call in an order its usually ready faster than they say it will be, and their meatball pizza is delicious."
42321,3,"We liked this place for the food and that it is convenient to our house. YAY! Very small place that looks more like a take out joint than a sit down restaurant although there are seating available. We were expecting a restaurant and when we saw how small the place it was we were afraid the food would not be good as in restaurant quality Boy were we wrong! And glad it is what it is as I look forward to coming back and getting wraps to go if I am in a bind. I had the gyro wrap. My son had the falafel wrap. He also wanted hummus and lucky for him it was part of the falafel wrap. My husband had an entree which included  tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush. Everything was delicious and authentic. Hey, I am not Mediterrean but grew up in NY. I had my share of ethnic cuisine to say that Jerusalem Cafe is the real deal. We also had pistachio baklava after our meal. Excellent as well."
5420,0,"If you want a doctor and staff who doesn't make you feel uncomfortable and won't make you dread having to take your child in for a visit, do not go here. I was a month late taking my infant daughter at the time to take her shots and Dr. Nauman would make a negative comment towards me for being late. I never felt comfortable going there. I wish I had found Dr. Marlon Mendoza much sooner."
5430,4,We've been here a couple of times.  Food is always good and so is the service. We'll definitely be back.
33686,1,"I live in San Diego and sent flowers to one of our employees working in Las Vegas whose father had passed.The employee did receive the flowers and she said they were beautiful, so I was pleased about that. BUT- he never sent me a receipt as requested and I have called 3 or 4 times to ask for one. Always I get a voicemail greeting and never do I get a call back. It is extremely frustrating. I would be happy to give more stars if I could actually get someone from this business on the phone and a receipt in my hand so I can get reimbursed for the purchase. Has anyone else had trouble reaching this business or getting a call back???"
6881,1,"This rating does NOT reflect the fabulous selection at The Bean--that's amazing. I was irritated by the customer service. It STARTED well, with a lady greeting me as I came in the door and asking if I needed help finding anything. When I said no, the lady walked over to her associate, and the two proceeded to engage in an epic--riveting, I'm SURE--conversation that was still going on 10 minutes later, which is when I walked (unnoticed) out the door. The conversation transpired in the middle of a crowed aisle, which I, along with another patron, were having no small amount of difficulty navigating. The two were completely oblivious to the fact that we were trying to see (and move) PAST them. When the other patron met my eyes and shook her head in bewilderment, my suspicion that this is NOT normal behavior for business proprietors was confirmed. I didn't stick around any longer. I found what I needed at JoAnn's right around the corner."
10802,1,"Had high expectation, so wanted to like this place, was quite disappointed. So so service, ok ambience, food was bad. A good test is how well the lamb kebab is prepared, I had to send it back and get something else as it was super chewy like rubber, disappointing!"
30390,4,The ph\u00f2 is so good! The decor and feel of the restaurant was nice too. Servers were friendly. It was a nice experience for my first time here :)
42770,0,Slooww service! 2 barbers there at the time. Instead of them hustling to get the people out they take their sweet time. For every 3 haircuts the guy did the lady did one. And all she did was talk and shave over the same spot 30000 times. And once the guy finished he left and said brb. Leaving one barber and like 8 people waiting. For the time I was there I saw like 5 people sign in and leave. \n\nI won't returning here!
2757,4,"I love, love, love Chevy's.  Their chips and salsa and the best.  The chips are warm and thin and the salsa is fire roasted.  The entrees are tasty as well but I could easily make a full meal out of the chips and salsa."
49263,2,"Great, friendly and attentive service. We had the Caesar salad, duck & scallops. Salad was great, duck was good & very rich. Scallops were so-so & not something I'd recommend ordering. Over all an okay meal, but not one I'd repeat."
22900,4,"Golden Spoon is so much better than all the self-serve frozen yogurt shops in the valley.  It's the original of the modern \""fro-yo\"" craze in the valley, and remains the best.\n\nNot only is the yogurt more flavorful and more solid, but you also get a lot more for your money.  Golden Spoon charges by the size, not the ounce, and the employees are very generous about the amount they pour into your cup.  They have no problem letting you sample flavors, and they mix however many you like.  And unlike the self-serve places, the yogurt doesn't look like a giant glob in an oversized bowl by the time you sit down to eat it.\n\nThe only negative is that you may be dealing with a line during busy hours as you wait for the employees. \n\nAnd yes, the plastic spoons are colored gold."
37833,2,"I don't know why people rave about Wicked Spoon so much.  I've come here for both lunch and dinner and the food is okay.  The kalbi ribs, beet salad, and bone marrow are the go to dishes.  I much prefer Wynn, or the new buffet at Caesar's"
38938,3,"This place lives up to the hype. Took a star off for one thing: the wait can be interminably long and the waiting area is small.  When you walk in, it's very hard to figure out who has already submitted their name and who is in line for the hostess.  It's also really cramped there.\n\nWe sat at the sushi bar and got the AYCE.  The sushi man behind the counter was very impressive.  My husband rattled off about 10 different nigiri and roll items and the guy didn't write any of them down.  I thought for sure he would forget some of the items, but that guy whipped them out like nobody's business.\n\nThe fish is fresh and tasty, and nigiri is really the way to go here.  The rolls are good, but the two we tried had a little too much going on and the flavors got lost in the jumble.\n\nP.S. The pork belly is part of the AYCE.  We didn't find that out until the very end!  If we had known, we would have ordered some!"
8001,3,I have to say I am a fan! The Stetson Chopped salad has got me hooked on this place. I literally get it go once a week! I have taken pretty much everyone I know here just to get this salad! \n\nThe Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry is also a great choice! If you still have a sweet tooth at the end of your meal definitely try the Apple Cobbler with brie cheese crema and duck fat ice cream! WOW its truly amazing and so different from any apple cobbler I've ever tasted. \n\nThe service here is always great and they are friendly and quick!
4270,2,Came here for my sisters birthday dinner. It was a good time. My sister got the coconut shrimp dinner with a side lobster tail. She said it was all great.\n\nMy other sister got some kind of a chicken dinner with mashed potatoes. Her potatoes had cold spots throughout them but she said the chicken was good.\n\nI got the prime rib and it had the potential to be good but it was cooked to well. I told our waiter that I liked it really pink and he said to order it medium then. It came with no pink but it was tender along the outside. The middle was dry and chewy. The horseradish cream was really really good. \n\nI will give this place another try but I would send my dinner back next time if they did not cook the meat how I asked. I'm sure if I had said something they would have taken care of it. When your out to dinner for a celebration you just don't want anything to spoil it though.
13714,1,"So overrated. I was so disappointed.\n\nIf you plan on eating buffets on the strip, start with this one and end with the Wynn Buffet. We did the opposite, and oh how sad I was. The atmosphere is meh and the food was ok. I guess it wasn't that bad considering it was only $20, but for that I could have gotten a delicious breakfast at the Hash House A Go Go and been much happier."
22544,4,"My boyfriend took me to Roka for dinner last night for my first experience with delicious Sushi. We ordered the vegetable tempura, sweet potatoes, and sweet corn which were all delightful. Additionally, I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon and my boyfriend ordered the California Roll and Sashimi Chef Selection. My dish was perfectly delicious and Tim enjoyed his dinner as he always does when he visits Roka. \nThis turned out to be one of my favorite dinners out in quite some time!"
25270,2,"Cool restaurant in the heart of \""The Village\"". I had a great experience, and would recommend it to adults. You can have great fun especially during the summer."
15449,2,"I miss Dim Sum. New Orleans is not a place to live if it's a staple in your diet. I loved the hustle and bustle of Asian familes and the harried staff. The dumplings themselves were good, the tea piping hot, but wished we had ordered some broccoli.\n\nThat is all."
7270,0,"Can I give 0 stars?  When I walked into the showroom,  the salesman approached me with an attitude that I was bothering him!  I asked for the best price OTD on the motorcycle I wanted and he gave me a price that was 10% ($700) higher than the price I was quoted with Western Honda.  I told the salesman that price is high and he said \""Go buy it from Western Honda\""  He did not bother to ask me if I was paying cash (which I was) or try to add incentives to encourage me to buy from him.  I have never dealt with a salesman like that in my life (and I am no spring chicken).   If they treat everyone this way, I wonder how they sell anything!  Don't waste your time, as far as salesmanship - total incompetence.  By the way, he lied to me about the price they had advertised online.  Dishonest and rude, if that is what you are looking for, by all means visit this shop.  The salesman was a total dufus and you can get a much better deal on a Honda with Western Honda.  I wish I had the salesman's name, but of course he did not bother to introduce himself.  He was an older gentleman in the first office on the left."
20625,2,Loved the shepherd's pie.  Waitress was good and attentive.  I love Irish bars.  I think it's best place I have gone to for a place on Fremont Street.
26035,4,"My husband and I celebrated our 43rd Wedding Anniversary at Flemings in Peoria and from the moment we entered the door and was greeted with \""Happy Anniversary!\"" by the smiling receptionist, our whole experience went North from there! The wait staff wishing us Happy Anniversary, our server, Jose, paying particular attention to our needs, the manager presenting us with a gift card,  Jose snapping our picture and bringing over the \""memorable moment\"" keepsake photo, the gift box of chocolates...oh wait...did I mention our perfectly prepared dinner selections?  I cannot say enough good things about our experience. We were treated like Royalty and I want to share our thanks with everyone who made our night so wonderful!!!"
3920,0,"I got food poisoning after eating at this location, I almost went to the hospital after about 12hrs of vomiting and diarrhea. I will NEVER eat Arby's again"
8640,1,"I used to really enjoy this place and have had tons of fun here. Cheap drinks, enjoy some of the staff, good specials, trashy and divey. I enjoy all those things. After the last couple visits, but especially tonight, I'm sure I won't be back. \nMe and one of my girlfriends wanted to go get a beer and a bite to eat after work tonight. I suggested Dos Gringos. She got there first and said they didn't appear to be open. Hm, weird. So I said the Vine. We used to frequent this place often, but now its once in a blue moon. \nIt was pretty dead inside, which we were ok with. We sat at the bar. We ordered our beers and asked for menus. She ordered the special of chicken fingers and fries, I got a 1/2 order of nachos with chicken added. The food came out pretty fast, which was nice. We were hungry. My friend seemed to enjoy her food. Mine, oh man... These have got to be the worst nachos I've ever seen in my entire life. It was basically chips with big pieces of chewy, dry, bland chicken on top with salsa and sour cream on the side. Very  little chips and salsa on the side. To find a chip with cheese or refried beans on it was very rare. How can you fuck up nachos??? I'm not sure, but they did. Badly. \nSo yeah, food totally sucked. I ate it. What sucks worse then having terrible food when this hungry? Shit service. In a dead bar. Yes, that happened as well.  Absolutely awful service tonight. I didn't even want to tip the guy, but I did. Yes, I ate my food (or a quarter of it), but I did feel it necessary to mention how much I didn't enjoy it, he didn't give 2 shits. He said with a smartass voice that he was sorry with his back turned and walking away from me. Ugh. I'm so angry at The Vine for allowing such low standards when it used to be a great place to go.\n$13 with tip for 1 beer and the worst nachos I've ever put in my mouth is way too much money!!!! I've decided at the end, right now, me returning won't happen for sure. I don't deal well with bad service like that!"
12158,0,"This gym is the worst, and I am so happy to be done with it. \n\nI joined here a few years ago because I got a significant discount from my apartment building. I had previously been a member of Pinnacle on the square and liked it a lot, but the $35 less a month membership was significant enough to make the switch. It was a mistake.\n\nThe gym itself is organized into multiple levels. While cool at first, it makes it really inconvenient, especially for weight lifting. The weight rooms are split between two levels, and each level only contains one of each type of equipment (squat rack, bench, etc). If someone is using the squat rack on the main level, and you need to use it, you have to go downstairs, but often times, that one is being used too. You spend the majority of your workout walking back and forth between the two weight rooms trying to find an open piece of equipment.\n\nAnd that brings me to a major problem with the gym. It's too crowded. The owners don't care how many people they admit to the gym (the more the better in their minds), so if you try to work out during peak time (5 - 8pm), you're going to have a miserable experience. I honestly couldn't get through the majority of my lifting routines because equipment was always taken. I eventually had to start cutting out of work and coming in at 2pm on weekdays, just so I could do a full lifting routine. It's even worse in January, where I kid you not, there isn't one piece of cardio equipment open (this slows down after the New Year, but it's still really unacceptable). \n\nThe front desk staff are all unfriendly and they clearly hate their jobs (I don't blame them). The gym smells awful and is wayyyy too humid (especially in the basement). The rubber flooring in the weight rooms is usually in pieces and rising up from the floor (probably due to the humidity). \n\nThe gym is just a giant mess. Seriously, pay the extra $30 a month and join Pinnacle on the square. Working out requires motivation enough, and having to work out in a miserable environment makes it even more difficult to stay motivated.\n\nI'm very happy to have moved away and leave Capital Fitness."
36087,4,"Seriously, thanks to the Mexican food gods for real tacos just off State Street. Chipotle, your necessity has been eliminated. I will forever be a Taqueria Guadalajara fan, but when on campus or downtown, this place cannot be beat for authentic Mexican food.\n\nAnd please, don't go to a Mexican place and order a burrito or a steak quesadilla. It's about the tacos (that should always have cilantro and onions), and the gorditas, and the sopes, and the tostadas. Kind of excited to try the chorizo/potato option next time around. I love sopes, and while these are different than the TG version, they are also very good. Thick, fried (?) corn-pita type things topped with your choice of meat plus lettuce, tomato and avocado. Yum. \n\nThey have good chips and salsa too. Ask for the bottled salsa too, as it's spicier and a little more interesting than the standard pico de gallo. Also have to love getting a filling lunch for 5 or 6 bucks. The servers are really nice and helpful as well."
21898,3,Birthday party for my son and a bunch of his buddies. The boys really enjoyed the arcade games and all of them said that the food was great. Our waitress Jessie was awesome!!
809,4,Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard.
42741,3,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Upon check in the staff was courteous enough to give us a complimentary upgrade to a lake view room for my fiances birthday. I really liked our view (see picture). We didn't get a map of the property at first so we didn't know where our room was until we asked the bell hop. You're on the 4th floor at the main lobby so just remember that.. The beds were super comfortable and the bathroom soaps were delightful! There are no microwaves in the rooms, heads up but the food from the restaurant is pretty good. We had the pizza, it was delicious and the breakfast buffet was nice. There's an omelette and waffle station that could get a little backed up but it's worth it they're really good!! The servers were very nice as well. The Dominican Server we had.. Jose, I believe is his name? He always seemed to be around with a warm friendly smile. He served us both at the breakfast restaurant and at the pool area. He def stays busy and does a wonderful job at it all he deserves a raise! Please don't make any phone calls from the hotel it's extremely expensive! Overall we enjoyed relaxing at the pool although, I understand it's not summer or anything but the pool closed around 5pm that bummed us out a lil but we loved the water slide! The resort is lovely and the free kayak rentals were fun! I highly recommend this place if you're trying to stay away from the craziness if the strip and relax but also not be to far away to drive to it too. The area is really nice and the free shuttle gets full fast so book ahead in advance! Thanks westin lake Las Vegas for an amazing mini vacation! And for the complimentary bday champagne!"
21651,3,"I doubt I can say anything that hasn't already been written. It is a great NY style deli located in the middle of Arizona- sort of. \n\nEvery time I have eaten at Chompies it has been a very good experience. I have only gone during weekdays so I never really had to wait. The service is always friendly. The sandwiches are always piled high with meat and there are a lot of options to select from. It is difficult not to figure out something that you like. \n\nIt is a little pricey, that would be the only draw back, but I never left where I wasn't stuffed."
13555,1,"I wanted to enjoy pure but it was disappointing from the beginning. We waited for over an hour to get in even though my group had 6 females and 3 guys. They complained of the ratio EVEN though they kept marching in hordes of guys. Inside the club I would see at least 5 guys for every girl that walked by. The floor was sticky and the bartenders and staff were slow and unfriendly. The only good things about Pure was the roof lounge and the fact I made $50 in cash from some \""high roller\"" in the VIP making it \""rain\"" dollar bills throughout the night. I would never pay to get into this club but at least I made $50."
46757,4,I've been feeling under the weather all week and figured what better way to get a pick me up than my favorite Vietnamese spot? We walked in and noticed they've got some new seating. Beautiful booths! I love the decor and atmosphere in this place and the staff are just the best. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the beef stew with bread (his favorite) and I had the pho with dumplings. The broth in the pho is delicious and comforting like a warm hug. Every time I eat it I wonder why I don't eat it every day.
7625,3,"This is great! I've never had so much fun! We rented tubes and made sure to bring sheets to cover the tubes (so you don't burn because they are black) or bring your own light colored tubes). We also brought coolers with food and drinks (you can bring beer, too I think). There were a few rapids where we went down really fast which was great! People throw marshmallows. I got a great tan, make sure to get spray on sunscreen. There is 1 restroom down the river. I'd recommend avoiding spring break because college students will flash (men & women)."
49952,0,"I went into here this past Friday thinking to myself chicken and donuts how unique is that; makes one think of a LoLo's spinoff. I spent rounded up $9.00 on a chicken thigh and drumstick with a cucumber salad. Not only was it overpriced for those two pieces, but it look as if the chicken was cooked too fast in old oil and not long enough. When I bite into the chicken it had an aftertaste and was pink with a tinge of blood inside. I expected more from an establishment serving food. When I tried to contact them shortly after the blood tinged chicken my call went unanswered after several attempts."
32748,3,"Love this place! Eating there isn't the greatest, customer service isn't always great, but the food is amazing! From kabobs to falafels, you can't go wrong. We like to order the combo for two, which is really more appropriate for 3-4 people and it's cheap too. They give you SOOOO much food for what you pay when you get the combo. The chicken kabobs are another favorite of mine. The meal comes with yellow rice too & I love me some yellow rice! The delivery driver is super nice and they deliver late. Try it out!"
48328,4,"This is a fun place to go. The owner bubbles with enthusiasm and will be very happy to discuss her dishes as much as you like. Our party of four had pig ears, chicken Algarve (thin chicken filet with cheese and mushrooms and spices, baked chicken, and chicken on a shish kabob; the first chicken dish and the pig ears were the best in terms of flavors. Unfortunately, they were out of the Portuguese Chorizo and we didn't try any of the more exotic dishes. Everyone liked everything. I plan to go back and try some of their seafood dishes. \n\nI notice reviews cover the spectrum on the Sangria. The owner asked us if we would like a liter of Sangria which is a tad more than quart. We're not big drinkers and we hesitated. The owner assured us it was a light drink; she said she just put a little port wine in and no Vodka; she acted like making Sangria with Vodka was very unauthentic. So the four of us shared a liter of Sangria. The Sangria tastes good but I judged the alcohol content to be substantially less than that of a typical red wine. So order the Sangria if you would like a light alcohol drink with great flavor and order wine if you want something with more bite. \n\nWhen we ordered, the owner told us that one of the dishes would take at least 35 minutes since it was being made from scratch. We were up for a leisurely Sunday evening meal with good company so that was not a problem for us and spent about an hour and twenty minutes there. Of course, if you are on a tighter schedule, ask what can be prepared fast. \n\nService was attentive without the waitresses introducing themselves and announcing that they would be taking care of us that evening. I prefer it that way.  \n\nI decided on five stars based the pig ears and chicken Algarve, nice atmosphere, leisurely but attentive service and a modest bill: $59 for the four us with tax but before the tip and there was more than enough food."

46168,4,I'm on my feet all day in heels. I get massages on a monthly bases to ease the pain on my back and the stress I carry on my neck/shoulder. I was a little hesitant about chiropractic at first but Dr. Noggle eased my worries. She is very easy to talk to and explain everything; answers any questions I had. Now I see her ones a week to help realign my back so I can continue wearing high heels :). The added bonus afterwards is you sleep well at night. The price is great and the place is convenient. No appointment necessary. Walk in when ever I find the time in my hectic schedule. The office staff are friendly and offers water when you walk in. The place is very clean. I highly recommend the Joint and visit Dr. Noggle.
17410,1,"I really don't like AMC very much. I prefer Harkins and even Cinemark to AMC. So I went and saw a movie here yesterday with my mom and sister in law and it was fine, the movie was good. That really has nothing to do with the theatre, but it helps. I guess my main complaint with AMC is their concessions. They are really expensive and not very good. The popcorn is expensive and it's not good. They have the do it yourself butter which is terrible because then you can't get any butter in the middle of the popcorn and about 10 minutes into the movie the popcorn is all dry and sticks in your throat. Although, this may be a good thing because their butter tastes weird... like a little fishy. yuck. Anyway, I just think there are better theatres out there (like any other type of theatre....). I understand this may just be convenient or you may have a gift card to AMC (like we did), but it's just meh."
15613,2,"This place was pretty good! My husband and I got a take out order and were very happy with it. That was probably one of the best chili rellenos I've had. I was disappointed with the veggie salad, however, as it was mostly just lettuce. The black beans were pretty spicy and salty, so plan on having something to mix them with like rice or an extra tortilla. I probably wouldn't dine in if I could help it, the dining room isn't very comfy, (free wifi while you wait for your order is nice, though) but I will definitely be getting more take out! \n\nOh, and: a snickerdoodle with every order! A good one, too!"
10243,1,"My rating is for the customer service not the hotel. The hotel was great, good food with a lot of restaurants and Encore pool is a lot of fun. \n\nWhen I checked into the hotel the computer system was down and continued to stay down for quite amount of hours. I tried to get there early to set up the room since I was throwing a bachelorette party but couldn't get in and around 7:15pm I had to go talk to them again since we had dinner reservations at 7:45pm at another hotel and had to get ready still. The only reason they gave me one room key to only one of our rooms is cause I started crying. To top it off they call us at 1am to tell us our other room is ready but yet don't comp us for that night. They had the girls get ready in their spa and then check their luggage back in at the desk. \n\nOverall the only thing they did for us was give us food credit and comp the resort fee. I honestly believe they could have and should have done more for us since we only got one room at a time and the second room that was ready at 1am wasn't the right one, it only had one bed and the shower didn't work well so we had to have the girls in that room switch rooms again on Sat to one with two beds. \n\nThere was a lot of inconveniences at this hotel that I wouldn't have expected and will not stay there again because of this. There are plenty of other nice hotels that aren't as expensive and will treat you a lot better."
21695,3,"If you read my review regarding LAX in Hollywood, you would know that I hated it mainly because I didn't get in after standing in line for 2 hours.\n\nTHIS time, however, I waited in line for less than an hour AND got in for free thanks to our Luxor room key card.  I highly suggest staying at the Luxor hotel if you plan on hitting this club up, especially if there is a special event going on.  That night I got to see Nicole from the Pussycat Dolls sing 3 songs as well as Dwayne Wade making it rain.  I don't remember the latter part because I was too gone to notice.\n\nAs far as the club goes, the dance floor is really small and you have to fight for a spot.  Once you have enough drinks in you, this will of little significance, especially if you have other friends making room for you to dance.  It was really easy to buy a drink and the bars were not that crowded at all.  I had a really great time but it was mostly because of the intoxicated state.  Otherwise, I would probably give this club 2 or maybe 3 stars for ease of buying a drink and crowd."
47962,4,"Awesome place! Lauren is the best! Great service! Love the drinks, most definitely will go for seconds!"
45562,0,"Ok I know it's in an airport. But this was by far the most flavor less, bland Asian food I've ever had! Bland and Asian rarely go together.  But this food had NONE. Let me be specific. I ordered the Beef bowl. They claim it was marinated. But in what? Must have been water. While I don't claim to be a salt a holic, this food was devoid of any salt whatsoever. Even adding salty soy sauce didn't help much.\n\nSo IF you must eat at the Charlotte airport, just go next door to the Carolina BBQ place which is FAR better! Or really any other place other than Blando Grill."
40719,4,"I came to Verde for dinner when in town visiting some friends. It was so good! We were there before 7 so the happy hour special on margaritas were still going on, which we took full advantage of. I had a frozen margarita and it was huge and so very tasty!\n\nWe all decided to order our own tacos for dinner, although the family sharing options were very intriguing as well, especially because they come with sides. I had one fish, one chorizo, and one beef taco. They were all so good. I definitely them all. The fish was tasty and very fresh, the beef was so flavorful (although a big hard to eat as it got so greasy) and the chorizo was perfectly spicy. If I could go back, I might get some sides to go with it, but overall it was delicious.\n\nAlso the chips and salsa - a necessity at any good mexican. A++!!"
31856,4,I really like this place. The service is really good.  The food is awesome. The price is right.  I will be back for sure.

47778,3,"My honey and I came here for the 1st time it was good would defiantly come again, we want to try happy hour or reverse happy hour! :) I had the spicy crispy chicken and he had the Bei Bulgogi both super tasty would defiantly order again but would ask for the Bei Bulgogi spicy next time, service was great too! We'll recommend and come again....."
620,0,I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
20992,2,"Time for an update, and I'm taking away a star for one reason. The food has remained delicious and the lunch specials are priced right (the lamb vindaloo I had there on 4th July was awesome), but there's something that pissed me right off when I ordered takeout recently. Portion size. It's $9-$11 dollars for an 8-oz container of food, depending on what you get. Get three different containers along with rice and a naan and you're almost at $40. That's WAY too expensive, no matter how tasty the food is. I know how to make this stuff (technically, although I have problems achieving the flavour) and I know what the ingredients cost. They're making money hand-over-dot at this place and the final issue I have is that my 8-oz container of chicken makhani was less than half chicken and the rest sauce. See my Tandoori Village review for more information on this. They need to knock their prices WAY down. I want a take-out meal for two and I want it to be under thirty bucks. When I can get three pounds of Chinese food for under $20 (see my review of Chen & Wok in Surprise), paying double that for less food doesn't strike me as a particularly good deal. Don't anyone make the mistake that this place is haute cuisine either. It ain't Gaylords. Not by a long shot. And Gaylords is pretty far from haute cuisine itself."
24333,0,"Terrible customer service, filthy rooms (especially the shower and tub area). My boyfriend and I had to stay here for two months after our home flooded. The insurance company placed us here because there is a kitchenette. First off they were only supposed to charge the insurance companies credit card but they consistently charged my boyfriends card instead, for thousands of dollars. We were locked out of our room four times. On top of it all the room is dirty! The caulking in the tub and shower was black. That only happens when you don't clean it! Never staying here again, even if the house floods!"
41385,3,"As far as fast food chicken goes, Raising Canes takes the cake. There chicken is juicy, succulent and finger lickin' good. Paired with their secret Canes sauce, coleslaw, crinkle cut fries, and a slice of garlic bread, you'll never leave hungry!"
8864,3,"It is always nice to find a place that can make just about any dish with tofu as the main protein. This means a vegetarian like me can choose from any dish on the menu.  Despite this flexibility I tend towards the red curry. I get this as hot as they will make it with out an argument ensuing, which is usually pretty decent on the heat scale. It is a great medley of crisp vegetables in a creamy coconut milk base red curry. The tofu is the fried style which adds an interesting textural variety to the standard tofu.\n\nThe lunch specials come with a small salad, a small soring roll and a little slice of watermelon all in the $7 range. \n\nService is decent, my water received frequent refills as i tend to drink quite a bit with spicy food. \n\nParking here can be a bit tight at high times, and there also may be s small wait. If there is a wait go to the liquor next store to find an amazing beer selection."
32093,1,"Last night was my second time trying Cana, and quite frankly its not worth the money. My boyfriend and I got a pitcher of mojiots, empanadas, and a sorry excuse for a flatbread which was basically three slices of pita bread with a little smudge of melted cheese in the center... no sauce, no flavor. This cost us $75 after tip. We left still starving after a day of laying by the pool in the sun, and grumpy for wasting money. \nThe only reason I gave two stars as opposed to one, is because I saw the bartender totally hook it up in our pitcher of mojito. He probably used half the bacardi bottle on us. \nBut, needless to say, we met up with friends right after this, and immediately walked over to Brio for some hearty pasta, breads, and salads. \nSeriously, go to Firefly if you want tapas, this place is only good for drinks."
11113,4,This place is totally Vegas. Food is wonderful. The atmosphere is old Vegas. The complimentary limo is a bonus. We frequent this joint every time we get a chance when visiting Vegas which is often. There's always a lounge singer which feels oh so Vegas.
35569,3,"Clean Vietnamese places automatically get a 3 star from me. The added homage to the traditional Vietnamese cuisine gives this place a solid 4 star. You know this is \""French Vietnamese\"" by the smell of butter in the air. While waiting in line, I received a free bag of baggette. The sandwiches are honkers in size. One bite of the sandwich and I know this is the place for me. Soft buttery exterior mixed with pickled daikons and well marinated meat.  I like the boba style sealed coffee because it's easy for transportation. \n\nButter, Butter, Nom Nom!"
29337,4,"I heart me some DD.\nBeing from the East Coast, living in CA, I miss my Dunkin Donuts like crazy, but LV made me happy by having a Dunkin Donuts for my coffee pleasure.\n\nWe went through the drive thru (a DD with a drive thru!), ordered a few donuts, and a couple of cups of coffee before our drive back to CA.\n\nHe got my iced coffee order wrong, but happily replaced it with what I wanted.  Donuts were eaten very quickly in the backseat, as I sipped my coffee most of the way back to CA."
35230,2,"The place has a cool atmosphere and people are generally nice but beware of the incredibly slippy tile floors - not even kidding. Also, the area with the DJ is far too small so don't expect to stay on the dance floor unless you want to feel like a sardine"
32293,4,Great little family bakery with great pastry and juices.  The owners are so nice and passionate about what they do.  Can't wait to come back.  Really love their empanadas.
2874,0,"I'm glad others have had good experiences here because I sure did not.  I went in to get my nails done for a special occasion.  I was so disappointed.  My nails were not smooth, 2 were on crooked and the owners didn't seem to really care that much that I was not satisfied.  Besides the language barrier, they didn't seem to understand that my nails were not on straight.  I wanted them nice and long for my special occasion but due to the screw up, I ended up with short stubby nails.  I have friends who go to the salon but there nails do not last as long as mine do from the place I go now and my friends who have their nails done here have had nails break, something I've never had.  I won't go back and give them the chance to screw up my nails again.  \n\nOne thing, they are cheap.  But then you get what you paid for too.  If I want nice nails that last longer than a few days or a week, I go elsewhere.  There nails are cheap, but they aren't worth the hassle."
31031,1,"I had high hopes for this place.  I mean really, Emeril Lagasse and hyped as  \""the best sports experience in Las Vegas\"" pumped me up for the visit.  Man was I disappointed.  The best thing I can say about this place is they have televisions at each table and just about everywhere you look.   Other than that, there is no comfort feel to this restaurant/sports book.  The menu is over priced.  Based on my experience at other Emeril locations, I expected creative twists on bar favorties.  However, there is little creativity here. The menu items are basic traditional fare with little or no \""bam\"" that Emeril is famous for.  It almost seems like they slapped Emeril's name on the restaurant and added one or two pseudo emeril meal choices just to get people in the door.  I will say that it is easy to place bets here and you won't miss any of the action but I expected much much more."
27122,2,"The good things about City Cafe: their breakfasts, their pool table, their beer pitchers (which save you a few quid), their nice atmosphere which has the American diner feel down. Their big burger challenge, though it is painful to watch let alone attempt. Their chips which come in their own little wire fry baskets.\n\nThe bad things: their cocktail pitchers are very, very weak. You could drink from them all evening and only get mildly buzzed (this was my experience with their elderflower one, their long island iced tea, and their Pimms). Their food is odd. Their nachos would be OK, except that their guacamole tastes exactly like mayonnaise. I once had their veggie burger as well, and something in the way the cheese on top of the patty stuck to the upper bun made said bun go extremely soggy and frothy in an extremely unappetising way. It was liquid bun by the time I neared the end. This burger inspired me to make a yelp account.\n\nThat being said, I go there a lot and will probably continue to do so. But I will stick to pints and chips."
36585,3,"Located at the corner of S. Jones and Spring Mountain near the 168 Market, this small humble eatery provides a comprehensive array of Taiwanese breakfast items that elicit childhood nostalgia for many 1st generation Taiwanese/Chinese folks and are definitely on the must-eat list for those of us second-generation folks who have been fortunate to have made a pilgrimmage back to Taiwan (or as I like to call it, Foodie Island).  \n\nSoybean milk-  this is not the chalky stuff that you find in your supermarket that adds a nice dimension to your latte or cereal, this is enjoyed straight up either as a sweetened cold/hot beverage or in a savory form where a shot of vinegar and soy triggers a reaction so that the soymilk takes on a creamy custardization accented by little bits of green onion and pickled veggies.  For those with discernible palates, I've been informed by reputable sources that the soybean milk across the street at China Mama is superior.\n\nRice Ball (Fan Twan)- a classic item my parents used to grab on the go while heading to school, don't be fooled by the simple name.  This is steamed sticky rice enclosing a savory deep fried chinese doughnut and pork sung.  The ratio of the rice and filling is perfect and it's as classic a combination as pb and j.\n\nTemple meatball (Ba Wan)-  not sure if there are any other places in town that offer this, and fortunately they make a wonderful version of this popular street food item.    Finely chopped mushrooms, bamboo, and stir-fried pork encased by a glutinous tapioca flour bun and bathed in a thick orange sweet savory sauce that has an additional note similar to cinnamon/star anise, this one will flood your head with umami and makes me think if boba and dim sum were to conceive a rockstar child, this would be it.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle soup-   Served piping hot and can easily feed 2 or more, the meat is impeccably braised and comes with garnishes of pickled mustard greens, cilantro, scallions, and bok choy.  Detractors might say it is on the oily side and is way spicy (in which case the version at Noodle Pot may be closer to your liking), otherwise this one punches you in the face and is not shy on flavor in the best way possible.\n\nLeek Pancake- A deep-fried empanada filled with garlic chives, scrambled egg, tofu, and mung bean noodles, this is a tasty rendition if you really like garlic chives.\n\nItems that have room for improvement include the savory chinese doughnuts (yiotiao) and the sesame bun (sao bing) which I found to be a tad bit on the dry side, and the hunk of pork in the pork bun (gua bao) is also a bit oversized and lacking unctuousness (Sheridan Su does a better rendition at Great Bao which is now Fat Choy).  Looking forward to trying the pork chop with rice, sweet tofu custard (do hua), and the lotus wrapped tamales (taiwanese and shanghainese varieties available) on future visits. \n\nNot sure if this is an outpost of Yi Mei Deli Co. in Rowland Heights, CA (the fonts on the food signs look similar), but if you're expecting the same level of quality, it may come up short since they set the bar extremely high, otherwise it's a great primer on Taiwanese cuisine for the uninitiated.  Unbelievable value for your wallet but don't forget cash if you're spending under $10 and they accept visa/mastercard but no amex."
44248,3,"The only car wash I will go to.  Extremely friendly service every time. They are fast,  efficient,  and cheap.\n\nYou can't go wrong here with a $3 car wash."
15767,3,"This place is amazing. I love that there is a show room. I've even taken out of town guests here and they had a blast.\n\nI seldom walk through the showroom anymore, not because it isn't cool looking at the furniture and little lives that you can see in the rooms that are created, but it just takes forever when you just want to pick up some new guest towels.\n\nthis is my $500 store. I always spent around that when I go, best intentions are thrown out the window. I can't help myself.\n\nI read some of the other reviews. I'm always a little blown away at complaints for a contract that someone signs or complaints about delivery times, if you KNOW the time table, then be there.\n\nI've gotten a broken dresser and bed side table from IKEA before, it was a pain wrestling the already open boxes into the car and then into the store, but the 90 minute wait to be seen was a bit of a stretch, its like they were working in the returns department at a snails pace. But they were good about replacing the broken pieces.\n\nI also really prefer to go during the week,  during normal business hours. This place is a MAD HOUSE on the weekend, I'm not a huge fan of \""touching crowds\"" (where you don't have room to maneuver without touching people or constantly excusing yourself) and this happens to often on the weekends at IKEA. It won't stop me, but it is a preference.\n\nIts cool that they have a cafe, for breakfast or lunch and you can drop your potty trained kids off at the little IKEA kid spot (I don't know what they call it) for a couple of hours while you shop. (Mine are to big for this now but I most certainly have used this option in the past.) There is also a snack stand near check out and a little food store area with imports. I always get several bags of meatballs and gravy as well as multiple 6 packs of the AMAZING cinnamon buns that they have there!\n\nDon't pass up cinnamon rolls! You can buy just one if you want!"
26541,0,"The staff is not friendly at all. When u ask them to toast the sub or to add toppings, u can see from there faces that they are burdened. I understand that I go early when they open, but that doesn't give them the right to act like the way they do. The don't really say hi at all, instead I end up saying how Ur doing. If I had a choice to not to go to this branch, I would totally avoide this one."
432,1,"In my area, I have my choice of Time Warner, Windstream & DirectTV. I went with Time Warner many years ago because of the fabulous bundle pricing (basic cable DVR & high speed internet, only). Unfortunately, like almost everything else, they reward you so well as a new customer, but do not offer anything for loyalty.\n\nI've been with them almost 6 years & the first few years were fine.  I was happy with a below $100 bill every month & never had any outages.  Fast forward to the past couple of years & I've had outages out of the blue, significant rate increases, locked into two different year contracts, only to have my bill stand at a whopping $141 every month.  When calling to report outages / issues, I get the run around & a \""few days out\"" scheduled appointment.  As far as trying to get a better deal on my service...I'm always told, \""there aren't any promotions available to you right now\"".\n\nBuyer's remorse? You bet."
382,2,"BJ's has an impressive amount of, well, stuff. This big-box store has just about everything you need, and then some. Clothes, furniture, food, you name it. \n\nThere are only 2 of us, but we still manage to buy enough to more than pay for our annual membership. Some of our best savings come from the produce, deli meats (super cheap!!!) and the paper goods. The monthly coupon book they send (also available on-site) yields additional savings. You will also find deep discounts on clothes, vitamins, books and DVDs. \n\nWe rarely have to wait in line for more than a few minutes, and the self check out is very convenient. \n\nThis store is reasonably clean, albeit a little dingy.  (I've seen a lot worse in these stores), The employees have always seemed friendly. \n\n3 stars for not having fresh-made (on-site) items like its competitors (this is not a deterrent for me), and for always having a nagging salesperson when you walk in. No, really, I still don't want Direct TV. Thank you. The shopping carts could also use some serious maintenance."
23133,3,"I was first attracted by the sign - a huge longhorn skull.  Sitting at the end of a complex crammed full of chain restaurants I had to get closer just to see what kind of place would have such a cool sign.  Hey, look!  It's a bar!  A bar with cow-spotted seating!  Had to go in and grab a quick drink just for that.  The staff was friendly and they have Blue Moon on tap.  I will definitely go back the next time I find myself that far West..."
30400,1,"Such high hopes, but alas. The look and feel of the place are absolutely charming and bistro-authentic. Appetizers (tartar and dried meats) were adequate at best and fish entrees mixed (one served ice cold). Forty-five minutes between courses,for Pete's sake! Admittedly this was Saturday night, but it did not help to see the fellow who introduced himself as the general manager incessantly texting. Al fresco deck is lovely but the interior was super-hot, to the point that cooks could be overheard complaining. With time they may get this right but a ways to go before fulfilling very promising potential."
30310,4,the fish and chips was some of the best i have ever had and the drinks were pretty good. i recomend this over the actual resturaunt.
36634,1,"I have been on the search for a good nail salon for some time now and this is NOT the place.  I get gel manicures every two weeks like clock work and every two weeks I am going somewhere new. I don't like when they use Acetone to soak off the old gel polish, it it extremely bad for your nails, and I'm not even sure what the half cut lime rubbed on my nails was for.  Also I asked her to just cut them a tiny bit and she cut them almost all the way down.  Not going back and the search continues..........\n(4)"
18137,4,Everything you could need is here.  Yes you can venture out... But why would you?!
38274,3,This place is really small (5 tables total) and it's your typical little chinese restaurant with your typical food choices. I stopped in for lunch and got the orange chicken combo for around $5. I was actually impressed. It was good flavor and I'm completely full. The chicken was descent quality and cooked well. (Some little chinese place over cook the day lights out their food) You won't find many drink choices either. (6 total pepsi products)
1196,0,"By far the worst gay nightclub in phoenix and trust me I know gay nightclubs!!! \nLol no seriously this place is crap I have been suckered to come here a few times for a birthday party and some other events and it's no fun the drag show is lame or the acts I have seen are the Dj is good plays some different tunes the a/c is non existent I think they use a swamp cooler. The bathroom is the size of a toilet stall and always packed that u have to piss in the alley where there is plenty of hookers at your disposal. The drinks are expensive, watered down and even the soda tasted funny the bar tender was very nice and friendly. Never tried the food outside but I hear it's great, the parking is another disaster there is limited space and the night we went there was a few break ins in the back parking lot near liquor store. Just being honest but the bad outweighs the good at this club, give it a shot at your own risk but remember I warned you."
13329,4,"I've been to the original Bouchon in Yountville and enjoyed every minute of it. I loved the experience at the Las Vegas Bouchon just as much! We sat out on the terrace which was warm and beautiful with the calming noise of the fountain and pool behind us.  The menu was filled with an endless amount of food goodness. We started off with oysters on the half shell and the warm frisee salad with bacon and poached egg. I've attempted making this at home but will never be able to master Thomas Keller's savory bacon vinaigrette.  Although the steak frites would have been a sure winner, I decided to try something new I'd never had before - veal breast.  The veal breat was slow roasted and pulled from the bone, then formed into a flat piece and breaded on top and browned in the oven. What came out on my plate was a whole lotta goodness! The meat was tender, juicy and succulent paired with the wild mushroom ragu. Instead of polenta, I requested the frites. How could you dine at Bouchon and not have the frites. Although these ones were loaded with slightly too much salt, they were still one of the best fries I've ever had. Thin and crispy and absolutely addicting!  Also a delicious entree was the lamb loin - very tender. And the steak frites that are a classic of this restaurant featured a flavorful and thick piece of flatiron. \n\nIt was so much food so no room for dessert. Although they have the Bouchon Bakery downstairs so you can always save room for that later."
15244,0,"I was thoroughly unimpressed with this venue for many reasons....\n\n 1. it took 25 minutes to obtain a tasty beverage (beer) and about as long for glasses of water. (the restaurant was NOT even 25% full!)\n2. the waiter \""strolled\"" by with his Faux Hawk to take our order about 45 minutes later.\n3. when the food finally came a member of our party found something mysterious in her burger.\n4. we displayed mysterious item mentioned in #3 to said Faux Hawk and he appropriately took the plate away. however did not omit the vulgar item from the bill until we explicitly asked.\nbottom line, the grilled salad i had was good, but not good enough to warrant a second trip to Cook N Jacks or a recommendation to anyone."
49955,1,"I hate to be the odd man out but the previous revues must have been friends of the owner.  The Bolognese lacked flavor and the pasta was gummy and stuck together in a clump.  The Spiga salad advertised salami and pancetta\nAnd if there was one ounce of meat in it I could not find it.  My calamari was inedible and looked like it came from the frozen food case at Safeway. The dipping sauce with it was flavorless.\nOn the plus side the space is great with a good vibe.  If you go for vibe and space go, if you go for good food go somewhere else.  A generous 2 stars.\nAs usual North Scottsdale people confuse with flash with real quality cuisine. The I noticed that several great reviews that were the first ever in yelp, obviously planted by friends of the owner.  By the way the server agreed the calarmi  was terrible and removed it from my check"
6843,2,"It's a decent place but the food is hit or miss. I've had some great food as well as some really lousy stuff....once my wife sent her stuff back coz it seemed like it was a week old!\nOk to try sometime if u r in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't travel much for it."
28540,0,"F724 \n\nShe didn't even look at me, didn't bother asking why I was entering her place of business, didn't reply when I spoke and in no way acknowledged that I was even in her presence. Just handed me a ticket and was done with me. If this happened anywhere else, I would make an effort to never return, tell all my friends how horrible this experience was, and write a scathing review about the deplorable customer service of this business. Sadly, this was my Saturday morning at the DMV, a place I think is modeled after the agonizing depths of Hell. With the same musac score playing...and the same voracious stench in the air..and the same spastic children running around (only in my version of Hell, it's politicians campaigning around me). \n\nSo, I was already running late because I had to complete my emissions test early. Those nice people there not only told me there were only three DMVs open on Saturdays, they gave me a map. How precious. I was fortunate enough to be near one of the only DMVs open on Saturday (Seriously? Three DMVs open on Saturday for the entire Valley?) After receiving such a magnificent welcome, I knew this was quickly going to be among the most painful experiences of my life. To simplify what was so bad, let me make a list of what I feel constitutes acceptable behavior in public: \n\n1) Bathe. The combination of water and soap, along with massaging the skin, creates an outcome that is most pleasing. Be sure to scrub behind your ears and reference this website about another notorious spot : http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/htf/755891987.html \n\n2) Sit still. Yes, I know we're all waiting here for about an hour. But tapping your foot, rocking back and forth in your chair or bouncing your leg aren't going to make time go any faster. Trust me, I was watching the clock. If you feel anxious, get up and walk around. \n\n3) Leash your children. If they cannot sit quietly, leave them in the car. It's winter, they'll be fine. It's not cute when your little monster is running up and down the aisles with his honey bun squeezing out between his fingers. It's even more not cute when he fake-falls five times in a row right in front of me. \n\n4) Maintain quiet tones and ensure appropriate conversations when taking/making calls. To the lady behind me, I'm sorry you're not that experienced in stripping. The first thought that popped into my mind was you had a failed audition for Le Girl. Thanks to your continued conversation, I was able to figure out you were a woodworker. \n\n5) Acknowledge the humans around you. Yeah, I get it. I'm not that big. In fact, if I turn sideways I disappear. But, I'm still right in front of you so pay attention, quit bumping in to me and hitting my leg. Unless that was flirting, in which case you really need to find someone more your level. \n\nOh, the DMV: You have a brilliant recipe for dashing dreams and gutting humanity. And you manage to do it in a painfully lit room that reeks of a combination of my brother's old gym shoes and my dad's dirty underwear. There has to be an award for that, but I don't have the motivation to research it. \n\nOh, and F724 was my number upon entering. I spent and hour and 15 minutes looking at that slip of paper. Just so you know, that one star is for the website (which should probably get 3-4 stars but anchors like this oft sink the ship). \n \nLe sigh... \n\nOpen T-Sa 8:00am - 5:00pm; information only after 4:30pm"

I love that the hygiene is well maintained!!! \n\nShaina makes sure to get the job done as fast as possible.. and she is thorough... A little OCD never hurt anybody! I've tried a few places and she is by far the best!  Look at all the 5 star reviews.. Do yourself a favor and book an appointment ASAP!"
4104,2,"For the price, Hungry Howie's is all right. I like the choice of crust flavors, and the coupon deals are reasonable. The Howie's bread is super salty, but otherwise it's the way I like it--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I ordered a pineapple pizza, and there wasn't much cheese. Otherwise, it tasted good. \n\nI would say this is a step above Little Cesar's."
27402,1,"I visited this branch to get a new phone for a friend, and the staff were not as attentive as they could be. Yes, they did show us the handset me and my friend were looking for, gave us time to review it, but didn't keep an eye for being available again: in an empty shop all the staff chatting and literally I had to walk in front of them to get noticed. \n\nLater on when we decided to buy the headset, instead of thinking the customer's benefit and giving the PAYG card to the buyer with the \u00a310 credit (for a guest visiting from abroad, for example), instead the choice the representative used was to give the phone without the extra card since an existing O2 card would be used. Doesn't seem fair to me at all! \n\nAnd the switch from normal SIM card to a micro failed!!! And we had to do it again, but not on the same shop, of course."
31090,1,went on a sunday afternoon. only one lady working. she wasn't the friendliest of people. nor was the place very clean ...or at least it didn't look very clean to me. it was $10 for eyebrows and $5 extra for lip. (yes i got that mo going once in a while). \ncost--- not used to paying that much. back in so cal (spoiled little india) threading for brow and lips only $11. \nservice-- was quick however didn't get that ointment to soothe the sting from the threading. my eyebrows are nice but my male friends eyebrows come out a bit to fem.... im guessing she doesn't get many male clients. \ni dont think i'll be going back.... time too look again for a brow place. had hopes for this one.
34901,3,"Never would i have thought of doing this ...but my wife convinced me that it would be a decadent treat ...and a great bargain....and that it was. we enjoyed the 24 hour pass..starting with a late dinner at the paris..it was good, a huge line up till they closed it...and the next day we had lunch at planet hollywood..it was so good we had to go back for dinner...clean,  well managed, and freshly prepared.  i strongly recommend the buffet at PH. Its all about not pigging out....and not eating a taste of everything ..lol...hey its hard to get a salmon caesar  salad in vegas for less than 30 bucks..so $50. for 24 hours of  pretty much whatever  food you want is great...not something i would want to do often..but once in a blue moon why not?   enjoy"
28107,3,Great service and even better food. I had a ribeye that was one of the best I've ever had. My wife had the asparagus crab salad that she thought was good but nothing to write home about. The ambiance was five star (it's in the Encore) and the calamari appetizer was the best both of us had ever had. Mindblowingly good!! I'd give it five stars if my wife's dish was killer. \n\nI would go back in a minute.
44361,4,This has to be one of the best pizza joints in Las Vegas!! On our way to the concert we needed to get some food and as we walked by this spot we just had to stop. The smell of the pizza wouldn't let me walk any further. They make it just right and you watch them every step of the way! For how expensive it is to get a decent meal with good customer service on the strip this spot is a must do! The price is unbeatable and the taste will keep you coming back for more.
48185,1,"I really enjoyed the patio seating around this time of the year. Combination of Food and Drink menu kept me coming back, bringing visitors from out of town...until this time, I made a reservation via Opentable.com for out door patio. When I showed up, unfortunately there was a struggle with getting the patio table with the hostess. She stated that it couldn't be \""reserved\"" and she could only offer the inside. Interestingly, there were at least 3 other opens tables were opened in the patio as we finally were seated outside. Moreover, one of the table had a \""reserved\"" sign on it. It was really a confusing system. It was rather a frustrating experience! If this fox-concept place keeps this up, I can also help to spread the words...There are many other places can offer the same, patio, good food and drinks."
15744,4,Excellent food and excellent service.  The manager Kristen was awesome and so was our server Jeff. I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner.
6794,1,"I did not enjoy my shopping experience at this Office Depot.  I had some specific shipping supplies that I was looking for, and the employees seemed extremely unenthusiastic to help me find them.  After wandering around for a long time unsuccessfully looking for my items, I put what I had found back on the shelf and drove to Staples, where I found the same items for half the price and much friendlier service to boot."
24876,4,All the food is awesome and most of it is homemade... Definitely not freezer food. Bartenders are super friendly. Beer selection is always changing and always above average. Awesome happy hour deals. Overall good atmosphere. Highly recommend it for drinking AND eating.
13707,3,"To the handicapped person who cut to the front of the line while I waited 45 min to get to the beginning, took his time paying, and then MAGICALLY walked JUST FINE when he got to the food area and started zooming around, I DISAPPROVE!!\n\nBesides that, this is a solid buffet!\n\nGet in line at 3 pm, and you'll have a great chance at scoring the lunch price while they switch out for dinner foods at 4 pm. :) Save $15!\n\nThe hits were Prime Rib, Honey Smoked Bacon, Pork Loin, Shrimp Cocktail, Spanish Paella mussels...and pretty much all the desserts.\n\nThe lamb (super gamey) and the Kobe Top Sirloin (way too tough) did not sit well with me. \n\nI also do not get what the fuss is for the King Crab legs. They tasted icy.\n\nOverall a large variety of different cuisines. Just remember...don't fill up on the \""cheap\"" stuff ;)"
24245,0,"The last time I tried this place was in Lone Tree, CO about 10 years ago. I didn't think it was great there, and it wasn't great in Vegas, either. I'm not sure what all the hype is about, and I'm not sure how they've been voted best burger in 29 cities-- unless Vegas and Lone Tree were not included in that. \n\nThe service is SLOW. Granted it was a Friday night, but there seemed to be plenty of people working there and yet it was impossible to get a drink refill. I ordered a milk shake- definitely the hi-light of the meal- but it came so far ahead of the meal I was almost done with it and felt sick before food even reached me. \n\nThe food... I've had better at so many other places. I ordered a build-your-own chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce, cheese and bacon. The chicken was tough and over cooked, the bun cold and hard, not enough sauce and the skimpy 2 pieces of bacon were over done. I had about 3 bites before my jaw gave out. \n\nThe fries? Undercooked and cold. COLD. WTF? It's a busy Friday night and you bring me a basket of cold fries with my already sucky sandwich? Ugh. \n\nWe ordered the grilled cheese for the baby. I didn't think you could F that up, but apparently you can... by bringing it out without the cheese melted. WHAT? How can the bread be warm but the cheese still stiff? Needless to say he didn't eat it. What a waste. \n\nMy husband got a burger that was uneventful. He said he's had better, but did manage to finish it. He's the only one that actually ate. \n\nI would not recommend this place or go back. There are so many other better places in Vegas for a burger that wasting your money on this crap would be stupid."
46770,1,"I am sure this place has great food, and it has kind of a cool, young vibe. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu, so I asked the woman taking my order what sandwiches were the most popular. She recommended two, and I picked the one that sounded better to me. Some sort of club sandwich, not a far cry from a sandwich I would typically order, so I knew I would like this type of meal.\n\nWhen the food came, the sandwich was extremely disappointing. The bread was so DRY. Not fresh or springy or anything good, it was dry and crumbly. I took about three bites, discovered that the rest of the ingredients followed suit with being disappointing. \n\nSo, I brought it back up to the counter, and told the same woman who had taken my order that I did not like the food, that it was dry, and that I wanted to take it back. She was sweet and smart and called over another woman, Im guessing a supervisor or a manager, and explained the situation. This supervisor woman clarified that I \""just didn't like it\"" and told me that they would not be replacing my meal with something else. I said fine and just asked for a refund, which she unhappily gave me.\n\nThe thing that irks me is that they weren't willing to give me something else. So, I leave this place hungry and with a bad food experience. What incentive does this give me to go back? From the experience I had, I didn't like the food or the customer service. Not to mention, the sandwich alone cost 8 bucks. If I can go to Sprouts and get a bomb ass sandwich for $3.50, I want an 8 dollar sandwich to blow my socks off, not be a total disappointment."

21150,3,"Went to Cherry last night for the first time in over a year. Being a local for more than 3 years, Cherry truly reminds me of the now defunct Whiskey Bar at Green Valley Ranch. This is definitely a local spot. The music was rockin, and the drinks were strong. The dance floor is small, but we usually go outside and chill by the cabanas. It was a good mixed crowd. Saw \""the Glove\"" Gary Payton in the mix. Good place to mingle with the locals.\n\nGo on Fridays. There's no cover til 11pm and drinks are half off. And the line is short."

37947,0,"If you have been to other vegas clubs like Tryst, XS etc. and come to Marquee (like me) because you wanted to experience the newest vegas club I think you will leave disappointed. Even though we had a fun time everyone in our party independently came to the conclusion that we wouldn't come back here. \n\nI really don't understand the reviews that are raving about how beautiful the place is. Visually it has nothing on XS and even compared to Tryst or Surrender it hardly impresses (I realize I just named all Wynn/Encore properties, no I'm not affiliated with them, they just happen to have elegant clubs :))\n\nThe level of service we got at Marquee was way below what we would expect for the kind of money involved (2k minimum got us a terrible table, so we upped our minimum to get a decent table). My buddy described it as \""they're phoning it in\"" because it is so popular. I think that kind of describes it. Our hostess was absent most of the time and so I wasnt feeling generous and my patience was wearing thin when at the end of the night we had money left over and she insisted it couldn't be closed out without purchasing something. I explained that i understood what a minimum was and that was ok with me I just wanted to close out and get my ID and card back and obviously they keep the difference, we had only agreed to that minimum anyway to get the bigger table. What would be the point of us waiting for her to come open another bottle and bring a bunch of mixers when we were about to leave and what a waste anyway. Just take the money, how hard is that? We literally had a 20 minute argument about this. she even had the audacity to suggest I use the money to buy her a bottle of champagne to take home. Are you serious? I wasnt allowed to use the excess to buy the bottle for the table next to me but I could buy it for the hostess that was invisible half the night? Could hardly believe what she was saying. The whole thing made no sense and was just aggravating for no reason.\n\nMy friends and I have had excellent service in a variety of clubs in vegas, so what is Marquee's problem? Power to them that they are the 'it' club of the moment but they already lost our return business so good luck to them a year or two from now when the novelty fades. I don't expect them to have much staying power. \n\nTo offset my bitterness about this experience I'm going to go write a positive review about Lavo and the service we got there the previous night. Sure its a small club and not as fancy but we got treated like gold for spending 25% of what we spent at Marquee."

7497,1,"just got a Peter Piper Pizza for the 1st time in awhile.  I don't know what happened but the crust IS NOT the same.  TOO BAD.  won't ever go back again.  i grew up in the Valley and I have never had a PPP like this.  the cheese is different, the crust is different.  WHY WHY WHY??? the wings are SORRY."
4137,3,"They have great hours... open til 9 on the weekdays i believe, and I'm sure even later on the weekends. We were able to end our day with a drive out there, and made it just before close. They did have a diner where you could eat, but passed. Although it was very quaint, the reviews on food were mediocre. But, people were raving about the pies. They still had a great selection,tons of pies to choose from, even though it was the end of the day. We bought a whole pie, which are a little pricey, but well worth it, for the 2 of us to share. It did not last long! Plus a sticky bun, and another one piece of pie (which is nice when you cant choose) We were so disappointed at the thought of not being able to bring some home for our friends and family to try- so it will be a top recommendation to anyone we know going to visit the phoenix area. Although you could get them shipped, the shipping is astronomical, but at least will give us something to look forward to when on vacation in Arizona. The gift shop was also fun to look around in, lots of nicknack's and touristy souvenirs. Cant wait to visit again!"
278,4,My girlfriend is much newer to the area so I try to take her to real Pittsburgh places. Fiori's should be held right up there next to Primanti's as a staple. South Hills icon. \n\nThere's old world charm when you order. Pie comes out quick. It's awesome deliciousness scored me many points with the lady and satisfied my soul for making my not-often-enough trip to this fantastic pizza icon of the City of Champs. \n\nPreach.
198,0,"The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables, next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry, sloppy, soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow, inattentive, and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value, a nicer atmosphere, and quality food, I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay."
48163,4,I've been working out with tony for almost 2 years now. He has completely changed my life as far as fitness and nutrition. He makes custom meal plans complete with shopping guides to all the stores making it fast and efficient. He really understands his clients and cares about each one. The group training classes are so awesome! You work out with the same 4-5 people each week and over the years I've gotten to know a lot of really awesome people through team forty four. I take pride being a part of this team and love everything tony has done for me!
3526,3,"Terrible pizza. As a relatively new arizona transplant, I had been looking for a great local pizza joint. These guys charge restaurant prices for horrible rubbery SAMs club quality pizza. $30 for shit pizza. Don't waste your money."
525,3,"Great venue for a wedding - I attended a couple of weddings here and the chapel is very quaint.  If you like historic little places with lots of character and don't want to get married in an actual church, this is a great option. It is also centrally located between midtown & uptown districts, which is nice if you have people coming from out of town or simply from different sides of town. There is a beautiful garden outdoors with lots of trees and a sweet little gazebo which is perfect for those wedding photos."
28316,1,"Not the place it used to be.  They seem to be getting cheap.   No more Roma tomatoes on the subs, just that crunchy, unripe crap like Burger King.  The folks behind the counter are Spanish-speakers, I guess that's why the tv's were on a Mexican channel - but at least it had English subtitles."
47030,2,"The ice cream here is definitely tasted, but I think the ice cream is too melted. It has already melt down to my hand even before I went out of the front yard. I prefer something with more solid texture, but if you like soft ice cream, this is definite the place to go."
5072,0,"Blueberry Hill Family restaurant Decatur has gone WAYYYY down hill, the food quality is atrocious, the prices absolutely outrageous, and the specials are never available when you want one.  The last time we went it was at 6pm and they \""claimed\"" to be OUT of the special only an hour into their dinner service?  Methinks not.  Never again will we attempt to dine at this establishment."
27332,4,The food is amazing.\n\nThe service is wonderful.\n\nIf your lactose intolerant just add Parmesan and cut out the mozzarella.\n\nThank you for the food and wonderful service.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer and 4 pizzas. It fed 5 people very well.  Try the home grown peppers they are great.
20036,1,"Waited 10 minutes for menu and water. Didn't help it was 100 degrees outside.  Anytime the server was at our table, he never looked at us once. He was always looking around at passerby's. Took our wine list away before we even looked at it, then asked if we wanted drinks. I politely told him he took our drink menu away so we never had a chance to look at it. It was very obvious he would be very quick to get an attitude in any situation. Plus, it was Mother's day and it wasn't a very pleasant customer experience. But customer service is huge and they easily failed at that. The food was not very good. Caprese salad was just \""ok\"" and the calamari was HORRIBLE!!! Bland and overly chewy. No flavor. No one thanked us for dining or wished happy mothers day as we walked out. Not a very pleasant experience. We DEFINITELY won't be returning. Their name shouldn't be Luna Rossa.....it should be Luna Grossa."
13585,4,"I. Am. A. Fan. This place is so much fun! The friends I was with had all been to the Hofbrauhaus before, so I was the only one who didn't know what to expect. We made a reservation for 8:30 on a saturday and walked right in when we arrived.\n\nThe first thing you notice is the HIIIIIGH ceilings and how loud it is. If you are looking for a quiet place to eat, skip this place or sit in the room in the back which is much quieter, but you can still hear the music. Next time I go, I'd like to sit back there because it is made to look and feel like an outdoor garden seating area and it looked just lovely.\n\nBut this time we sat in the front room. The band played a mix of fun german singalong songs and american rock. They even played the  Star Spangled Banner and one point and everyone was singing. Very cool.\n\nThe prices were reasonable for a Vegas dinner. A friend and I split a sandwhich which was around $16 and the beer I had was $7.50. The more elaborate meals and larger beers are a bit more money, so plan on about a $30 meal.\n\nAnyplace that let's me stand on the chairs (bench) to see the stage is OK by me!"
16304,2,"After being told that there is no good BBQ in Las Vegas, I've been wanting any local (non-chain) place to prove them wrong.\n\nAlong comes TC's.  Their regular menu and breakfast menu elicits BBQ legitimacy, with Chicken, Ribs (spare ribs, baby backs & beef ribs), rib tips, and pull pork (any of these meats available in their omelets).\n\nThis being my first dining experience at TC's, I had to go with the three meat combo with 2 sides and cornbread in order to get a good feel of their BBQ.  My choices: Rib Tips, Baby Back Ribs, & Pulled Pork; Mac 'n' cheese & Fried Cabbage.\n\nTo my understanding, this is a family owned and run business and it showed from the extremely friendly and personable service to some of the family members playing a board game in the dining room because it was slow.\n\nThe rib tips were excellent as was the fried cabbage.  The pull pork was serviceable after adding a little more BBQ sauce.  The ribs however were dry and extremely charred.  TC's BBQ sauce is extremely sweet and lacking any kind of spice, but because that's not my cup of tea doesn't mean you won't like it.  The mac 'n' cheese was gritty and somewhat less than warm and the cornbread could definitely be categorized as stale.\n\nAll-in-all, I've rated TC's with three stars based on the service, \""BBQ restaurant\"" feel, and my craving to have more rib tips and fried cabbage.  As for rating a \""Rib Crib\"" for their Ribs, well that would be thumbs down."
20357,2,"REI has a few obvious challenges being in Las Vegas. \n\n#1 - Not a lot of need for raingear. \n#2 - Lots of sports only take place in spring, fall and winter. \n#3 - Vegas seems to be the main attraction for tourism, not the outdoors. \n\nIt makes sense they have a limited selection here. For an out of towner or someone from up north it may seem tiny. That being said, it's a great place to hunt for deals on warm weather gear!"
44711,2,"It was tough for me to go with a lower star rating, especially since I really want to see this place succeed, but I had to go to 3 stars from 4 simply because the service is spotty.\n\nI really enjoy the food. I find it decently authentic, especially since I'm spoiled by really good Thai food all over San Diego. \n\nThe thing is that the service isn't where it should be. It's still better than it was - the first time I visited, it took forever to get our appetizers and drinks - but something about how inconsistent the service was just bugged me. Took a while for water at some times, when it was quiet it felt like nobody was ready to take our order, things like that. \n\nI really like the pad thai here, though. My dad seemed to enjoy his sweet and sour pork, but I don't think he was blown away. I have previously ordered the pad si yew and that was pretty good as well.\n\nI also found the spiciness to be a little inconsistent. My dad ordered the same level of spiciness each time and they were a little far apart. Not sure what's up with that.\n\nI'm going to have to try some curries next time and see for myself how the spiciness scale is (I have ordered noodles and I don't typically order noodles to be very spicy). \n\nAlthough the prices seem fair from a San Diego perspective, I think they're a little high for Surprise. \n\nI hope these guys figure out their consistency and service issues because it would be a real shame for this place to be doing poorly, especially when there aren't a whole lot of options in Surprise for Thai."
20453,4,"I have searched the US for the perfect chile relleno, & I've been dissapointed many times over! Little did I know the most perfect chile relleno was just here in my home town, at Frank & Fina's Cocina! We tried their steak uxtal & chuletas... needless to say our plates were licked clean! Am very picky when it comes to mexican food, this is the only place I will go to! Prices are reasonable & definitely worth every bite! The staff & atmosphere is friendly, clean...u might even catch a glimpse of the Frank & Fina themselves humbly working in their beloved restaurant! If you are looking for a good authentic delicious mexican place, come here, u won't regret it!"
22728,1,"This used to be my favorite clothing store anywhere which I visited on every single trip to Vegas about twice a year. They used to carry Royal Underground, True Religion and Locman watches. However, on my most recent visit today, I found that all these brands were no longer carried and there were much less shelves and displays than before. WHAT HAPPENED???  \nI know that they had moved Royal Underground line to another store at the Encore, but to my surprise that store was totally gone!\nAnyway, I would have given this store 5 STAR rating a year or so ago, but their selection has gone down the drain. Please bring the good stuff back."
2191,3,"Quick, helpful, and clean  what else do you want?"
11977,1,"Good cooking techniques, creative presentation, but boring sauces that lack variety with fancy names, smokey flavour in the shrimp cakes will remind you of ball park hot dogs.  Exception was the shrimp tamale - quite tasty.  PS Bobby nothing personal but dancing on the cutting board didn't add any flavours to the food."
32067,4,"Julian Serrano, where have you been all my life? Recently had a ladies weekend in Vegas and a friend made reservations at this amazing restaurant in the Aria. We were all starving after a day at the spa and begged the waiter to bring plates out as they were ready. They were bringing plates out in what felt like seconds. And everything was amazing, but the highlights for me were the coca vegetarian, the stuffed piquillo peppers, and the churros. (Good number of items for vegetarians, by the way.) My mouth is watering now. Back to Vegas. Must go back to Vegas."
49342,1,"I have had their Veggie Hummus Wrap which is super fresh and super tasty one other time. Two days ago, I went for a return to visit to find several people waiting for their food and it wasn't until after I ordered, I noticed one worker doing ALL the work. Yes, flying solo, doing everything on her own. This girl was amazing, she did the register, the smoothies, and all the food on her own. By no fault of her own, it made wait times frustrating and long. I'm not sure why there would be one person working. Perhaps, a no show or sick call? Who knows. I do wonder how much one values his or her business when he or she doesn't provide adequate staff. I saw several people walk out and I'm not sure I want go for another return visit. Especially, if I'm in a time pinch. Two stars because their employees seem to work hard (when they're actually there) and the food was actually very good."
24674,0,Yuk.  No casino.  No view.  Small open shared pool. \n\nWhy would you want to go to Las Vegas and stay at a hotel like this?  \n\nLuckily the staff was nice enough to not charge us for bailing.
35703,1,The show was the standard onion volcano and spinning eggs. The food was nothing special as it went from bland to weirdly seasoned back to bland. \nAwesome wait staff helped the score but the price and overall food experience means I most likely return.
4811,2,"Decided to have dinner at Tofu Hut tonight. Overall experience was not bad, but I wouldn't call it great either. \n\nThey were a bit short staffed when we first walked in. I would say it took them over 5 mins to even acknowledge our presence even though they did see us walk in.  I expected a \""Hello, or Welcome\"" at the very least.\n\nWe passed on the AYCE tonight & went ala carte. We ordered short ribs & spicy chicken. Both orders were good, but nothing memorable or anything to rave about. I did love their banchan offerings! I liked the fish cake, japchae, spicy cucumber, and I don't recall the others but it was yummy!\n\nI would go back.. but don't think I'll be a regular at this place."
5553,2,Family friendly activities!\n\nIt was a flashback to my childhood skate parties.  The kids had a blast and the staff was pretty good at keeping track of the floor so the little ones didn't get run over.
1018,1,"Time has passed this place by. I used to crave stopping here every time I was back in town. This visit, after a 2 year + gap, I went back on a Friday night. Oops! It was 10:06 so they were closed - the parking lot was full and there was a line at the windows, but it was past closing, so NO CUSTARD FOR YOU!. On Saturday afternoon they were open, so I ordered a one scoop waffle cone... and that's what I got for $2+ - a small round ball of chocolate custard sunken way down in a large waffle cone. Since Culver's has opened up where I live, I now have a comparison, and Jarlings is no better on the basic flavors. When Culver's has a special flavor - say Black Forest Tort, there is no comparison. As I said, the time has passed them by and all they sell is (a bit pricey) nostalgia. A Shame."
6027,0,"I gave them 20% tips of my order, but they even forgot my order. I will never go back to have any meal in this restaurant. BTW, my friend told me that although this is a Chinese restaurant, this restaurant \""only\"" open for American people. Because if you are Chinese people, they will not treat you as well as American people. How pathetic this restaurant is !!!"
48330,4,Well appointed great service and amazing food. Make sure that you get garlic naan. Had the lunch buffet. The chicken makkani ( which I would compare to chicken tikki masala) melts in your mouth. The goat curry falls off the bone. Everything was Great!
7770,0,"I bought a new BMW f650gs twin two weeks ago (May 2012).  It was missing it's owner's manual so the sales person said he would order it \""overnight\"".  I came in two days later to pick it up from the parts department and after 10 minutes of waiting, could not get the parts guy to help me.  Later that day I received a phone call that the manual hadn't even come in and that it would be in on Thursday.  I show up Friday and there are 3 guys at the parts and service counter.  I asked one of them if I could pick up my owners manual, and he said only the parts guy could help me.  The parts guy knew I was waiting but insisted on talking about his days riding Ducati motorcycles on flattracks to somebody ... on and on and on.  Finally I walked out, not happy.  I called my sales guy and asked him to send me the manual.  IIt finally arrived after two weeks ... maybe I took \""invisibility\"" pills or something, because I had the exact same experience a year ago when I came in to check on some parts prices for my friend in Texas (no dealer at the time in his city).\n\nUpdate as of August, 2012.  After sending letters to the VP at BMW NA, I was finally about to resolve an outstanding issue - my BMW \""Ride Smart\"" reward.  It took almost 2.5 months of nagging BMW corporate to rectify a few simple issues with my very expensive motorcycle purchase.  I have read so many great things about this dealer on the internet (e.g. BMW forums) but did not receive even a basic level of customer service and attention to two issues:  a missing manual (finally got it) and a missing reward for purchasing a new BMW (finally got it).  Because of this treatment, I will never buy another BMW product.  \n\nAugust 2012 update:  I made a video showing the good, bad and ugly of this motorcycle.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6koHzbDCCNk&list=UUSZgIbvZItJr78kHY3Y9wnA&index=5&feature=plcp\n\nUpdate 01/2013.  I have had multiple issues with my brand new BMW and finally have given up on Victory for any form of proper resolution.  BMW NA doesn't care.  I am so frustrated with this bike, I continue to make the payments, but have permanently parked it at my house in Jerome until I can have the time to work on it myself and correct all of the defects (hard starting, mid range sputter, tires losing pressure, heated grips not working).  BMW is the worst product I have ever purchased.  I did just buy a new Suzuki Bandit - now that's a quality product with no defects!  Every time I drive by Victory I have bad memories of paying more than full retail and getting no service or followup - I feel they cheated me and I can only hope Karma will ultimately knock on their door.\n\nUpdate 06/2013 - I have been using Go AZ for BMW issues I cannot resolve - they are an awesome dealer.  I will never step foot in the Victory dealership again."

43303,1,"Vegan Mexican with a urban funk to it. Should it work?  I dont know. Did it work?  Not really.\n\nWe walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there.\n\nThe menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order.\n\nWe ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark. \n\nOur tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.\n\nThe tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good.  However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $21 and 45 min we were less than happy.\n\nThe next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is.   \n\nSo I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot. Otherwise there are many kinks that need to be worked out."

17379,1,"This is a mixed review for me because I love the ambiance of Mucho Gusto, the staff is really nice, and the orange jalapeno margarita is amazing.\n\nThe food however, I was not all that impressed with. We ordered the skewers - mushroom, pork and chicken and we were not blown away with any of it. Maybe I will go back and try their tacos, but I am thinking I will keep it as a good place to sit on the patio, eat chips & salsa and drink a good margarita or two. I am not into \""modern\"" Mexican food (whatever that means) - I like authentic Mexican food!"
26648,2,"This place was fairly good, I have eaten there a few times and have learned the pork tacos are the best!!!! I have also had the fish not a big fan, loved the hot sauce was good. While the food is ok, with a great price this is not what I envisions a taco. But the idea of eating organic is great. This is not your regular taco joint."
26230,4,"Yum, yum, yum! \n\nWhen I am in Vegas there are a few things I look for in a restaurant. First and foremost I want the food to be fabulous, check! I want the atmosphere to be alive. I didn't come to Vegas to order room service or go to some quiet empty place. And I want good service. \n\nLavo passed all my 'Vegas requirements' with flying colors. When you arrive you are brought warm garlic bread and marinara sauce. It's the perfect start to the meal and it's hard not to eat all of it.  \n\nFor starters we shared what seemed to me to be the worlds largest meatball. It was fantastic - moist, and flavorful. Also covered in that tart and sweet marinara sauce.  We also had the beet salad. A healthy choice still packed with tastiness. \n\nFor entrees we had the chicken, the pasta and a steak. Everything was delicious!"
37473,3,"The reviews here on Yelp are spot on. The location is a bit further from me than the other places I had tried - but the reviews here pushed me to try it.\n\n$52 (yelp special) for 90 minutes!  How can I say no?\n\nsure.  its not a \""luxury\"" spa with typical feminine fluff.  It is however clean, comfortable, inexpensive and quiet.  I do not need anything more.\n\nI was put in a partitioned \""private\"" room.  Told my masseuse what I wanted her to work on (more feet and calves - no face and scalp).  The rest was history.  I fell asleep :)  My masseuse was strong, giving me the muscle therapy I needed.  perfect amount of pressure.  Surprisingly, she was also exactly on target with the 90 mins.  I was not shorted like I have experienced elsewhere.\n\nMy only complaint (as someone else mentioned) was she woke me up because she started talking on her cellphone during my massage.  She was trying to do it at a whisper, but was still intrusive and unappreciated.\n\nMake sure you mention the Yelp discount for 10% off.  After my  visit I was given a VIP card for 10% off anytime.\n\nI will definitely be going back.  this is my new go-to spot for foot therapy.  Plus, Lee's liquor is right next door :)  kills two birds with one stone!"
21484,2,"I sooo want to love this place. Really, I do.\n\nThey do many things right... Verging on awesome:\n\nGreat new digs,\nGourmet beans,\nSingle cup pour over,\nConvenient location (at least for me).\n\nBUT, and it's almost beyond my comprehension why this is the case, they don't offer half-and-half!!??\n\nI'm my own version of a coffee snob... But I like cream in my coffee.  \nYes, they have 2% Milk... If you ASK.  After a short coffee snob lecture about how their coffee tastes best without milk, they'll pull it out of the fridge.  \n\nHow hard would it be to also have cream in the fridge?\n\nSo if you like your Jo straight up, no add ons, this is a really nice coffee shop. But if you're a coffee heathen - as I apparently am - you'll want to find another coffee shop that serves half-and-half with the cup - meaning - pretty much any other coffee shop in the world."
3146,1,"Overall I just wasn't super impressed with this place.  I heard good things about it, so I decided to brave the very long wait...which is always present and eat breakfast here.  The food was decent, don't get me wrong, but there was nothing that truly stood out to me and it's quite crowded.   Sorry, but I would rather go to the Gilbert House down the street any day."
32707,2,"3.5 stars \n\nCulinary Dropout is similar to me in that it has an Identity Crisis. It is located in a Mall, has hipster servers, luxe/goth furnishing, sports playing on TV and pop music. So what are you? \n\nWas excited to try this place because I had heard so many good things, but the food ended up being only okay. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and an Arnold Palmer. \n\nMaybe I'm being a little snobby, but it is still hard for me to get over that it is located in a mall. \n\nMy other half got the paper bag beer which is $2 and was probably the best part. He was positive it was a Mexican beer, but it was from the good old Wisconsin (Hamms), so much for his Mexican roots. I guess they do this with shots too for $6. \n\nI do want to come back to try some of the drinks. They have a large drink menu and they all looked super yummy. \n\nIf you are daring try Yesterday's Soup. I'm sure it is still fresh. :)"
19017,0,"The meat here tastes nasty-so nasty I had to send it back.  I tried a curry chicken dish and the beef with eggplant.  The curry was good if it was without the chicken. When I sent it back the lady got so mad and started yelling in her language =/  I felt so weird.  What horrible customer service!  And then she said to me, \""that is the last eggplant today-NO MORE.\"" I was like oooookaaayyy whatever that meant lol  I would never ever come back.  The restaurant looks dirty and there is no health grade rating posted anywhere (and we all know why).  I wonder what they are trying to hide.  Anyways, do yourself a favor and go to Thai Chili."

23012,2,"I'm not a fan of sweets. However, I wanted to give The Cupcakery a try. While I don't like cupcakes, I do like carrot cake. So we decided to split a Bugsy, carrot cake with cream cheese topping. It was pretty decent as far as cupcakes go. It was a little too sweet for me and I let my wife eat most of it. As we were leaving I saw they had miniature cupcakes. If we go back, I'll probably get one of them as that's about all the sweet I can handle. They do have a nice variety, and I wouldn't mind trying some more. The minis should serve me well for that."
46954,2,"This place is pretty fun! The staff can get a little forgetful and zone out a little, but they are pretty upbeat. Why not 4 stars, it's a bit pricey for a burger/bar joint. I unfortunately didn't order a burger, I just ordered mozzarella sticks to munch on, while my friend ordered a full meal. The mozzarella sticks were pretty decent, I usually say motsy sticks can be determined by the marinara sauce, if you have good marinara you have good motzy sticks. Their sauce was pretty decent for a burger place, not bad at all! I have to say I wish I did get a burger, for my friend ordered their BBQ/Bacon burger and it was pretty delicious! Im not a fan of BBQ, but this burger wasn't overpowered with the BBQ sauce. The BBQ taste was a good flavor that added to the burger, bacon and cheese! Gave it a nice little kick! Food was good, staff was decent, stays pretty busy on the weekends and the prices are a little high, but you have to kind of expect that for they are right there in Old Town Scottsdale. Old Town seems to have little higher prices then other restaurants down the streets. Overall A-OK place!"
23980,3,"My favorite dish here is the tuna pizza. It was recommended as the most popular dish here and they did not disappoint. I already am a fan of truffle oil, so I knew this dish had to be good. The kobe beef tataki just bursted with flavor in your mouth. I also tried the sushi with the pop rocks which the name in itself already caught my attention. I think it's a cool concept but I personally did not like the sweetness from the pop rocks mixed with the sushi. I do appreciate the chef's creativeness in this. Overall, very good experience here, not to mention the beautiful backdrop of the Bellagio water show in the background at night."
36426,4,The grilled pineapple is a delicious addition to the adobada taco!

21999,3,"Best Reuben I've had for such a great price. It's flavorful and delicious. I would go back for the sandwich alone. The service however was complete sh*t. The guy at the register was an absolute A-hole and it took everything in me not to climb over the counter and choke him. But like I said... The sandwiches are worth it. \nMy gf had the ham, egg, cheese breakfast sandwich and she said it was one of the best she ever had as well. We may go back."

6147,0,"Time for an update.  I will say we had no problems with this company when renting, paying our rent, and living peacefully with no contact as we had no problems with the rental property.  However, this company is very shady.\n\nWe knew our lease was expiring at the end of April, and had a feeling they would go up on rent as they always do each year.  Luckily we were smart and decided to look for a new place early on in the event the rent did go up.  \n\nThis is where the shady part comes in.  You have to give Talley a 30 day notice (March 31 for us) your intention of how you would like to continue your lease by either extending another year (at a higher rate) or extending month to month (yet an even higher rate).  Or you have to give Talley a 45 day notice if you intend to vacate (March 16 for us (a weekend date which they are not open)).  They did not send us the letter of their intention on how or if they were going to increase the rate until the week of March 10, so we actually did not receive it in the mail until Wednesday, March 12.  So if you wanted to move out, whether you could afford the new rate or just did not want to pay their new rate (later for us), you had 2 days to make a decision.  Like I said, since it is their thing to increase rent each time, we were ahead of the ball and knew if they increased, we would leave.  If they expect renters to give them proper notice, they should be a good company and give us proper notice to make our decision.\n\nWe left and now the property is listed for rent at the price we were paying (so they couldn't give us that price as good tenants, instead they would rather let it sit and wait to be rented), they could have had us for another year, plus.  The only positive I can say from this is that we moved out and received our deposit back in a timely manner.  \n\nOut of all the rental properties and companies I have dealt with, Talley is my least favorite and I would steer clear from them."
31951,1,"Went there after the club waiting to get my hands on some wings...after waiting for a table for 30 minutes, we sat down only to find out that they DISCONTINUED THE DAMN 25cent WINGS!!!!  It's $7.99 now for 10 wings and fries, BS.....anyways, it is cheap food price and quality wise.  You get what you pay for.  Waiter messed up the order, but whatever.\n\nAnd if you want wings tossed in butter, get mild...:/"
33012,2,"The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one."

38553,1,"This place got really good reviews so we decided to give it a try.  I don't know if we just ordered the wrong stuff or the sushi chef was having a bad day or what but I really didn't think their rolls were all that good.  We ordered a few rolls from their happy hour menu: Philadelphia, crunch, California and some sort of shrimp/avocado roll.  The rice was dry and had no flavor!  I think they forgot the vinegar!  \n\nWe also ordered the following:\n\nEdamame: I've never seen so many of the beans out of its pod!  It tasted about par with other places though.\n\nGyoza: I always thought they were different (but similar) to Chinese dumplings but here, it was EXACTLY like a Chinese dumpling.  Tasted OK.\n\nVeggie fried rice: They used really sticky (I'm assuming sushi) rice to make it.  I wouldn't mind it so much if I wanted sticky rice but we ordered fried rice ... usually the rice is a lot looser.\n\nMiso soup: really bland and I am one who usually prefers bland food.\n\nSeaweed salad: By far my favorite.  At other places it's usually a huge salad entr\u00e9e so it was nice they had a small side of it I could order.  Great flavor.  Perfection.\n\nI would at least give this place a try again.  I just can't imagine this place getting such good reviews but the sushi tasting the way it did.  I can only assume it was an off day.  The service was good though and they have booth seats which is always a plus when you  have a toddler!\n\nOn the (far) West side, my barometer for good sushi is usually comparing the new place I try to Tomo's off of Dysart/McDowell, the Japanese food restaurant we frequent most."
46271,3,"Delicious!  Fresh baked goodies everyday!  Menu concept reminds me of Hash House A go-go but healthier!  Also, you pay cashier and pick up your drinks, then find a table.  Kind of weird service set up.  But food is worth the wait!  Can't wait to go back for lunch salads, i'll be back for sure!"
22894,3,"I really like the Springs Preserve.  This review would have been 5 stars if the Preserve still had the \""Untold Stories\"" series on the first Thursday of the month.  These programs about the history of Las Vegas were wonderful, but the Preserve decided to re-evaluate their educational offerings.\n\nI love the Origen Building with its movie \""Miracle in the Mojave\"" about water and the lack thereof in the Las Vegas Valley.  It's a brief film, narrated by Martin Sheen, and it quite nicely relates how the area came to be what it is geologically.\n\nThe flash flood in the Origen is also fun to see.  When it's not too hot, I like to go in the back and see the animals in the fenced area or in the display domes.\n\nI need to go back and hike the trails again to see what has changed from when they opened."
16701,1,"I've tried this place twice now.  The first time, I really loved their calamari appetizer.  The rest of the dinner a seafood pasta was just okay.  The second time, I ordered a chicken breast with asparagus in a cream sauce (alfredo) with a side of  Italian wedding soup.  The cream sauce was so bland that I had to dress it up with condiments on the table.  The soup was a big disappointment as well no flavor and too much orzo and not enough broth.  My husband had the lasagna and found it cheesy with very little meat.  With all the great reviews, I was willing to give it another try, but the price is not enough for me to try it a third."
8791,4,"Top's is amazing.  I love going there.  Their beer selection is fantastic and the customer service is awesome.  You don't feel like you're at a store.

I didn't buy any.  The way I see it, Top's, if you're gonna have a salesman in your place, that was the guy to have.  I was pleasantly weirded out.\n\nI vouch for Top's.

16953,3,"We organized a bachlorette party here and we had two major issues.  One the pre-fix menu and two the caviar bar seating.  Although most of my friends are rail thin, they can eat.  The menu included a taste of caviar, a garden salad and a petite filet.  The dessert was an ice cream cone.  Well, since the filet was more petite than we imagined, most of us were hungry...  We all laughed and said that we should of ordered the bachelor party menu (heh heh).  \n\nThe other thing we had issue with was the bar seating.  I was sitting at one end and the bride to be was sitting at the other.  I don't think we shared one word the entire dinner.   In hind sight, we would have just made reservations for seven and had whatever we wanted... \n\nI would have ranked this a three, but the trendy atmosphere and the free admission to rain was worth the extra star."

So still why the terrible review...its courtesy especially when eating with people you havent seen in quite some time to wait for all the food to arrive at the table to begin chowing...2 of our parties food took 30 minutes later than everyone else's to come out. appetizers came in too fast which were fantastic (sweet potato fries) huge gap in between that and the entree. the waitress kept telling us the kitchen was behind and that the burger was being made. 10 minutes later she told us that they forgot the order. finally after 30 minutes the burger comes out. i dont care how many orders you have, the next burger should have been ours but no...we watched tables come in and sit down and get their food faster.\n\nwhen coming to visit vegas, my friend told me this place was great and he wanted to try it. sadly i was a little disappointed not by the food. but its not always bad food that ruins the experience."
10932,3,Been to Yama twice and both times were awesome! My husband and I ordered the all you can eat sushi. The sushi were quite delicious and they also had a variety. Will definitely recommend.\n\nMy only complaint is that the price for the children's all you can eat was the same as the adults.
4611,0,"just ate here tonight. this place sucked big time. everything was so soggy! first off the diet coke was flat and too much syrup. my friend ordered the caterpillar roll and the rice was so soggy. i ordered the cali roll and yuck....too much rice vinegar & crappy fake crab meat....the tempura i could not believe they served me what they did.... the tempura was not crispy at all, it was mushy, almost like it wasn't cooked all the way! the oyako donburi was aight but too much rice and not enough chicken! this place is outrageously over rated! will not go back. Brians Beach is da bes if you want fresh ass sushi!"
32549,2,"Went here for an office event about a month ago.  Service was really great, food was pretty good and ambiance was fine for this type of group event. We initially sat at the communal table on the second floor but ended up migrating to the area under the stairs as it allowed us to network. \n\nThe servers were very flexible and kept the drinks flowing. The food was great - simple pub fare but overall well done. Loved the eggplant option, hummus, calamari, wings, and other dishes to share."
17263,2,"If you've had real British food, then you'd probably think this place is on par with your previous experiences.  \n\nI think the concept is cool.\n\nThe food is OK but somewhat uninspiring...but then again this is British food (not a knock, just the truth).  I tried the Turkey pasty and Salmon pasty.  As for taste, I definitely give the edge to the salmon.  \n\nFor dessert, I tried the Strawberry Palova.  It was good, but very rich so I could only a eat half of it.\n\nThe best thing about this place is that its very affordable for those who eat on a budget.  We had two pasties, dessert, 3 glasses of wine and a Sprite for less than $50.\n\nIf you've never been, I definitely recommend checking out this place."

2095,4,"Man, this place is just good.  I don't know if it's a European, American or Polish deli, but the sandwiches are damn good.  Hell it could be called Best of Antarctica Meats & Deli and they would still have some of the best sandwiches in town.  When you buy a sandwich, you actually get two, so keep that in mind.  The sourdough bread is amazing.  The cold cuts are very high quality and delicious.  I purchased a few Polish sausages to go and made them at home later.  Wow.  Impressed."
9653,1,"Good bingo and 5$ blackjack that pays 3:2. It's amazing how 1 person can totally change your view of a place.  After playing a few bingo sessions and blackjack, I finally decided to get a drink. So being broke, I sat at a penny slot and waited for the waitress to come- 15 minutes of wait time. I asked for a beverage and she said that I needed to be consistently betting at least 20 cents a bet because that's their rule. I was nice enough to tip her even though she was rude to me and I couldn't even drink their shitty sweet no-alcohol daquiri. Time for a new bingo place :)"
40495,3,"If the main casino isn't quiet enough for you (though that's unlikey!), head upstairs to this sports bar. There is gaming at the bar and a nice selection of draft beer. There are also tables for easy viewing of the many TVs. You must try the $1 cheese pizza slices, which are only available when the kitchen is open (weekends only unless during game season I think). The pizza is great!"

17519,3,"Came here for restaurant week and I very much dug the decor. Especially the wall of bottled spirits. That was kinda kickass and the only thing it was missing was one of those rolling library ladders.\n\nThe food itself was alright but nothing mind-blowingly spectacular. For appetizers, we had the chips and spinach artichoke dip which was extremely cheesy and creamy but not overpoweringly so. An excellent appetizer, I must say.\n\nNext was the entree. I ordered the blackened mahi. It was topped with crab meat and tomato creole. Didn't really taste much of the creole sauce but the crab meat was pretty good. The mahi itself was kinda bland and didn't have much flavor. A friend ordered the citrus-glazed soy salmon or something and I had a bite of that and it was pretty good! But on the side, the honey-roasted carrots were super awesome. They were soft, gooey but not mashed gooey, sweet, and just very flavorfull.\n\nAnd finally dessert, the white chocolate brownie was quite good. Complex in its design and presentation but simple in its taste. But sometimes, simplicity tastes excellent! What we have is essentially a brownie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and ribbon-like shavings of white chocolate. Can't go wrong with that, yeah?\n\nSo in the end, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars. The food, while good, wasn't spectacular and my mahi was kinda bland. But the dessert and the decor made up for it and it's a neat little place to take a lady out on a date to. Yay!"
49618,4,"This is the best place in the east valley to find vintage and antique items. With over 140 occupied booths, you'll find nice variety here. There are \""man\"" themed booths, Victorian frills and lace, western flavored booths and lots of cool vintage kitchen ware. All kinds of win here!"
2858,3,"First and foremost, always use a coupon. If you live in Chandler they should come in the mail every other week. This will save you at least $12. Everyone here is friendly. The food has never disappointed and I've been here about 100 times. There are many good selection. The shredded beef taco is big and juicy. It tastes amazing. The burritos are decent but are a little bland. The Chimichanga is good, but is it worth the extra calories for being deep fried? That all depends on your metabolism. My new favorite choice here is the Mexican pizza. It is huge and filling. There are so many different flavors going on. The chips and salsa here are my favorite(tied with Serrano's that is). There is also a nice patio outside on a pond with a water fountain in the water that lights up at night. It looks pretty cool."
32841,2,"We came here for breakfast.  We checked in and waited.  And waited and waited.  The lines were very long.  We finally got a seat and were very excited to sit down and enjoy a fabulous breakfast.  \n\nFood was just ok.  We got the fried chicken/mashed potatoes/egg combo (forgot what it was called) and a Chorizo skillet.  The skillet was far better than the other dish and this surprised me.  The order on the eggs was wrong (brought scrambled-- ordered over medium) and we waited almost until the end of our meal for this to be corrected.  We also had bloody marys and they were also just ok. \n\nThis place is fun; presentation of food is unique and I think it is better than most places for breakfast, but I think Vegas is full of overrated places like these."
45282,2,"The Good:\nI really love the flavor of the food in this place. My wife and I would order from them all the time.  We would always get the pad see ew, which is amazing! The crunchy pork with the chinese broccoli is also a favorite of ours.  It's also conveniently close to our apartment and my work.  So if we're craving some Thai food, I just order and pick up.  \n\nHere's a tip, if you live in the vicinity, I suggest you just pick up, unless you're literally just around the corner.  If you order through their website or from eat24.com, even if you live less than 2 miles, they will still charge you $7 for delivery, since for some reason, there's some sort of glitch in the system and if you don't speak Thai, then explaining is not really an option. \n\nDislikes:\nI would say that there are just a few things I dislike about Chao Thai.  First is that for the price of their a la carte 6.95 and up, the quantity is not that much.  So if you're planning to feed more than 2-3 people on a couple of dishes, you may want to order extra.  Also, we went there tonight and ordered the Mongolian beef. Now, my wife and I LOVE Mongolian Beef and we order it at almost every Chinese restaurant we go to.  It's pretty much how we measure the quality of most Asian establishments that serves the dish (I know, WEIRD).  So we ordered the Mongolian beef and when we got the dish, there was literally, about 15 small pieces of beef and the rest was onions..............awwwkward.  So I asked the waiter and he said that's how it is.  WTF!? Seriously? I wanted to complain, but my wife was tired and told me to just let it go.  She was more upset about it because it's one of her favorites.  The flavor was really great, but the portion of the meat in the dish was HIGHLY disproportionate.  They should have called the dish ONION with a side of Beef............ RUDE! \n\nLastly, we ordered from Chao Thai at my office not too long ago and one of my colleagues ordered the Pepper Steak lunch special.  Now, I'm not EINSTEIN or anything, but correct me if I'm wrong, when you hear STEAK, you know it's BEEF right?? Well, I called and asked why it's an extra $1.00 for the beef option?  And yes, when you order online, they ask you if you want chicken, pork, tofu or beef for an extra $1.  Here's my problem with this.  First of all, the dish is PEPPER S-T-E-A-K.  Meaning.......beef is already implied in the dish.  So why not just charge $1 more......  no, they actually give you an option and charge you a $1 more for what the dish is SUPPOSED to come with.  It's not a big deal, but when I called and inquired, the lady I spoke to said, \""beef cost more, that's why it's a dollar extra.\""  Uhm, I didn't ask for an economic lecture, Lady! She also said, \""Nobody has ever complained before.\"" Again.......... WTF? Maybe no one has ever ordered online and got the $1 extra option!! I didn't want our food to be spat on so I just said, fine, just deliver it! \n\nI would give them an extra star if they stop being so DAMN CHEAP about they meat!!!!! Damn!!!!! \n\nTHE END."

28322,0,"If I was able to put zero stars I would have. I am very upset with this establishment! I dropped off a dress and when I went to pick it up the straps were missing. I had worn the dress one time and spent $150 on it and it can't be worn without the straps. I noticed right away that the straps were missing and asked the clerk if she could check for them- she called the place that the clothes are sent out to and they told her they would try to look for it today. I didn't hear anything back, so I followed up about 5 hours later and the girl again asked what color the straps even were and said that she would call again. Still no call back on Monday- so I followed up and they said sorry we can't find them. I asked for a supervisor's number and they wouldn't give it out, she said she was only allowed to give out a email address. I demanded that she contact the manager and give him my number to follow up. I also emailed the manager, Mark the entire story- still have not heard back. I plan on telling everyone I know not to go to this flithy dump! I understand that things happen and things get lost, but I expect better customer service and the manager to get back to me to rectify the situation."

13675,1,Tasted worst than a college dorm cafeteria. UC Davis has a better eating experience than this buffet. Limited selection and undercooked meat.
41756,1,"Food. Order the 4 choice of meat ( brisket, rib, sausage, pork ), fried pickle, Mac and cheese, green beans. \n\nFood was better than the last BBQ place I had gone to, but hey I'm from Texas I know what real BBQ taste like. The brisket was good, everything else was meh. Mac and cheese was not great, fried pickle was good. \n\nService was horrible, i didn't get to put in my drink order, she left to get the first order of drink rather than waiting for 3 people to put in a request. When we were done eating our food we were waiting to get our server attention to get a to go box. But what was funny how we asked a server who wasn't our server,didn't want to get it for us.  He pointed where our server was, who happen to see she should attend our services. Not only that but our server was so stupid that when we asked for the check she said can I get you another beer. Had you checked on us earlier maybe, but not when we asked for the check. Duh, common sense.\n\nServers eat in front of the customers, they mingle and drink in front of our faces and you see the hostess flirting with the bar backs. Had I known this was a mingle for people who hated their jobs and wanted to hang out, I would have gotten my food to go and and not see a social place where people just want to sleep with each other after work. \n\nP.s we were the only table they were serving!"
35149,3,"The beau and I stopped by on a whim whilest exploring our new city and it's probably the best find so far. \n\nWalking in for a late dinner we were happily greeted and easily seated. Service was prompt and pleasant. We ordered some garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and chicken vidaloo. All came out within 10 minutes and boy was it amazing! The tikka masala was creamy and fresh. My beau ordered his vidaloo spicy, and it was the perfect amount of spicy.  We've been back at least 8x since and always end up happily full. (ITIS!)\n\nI can't wait to try the lunch buffet!"

18525,0,This place is a joke.   I Call them they tell me they have a special two pizzas14.99 and I order it. They bring it and delivery guy says  29.99.  I tell delivery guy about their  price quote  and he calls his boss.. Boss says their price is correct.  I talk to owner she argues and tells me that the price is 29.99..i mean I'm not lying lol... I felt bad for driver but told him to take pizzas and leave.   Also they said 45 minutes and it took 1 hr 15 minutes.. This place is literally a joke of an establishment

31346,3,"Not the best, but better than most.\n\nOk, to be honest, the first time I came here, it wasn't really by choice.  I was actually headed to the place next door (if you've been here, you know what restaurant I'm talking about) but my reservation was \""denied.\""  So, being hungry and unwilling to wait 2 hours to be seated, the wife and I reluctantly walked over to Seoul Oak.  We were one of two tables seated.  At 7pm.  On a Friday.  I had second thoughts, but...\n\nThe waitress was so polite and helpful, we decided to give it a shot.  And we were impressed.  We ordered off the all you can eat menu and then proceeded to stuff ourselves silly.  The side dishes seemed never-ending!  The big bone kalbi is a must, though the meat could be served thicker.  My favorite is the spicy pork, which has slightly sweet notes as you start eating, but the heat builds and next thing you know you had two bowls of rice.  \n\nThe food was delicious and relatively authentic (compared to the \""Americanized\"" or more trendy eateries).  We even took a kid from Korea (on a later visit) who said the food was like how his mom makes.  Seriously.  But on a recent visit (maybe two or three weeks ago) we noticed that some of the menu items tasted differently.  Maybe a new cook?  Maybe they just changed the recipes?  It wasn't bad, but a surprise.  \n\nThe place is very unassuming, and I'm not sure if they even have a sign (in English...if you're going West to East on Spring Mtn., I know there is a sign in English).  But come here for straight up Korean food that is filling and tasty."
6681,1,"Small, crowded, dark, dirty utensils, glasses, mugs, fly-ridden during the summer, stuffy and stale during the winter (8 months people.  8 MONTHS!)  Espresso Royale sucks.  You can't study in here.  Music is too loud, and too many kids keep bumping into your table.   And if you can't study in a cafe, what are you doing there?  Oh, you live on campus and you don't have a car and you meet up with friends close to where you live?  Right.  Not my situation.  So, go figure.  \n\nAnyhow, I hope my next review will be less bitter."
31838,2,"I had heard about this place for soooooo long, and I was in the area and figured I'd stop in before I went in to work. It's tucked in to a nice shopping center and I walked in and was a little surprised at how big it was. There's a lot of seating and the inside was nice and clean. I knew that I wanted a navajo taco but I wasn't aware that there were so many options! I had the ground beef taco (can't remember specifics), waited for a few minutes, and was on my way. \n\nFirst of all, it was HUGE. I had no idea it would be so big, but it was definitely worth $7 I spent on it. It was very filling, that's for sure. I had half of it, the ingredients were fresh, the beef wasn't spectacularly seasoned but it was good nonetheless. I'm not sure if I'd return for a meal, but I definitely want to go back for dessert....mmMMmm"
45762,2,"Not really on the strip, that's too bad because it's pretty nice.\n\nI would say it's less classy/luxurious but very urban, rocker like. My friend told me about this great steak and eggs cafe they have for only $7.77, gotta check it out next time."
23410,0,"I enjoy falafels and my boyfriend really likes Gyros.  So, when we received a coupon for Daphne's Greek Caf\u00e9 we were jazzed to go check it out.\n\nWhat I noticed right away is it has kind of a fast-food sort of feel to it and I thought, OK, its catering to people on their lunch breaks.  However, the food itself is like Greek fast food for people who have never had anywhere near really Greek food before and so they wouldn't know any better.\n\nThe plates are astatically pleasing with everything arranged nice and neat.  This amounted to zilch to me.  When I got to eat, I want plenty of food and I want quality as appropriately expected from the type of establishment I am eating at.  \n\nAt Daphne's you get a few little thin slices of what may or may not be real gyro meat.  The falafel meat is little over fried disks.  That's right disks.  Not balls of falafel meat where the outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is meaty and moist.  The pita bread is not.  It's just some flat bread cut into little triangles.  The tzatziki sauce is ... what the heck is this stuff in this little 1 inch paper cup?  The vegetables were fresh.\n\nThere is more to complain about with this place, but you get the picture.  I'm thinking that anyone who likes it here just doesn't know what real Greek food is like."

715,1,"I went here with a couple of friends a while ago and honestly everything was mediocre at best. For the price, quality, and quantity there's a similar restaurant nearby that's way better.

39306,1,"Mediocre Chinese food. The quality of food was not so good. The service was even worse. The bill was not calculated correctly. And the waiter was not there when we need him. Perhaps that was because of a busy Friday...\n\nOverall, I would like to recommend other Chinese restaurant on Murray, such as Rose Tea or Ka Mei."
15828,0,"Disappointment comes in small portions: I understand what they are trying to achieve. I understand they would like me to order 5-6 items, but I have no desire to spend anything over $50 for lunch. The sangria was the only morsel of hope for me to ever return. Having all the potential in the world, they could make this place fantastic. Considering my guest and I were the only ones eating in the middle of lunch hour I am positive that we are not the only ones who feel this way."
5855,2,"Bruegger's is connected to the building where I work. So, anytime I need to grab something quickly and it's raining or snowing outside, I come here. The food isn't spectacular, but it is dependable. You can create your own salad, and they usually have three soups to choose from. Because I'm not a big bread eater, I normally stick with soups and salad, but I do hear the bagels are delicious.\n\nThe chicken they use for salads looks and tastes like mystery meat, so go for the ham or no meat at all. There are a variety of veggie options for salads, so I usually do veggies. You can also add nuts, dried cranberries, or diced apples.\n\nToday I had the chili because I was craving something hearty. It was nice and spicy, and I could visibly see the chunks of bell pepper in the soup. I would definitely get it again on a cold day.\n\nThis location is convenient to almost anything on Grant Street or in the vicinity of the William Penn Hotel. The interior is on the small side, so if you want to sit during lunch, come at 11 or after 1:30."
24454,2,"It's Monday night, I just got off work, I was kidnapped, and I was forced to join the little lady for Reverse Happy Hour at Kabuki.  You know it's a terrible Monday when I'm okay with being dragged to a chain sushi restaurant and I don't make a single snarky remark about how their menu is littered riddled with the usage of Papyrus.  I mean, Papyrus!  Who the heck designed their menus?  Must be someone from Collins College [This sentence is for Linh L.].\n\nAlthough I shiver at the thought of dining at chain sushi restaurants [I think my hatred stems with RA], I actually had a decent time at this Kabuki [Tempe Marketplace's Kabuki = no].  Our waiter was prompt and attentive, only disappearing for short-bursts of time when our food was in front of us.  We shared a small seaweed salad, a Vegas roll, an Alaska roll, a Shrimp Tempura roll, and we each had a Tokyo Mojito.  Our bill came out to be $40-something which isn't bad considering we were both full off our rolls and that deliciously refreshing mojito.  We probably could've done without one of the rolls but our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs.  Happy Hour, huzzah!\n\nThe highlight of the night was watching some lady two tables away from us take her first bite of raw fish for the first time ever.  She promptly spit it up into her glass of water.  All that soy sauce and wasabi transformed her glass of water into L.A. Water.  I could go for another cocktail!\n\nI'll be back only for Happy Hour and a mojito."
20994,1,"Cannot recommend before safety standards are improved. \n\nPros: courteous, professional shuttle drivers who are punctual; office was helpful in rescheduling due to my delayed flight\n\nCons: Loose safety procedures. My single seat buggy lacked left foot rest, four point belt was checked only after I asked. Was not told which group to follow, turned out I was w the guide and two company mechanics, yet I was constantly left in the dust due to my groups familiarity and my sub standard buggy w reduced power. Trying hard to keep up, my buggy gave up half way up a slope the others cleared. I was told that some buggies were beat up so didn't perform well. Not one buggy had a raised flag; this combined w a group that weaved in and out, I lost the group often in the dunes. We were told to follow the guides path bc wavering just 10 ft could result in serious injury: on two occasions I lost the group and hit violent falls. Finally, when it's time to park, one of the staffs buggy rear ends mine, causing a not insignificant whiplash. All I heard was another staff jeer \""what the f r u doing?\"" followed by more banter among the staff. No apologies, as if rude behavior explained the \""it's all in good fun\"" attitude towards this potentially dangerous sport. \n\nI've done experience events w skip barber and Infineon raceway; all very professionally run and ran strict safety procedures.

42512,3,"Talking about Smoke's in a Montreal context is weird.\n\nEverywhere else in Canada, Smoke's is more or less the only game in town when it comes to poutine. What they mostly offer is a kind of stunt poutine that you can also find in the wilder sections of La Banquise's menu, but in massive, 'roided-out form. Theirs are nothing like the poutines you get at chipstands and most other greasy spoons in Quebec, which are a lot more minimalistic in their construction; fries, cheese curds, gravy, period. Almost every item on Smoke's menu will challenge your stomach to an epic wrestling match with the sheer volume of stuff they put in it.\n\nObviously, there's trad poutine on the menu, but there are literally hundreds of other places you can get decent-to-transcendent trad poutine in the city. Smoke's is not one of them. However, if you're in the mood for some laugh-in-the-face-of-death hot-rodded stunt poutine, go nuts. Their triple pork poutine is artery-clogging goodness at it's finest.\n\nSo get a tenner and laugh in the face of God for a spell while an awesome soundtrack of 80s detritus plays on the PA.

We had the Bun Thit Nuong (Grilled Pork with Vermicelli) and Grilled Pork with Rive. Both dishes tasted as expected. We checked-in on Yelp for 2 free egg rolls and they tasted good, but didn't look good. Judged purely on looks, the rolls were cracked.  One thing about the vermicelli dish is that the egg thing that came with it was severely burnt, so I passed.\n\nOverall, I'm glad we had lunch here because it offered something I was use to. There are probably other places that are just as good or better, but we stumbled upon this one."

7798,1,"I've been going to these guys for 7 years or so. Yes they have the cheapest oil changes around, which includes rotating tires. Look for their coupons. Now it seems they suggest work that doesn't need to be done. The latest is they said the rack and pinion needed to be replaced for $500. I brought my car to another shop which said they would love to charge me for replacing the rack and pinion but it doesn't need it, it's just an oil leak around the filter will be fixed with the oil change. This is at least the 2nd time Jack at Napa (the owner) suggested unnecessary work.  And Jeff doesn't work there anymore."
40849,1,"Conceptually you would think this place would be a hit! I mean sushi is hot right now. But the actually place has much more to be desired. First of all the menu is lackluster. I mean its a sushi place with barely any sushi! I could make better sushi at home and I have trouble not messing up a bowl of cereal! I bought a fancy sushi which i think was a rainbow roll and a regular spicy tuna. Neither was anything to shout about. I also got a side of seaweed salad which probably was the best part and I got a can of pop. Total bill: $19 with tax. I almost fell off my seat. But oh well. \n\nIf they want to make this competitive they need to take off the stupid hot dogs off the menu - its a sushi place. If I want a hot dog Ill go to franctuary. Two they should put pictures up of all the sushi variations they make and increase the variations and come up with unique concepts like a yinzer roll. Three they need to make lunch specials - 1 order of sushi and drink for $5.99 2 orders of sushi and a sushi and a drink for $10.99. something like that. And finally, they need to walk into penn ave sushi and realize that's your competition. Time to step up your game.\n\nWouldn't be surprised if this place goes out of business soon."
14935,3,This show was pretty great though I loved Zumanity even better (see review). I was staying with family at the Wynn so we splurged for tickets to La Reve. The acrobatics were really phenomenal and the dives into the gorgeous pools of water were amazing too. The show seemed to try to have a bit of a plot but the excitement and beauty of the acrobatics far out-weighed my interest in the story line. \n\nThey seemed to plan the seating extremely well for this show so that basically every seat in the house is a good seat. \n\nI don't think you can EVER go wrong with a Cirque de Soleil show! I definitely want to catch them all!!!
21186,0,"Stopped by this place after doing a quick stop at Target and looked pretty cool from the outside but, once inside their selection was TERRIBLE, they only had like 5 or 6 flavors or less if I remember correctly. I asked the rep. If that was all the choices they had and she looked at me like I was crazy and said, \""Uh, yeah.\"" Now I wouldn't of minded if the cupcakes were ATLEAST GOOD but, they were not! I got a total of 3 cupcakes my daughter got Strawberry with Strawberry icing, I got Red Velvet with Cream cheese icing and white chocolate filling (supposably) and my husband got a Chocolate cupcake with chocolate icing and chocolate ganache filing. Now to describe the cupcakes. They tasted like out of the BOX BATTER cupcakes! I mean they tasted exactly like what I can do at home! Come on Mad Hatters STEP UP YOUR GAME! I've been to other bakeries whose cupcakes were beyond amazing! Now when you charge me over $1 in filling you would think you would actually FILL it not put a dime sized amount! I definitely won't be coming here ever again and will not be recommending this place to ANYONE!"

40622,0,"tl;dr:  Expensive, not very good, they tend to overcharge you if you don't watch your ticket.\n\nI've had them a few times over last semester to try them out, I've been dying for a really good burger joint on campus.  First time I had a burger, fries and a drink.  Totaled over $12.  I found the burger to be over salted and overdone, but the fries were tasty.  \n\nDecided to try them again later in the semester, giving them a second chance.  Tried the sliders this time (you know, signature item).  Again, they were way over salted and I found the same thing happened to me as a previous reviewer, I was charged 3x $0.75 for the cheese on them and other prices were higher than the menu board (even 3x $0.50 for cheese is a bit high for slider-sized burgers).\n\nWell, in all I'm sad that there still is no good burger joint on campus."

46879,4,"Had the pleasure of checking out this place yesterday. It's a small little family run place tucked in the corner of a small strip mall. When you walk in you are greeted by the 2 owners who run the place and seem to do all the cooking. They know what they're doing.\n\nWe ordered the b&g special sandwich which is baked chicken, roasted red peppers, fresh mozzarella, and pesto. Awesome flavor. I'm craving it right now just thinking about it.\n\nWe also ordered a slice of cheese pizza for my little guy. It's was his first time having pizza and he loved it. I loved it as well because I got the leftovers.\n\nMy wife ordered a \""personal\"" pizza. It was more than enough for 1 person. She added artichokes, broccoli, and eggplant. The eggplant was strips of fried deliciousness. I'm a carnivore but I loved it. The wife was very impressed.\n\nAll in all this place is great. Non-assuming family run place with amazing food. The pizza is as good as any pizza I have ever had. Can't wait to go back!"
41175,3,"Yum! If you need a quick pizza come here, or better yet have them deliver. I love the thin crust pizza, will never get papa john's again when we order in. The pizza is always hot, flavorful, and fresh. Plus you can't beat the price and they mail out coupons too!"
30623,4,"Love this place! \n\nGarcia's is one of my favorite places to go for Mexican food. I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal here. Fresh ingredients, hot and tasty food, decent service. To start off, we love their chips and salsa and bean dip. These items alone are worth the visit! Chips are served hot along with fresh salsa and a spicy bean dip that I think they make, and if they don't, it's still really good! \n\nThe menu is pretty standard Mexican food items. I usually go for the Grande Burrito. It's made with fajita meats and veges. Comes with Charro beans and rice. Served with Guacamole and sour cream. The fajitas are excellent too."
39231,3,"Place just opened not to long ago, Wife and I wanted something simple, so we tried quite a few things! I had their Italian Beef sandwich, it was very tasty, nice cut on the beef and you have a options with hot peppers or sweet peppers, I tried it with the sweet so my wife can try it. One of the best sandwich I have had for a very long time. Wife had their cheeseburger, this was also very good, Then we shared their hot dog, its a Vienna beef dog, served on a kysor bun. Place is a Chicago style food joint, which I am not very accustom to, but what ever it is, it's very good. We will diffidently eat here often."
17981,0,"Uh...horrible food. And I was even uh, under the influence...the kind where anything tastes good, and it was still bad. I wouldn't eat here if I were starving in the desert. The Palms was a great place to stay, the 24-7 Cafe had GREAT food. It's too bad the buffet was so bad...."
28655,2,"It was my first time at the Suncoast. Came here after seeing a movie. We didn't want to do TGIFridays or the other restaurants in Suncoast as we wanted breakfast, and we didn't want  to spend a ton of money. I had a scramble, the wife had an omlet. The scramble was decent, quite a bit of flavor from the onions and peppers. The eggs were pretty well cooked. The homefries were pretty spectacular, as was the toast. The wife had a very very very overcooked omelet...the service was OKAY as our waitress disappeared for about 20 minutes after we had finished our meal. Would have liked to try the Chinese fare, but really wanted breakfast (at 8:30pm). Overall, not bad, probably would hit up again if I find myself hungry and at the Suncoast."
25985,0,"Had the worst meal of my life at Lion Brewery. \n\n1. I ordered French Onion soup as a starter. It tasted like an entire bottle of pepper had been accidentally poured into it beforehand, making it undrinkable/inedible.\n\n2. Ordered wings as the main course. They were, quite literally, battered in salt. \n\n3. Combined with the over-peppered soup and over-salted wings, my mouth was uncomfortable and on fire.\n\n4. My friend ordered a Chicken Pot Pie. He found chicken bone fragments in it.\n\nAll in all, not a good experience."
4409,1,"Sport Chalet only gets two stars from me because they do not carry ammunition which I was looking for on Saturday. I must say though, the staff was very friendly. The gentleman I spoke to did not hesitate to refer me to Dicks Sporting Goods. I appreciate the honesty and lack of excuses."
11835,2,"Spicy Catfish Salad is my favorite dish here.\n\nFood here used to be really good, but came here twice in the past month and I have to say they really disappointed me.\n\nPortions are very small.\n\nService is really lousy.\n\nThe crispy rice is very salty and doesn't taste good.  Their specialty beef (forgot its name...grilled beef thinly sliced with tamarind and coconut sauce) used to be my favorite, but this time is just mediocre\n\nReally sad this happened.  I usually look forward to going here every time we go to Vegas, but not sure if we would like to come here again.\n\nThere are so many other places which are worth visiting.  Maybe i'll be back in a couple of years....so long"
39811,4,"yum yum yum mexican food just off the end of the strip (:\n\nFor carne/beef, line up on the left.  For pork, line up on the right!  My usual order is something like 2 adobados + 1 carne + 1 lengua taco (have a friend order all the carne, and another order all the adobados, otherwise you will have to line up twice!)\n\nThis is a must-go if you are in vegas - cheap, delicious, tasty tasty food! Convenient parking, available seating.  What more can you ask for?\n\nLast time I came, however, half of their kitchen had been closed down for some reason and the wait time was ridiculous (close to an hour around lunch time).  On previous visits, my wait has always been around 20 minutes long around the same time (we have a habit of going right after hotel check-out, before driving back to socal!)  So that would be the only partly off-putting thing.  Fingers crossed for having the whole place back up and running again by the next time I visit!"
27353,3,"Party Mania is my first and only port of call when I am looking for a fancy dress outfit. Whatever the dressing up occasion, Party Mania will almost certainly be able to fulfil your needs. \n\nParty Mania sells a wide selection of different fancy dress outfits in packets which are handy, such as superwoman and an 80's disco outfit. They also sell a range of accessories to complete the perfect outfit, such as wigs, witch's fingernails, hats, masks and gloves. Party Mania also sell outfits for Hen Nights such as L-plates and garters. \n\nIn the run up to Halloween, Party Mania is always absolutely packed with people looking for the perfect costumes. They also sell make up, ribbons and feathers, which I have bought several of to complete my fancy dress outfit. The shop is situated just around the corner from the main University campus, George Square, so it is a handy place for students to go to for a costume. \n\nBalloons, banners and themed decorations are also available in this store. Party Mania stocks everything you could every want for the perfect fancy dress outfit, although it is a wee bit pricey."
21301,0,"I went to Cupcakes for my first time while visiting a friend in Scottsdale.  I bought a chocolate peanut butter and one of the skinny lemons.  The woman boxed my cupcakes as requested, as I ordered them to go.  \n\nThe cupcakes were individually boxed in carry out boxes, with the label on the top of the box.  However, for reasons I can't understand, instead of sitting the cupcake at the bottom of the box, the cupcakes were placed on their sides.  This caused them to get smooshed and all of the icing was stuck to the top of the box.  I have posted a picture of the lemon one, which I did not even try to eat.  The chocolate peanut butter I did actually try, and it wasn't very impressive.\n\nI will never go back to Cupcakes, and I would suggest everyone try Sprinkles instead.  The cupcakes are the same price and are properly packaged, as well as taste amazing.  Much better experiences, in fact I went back to Sprinkles twice!"
2796,0,"Don't waste your time.  Blah food, horrible service, the waiter was very nice but seemed way over worked.  The salsa had zero taste, my daughters cheese quesadilla was dripping in grease, they never brought her sour cream, but charged us for it.  My husband and I shared fish tacos and they were BLAND, the menu said they came with \""special sauce\"" but when they came there wasn't any sauce, we asked for it but never got it."

14158,2,"Red, White & Blue Restaurant is a lunch and dinner sit-down restaurant in the Mandalay Bay (next to Fleur by Hubert Keller).  The restaurant feels like a more contemporary version of a traditional American restaurant.  The restaurant's straightforward and kind of old-school decor (as well as the loud atmosphere) reminds me of a Daily Grill.\n\nThe restaurant (at least for lunch) features mainly classic dishes like buffalo wings, Reuben sandwich, pastrami sandwich, spaghetti and meatballs, tuna salad sandwich, and so on.  The menu and the prices felt similar to a lot of the 24 hour Vegas cafes though I found my experience at Red, White & Blue a little better.\n\nI had the seared ahi tuna, which was served with wasabi mashed potatoes and a citrus sauce, but I opted for the green beans instead of the potatoes.  The ahi tuna was decent.  It was served rare and was pretty fresh.  The citrus sauce was flavorful and light.\n\nThe green beans were cooked properly.  Nice crispness to them and also fresh.  There were also some pickled onions and asparagus on the plate and both were fine and added flavor.\n\nMy friend's lobster cobb salad was huge and it did not look that great.  I don't think she was that impressed with it.\n\nBoth dishes came with pretty generous portions.\n\nService was good.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.\n\nLike other Vegas restaurants, this place was overpriced.  Sandwiches were in the $13-$17 range while entrees were in the mid-$20s.  I've definitely had better food at the same prices, but I've also definitely had worse food in Vegas at those prices.\n\nThere are plenty of mid-range priced restaurants available at Mandalay Bay (like Burger Bar, which is okay, and Border Grill--I haven't been there).  Because of that, you may be able to find a better meal at the same price around here.  Still, Red, White & Blue was better than I expected and I wouldn't swear off coming here again under the right circumstances.\n\nParking is complimentary (both valet and parking structure)."
27354,4,"I was excited to spot this shop in Edinburgh during a recent trip to Scotland & England. The small, elegant store has the full range of Penhaligon's products, and a tremendously knowledgeable staff. The young woman who assisted me helped me to identify scents I liked, and worked with me to test out the various fragrances. Ultimately, through a process of elimination, we narrowed down my choices until I settled on my favorite (Bluebell). \n\nThough the scents are by no means cheap, you do come away with the fragrance that works for YOU, and a very high quality product. This was a holiday treat for me, but one that will last me all year, I'm sure! \n\nA tremendously enjoyable, personalized experience... Luxuriant without being fussy. Go there, buy things!"
32288,0,"I have been to this one many different times as it right down the street from my house and it is on the way home from school. I love taco bell; however every time I go to this location it is like there is something major wrong. \nAt first I thought that it was because I went during an off time, I used to work at a Taco Bell in CA and know that food only stays good for so long and during off times you will end up with the end of the containers or you will end up with gross old food.\n\nSo I did not write a review because it was just my timing. I waited and went at a busy high traffic time; and still was not happy with the quality of the food.\n\nEvery time I order the soft taco supreme they are always like wet and stuck to the wrapper, with the meat soaking through the wrapper. Thought at first this was me because it took me a whole 10 mins to get home; so the last time I actually just drove out of the drive-thru and sat in car and looked tacos they were already like that; I order mine special so that they cant use the premade stuff; yes as employees we would pre-make some of the most popular items to make it easy to give out, like the soft tacos; pinto and cheese.  \n\nThe beans on the nachos every time where cold and so gross! I am just wishing that they would pull it together because it is on my way and super convenient when I want something before I hit home."
1656,1,"I've been to this location a few times now, and I guess it's time for me to write a review of this place.  Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.  The reason I frequent this Trader Joe's is because its A) close to my office, B) there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and C) thier staff is always friendly and helpful."

19565,0,So first the lady on the phone read my order back completely wrong. I corrected her twice and when I arrived in 30 min to pick them up I had to wait another 10. The order was still in correct and nothing was offered in return. I love NYPD but not this one and I advise to go to another location.
35057,2,"Ever since I turned 30, when someone asks me: \""would you like to have a complimentary skin test?\"" I hear Monty Python's Spanish Inquisition sketch: \""Give her THE RACK!\"" \n\nThe thought of someone telling me the potential pitfalls and imperfections of my face after 30 years just seems like the silliest form of torture. If you have no idea what i'm referencing, pop yourselves over to youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt0Y39eMvpI) and waste five minutes in the best of ways.\n\nSo that's what I heard when the lovely lady at Elizabeth Arden asked me if I'd like to get my skin tested for radiance - a potential result that could only be compared to brilliant sketch comedy awkward.\n\nI don't know if it's a sales ploy, or if my mother's insistence that I wear sunscreen  daily actually did its job, but the result was much less painless then I imagined. In fact, i'm 95% radiant. That's right, i'm practically blinding you while you're reading this.\n\nWhatever it was, it made me feel pretty damn good about myself and after a quick chat, I happily bought my \u00a340 skin cream to maintain this 95% perfection. What struck me about this particular lady, is that no matter how ridiculous, I never felt swindled. Even when I asked what the best make up primer would be, she honestly pointed me in the direction of a different brand. I like that. She gets five stars.\n\nThe rest of the place however, is filled with surly looking staff that just seem to spend their time testing makeup on the back of their hands and looking bored. But the selection here is good and I can often cross eight birds off with one stone on a visit - so for that I give it a reasonable three stars. Eye rolling aside, it's a decent little pharmacy.\n\nBut if you're brave enough, wander over to Elizabeth Arden and chat with the lovely lady about how perfect your skin is. It's a hidden gem of an afternoon pick me up. Shine on ladies!"
41854,4,"Incredible service and attention to detail. Each person in our group of 4 was thrilled with their manicures. Peter and his crew are perfectionists and artists, and are committed to what they do. \n\nIt was my twin sisters' birthdays, and they both received a complimentary bottle of wine! We're not from Vegas, but this will be a part of our itinerary every trip!"
5134,3,"Good stuff, been coming for years. Glad its getting so much hype they deserve to make some money. Do yourselves a favor and dont expect a religious experience or you will be disappointed. Its simple food made fresh on site and very good."
40017,4,"Don't get me wrong the bugers were great, perfectly cooked, Five Guys strawberry was good. But it wasn't mindblowing. Now I say the location in front of the flatiron building is more fun looking than being packed like sardines in a resturant. But it was still fun and the line was long but moved fast. Would recommend for a quick cheap bite. Fighting people for a seat will be neccasary, not impossiable."
6656,1,"As far as automatic, non-do-it-yourself car washes, this is where you'll get the bang for your buck and a quick wash.  If that's what you're shooting for, this place has the whole routine down!\n\nEven with a basic wash, they'll wipe down the interior and clean the insides of the windows.  That's pretty cool, but they use ammonia-based cleaners to get the residue to evaporate faster.  That's fine when it's used in your house, but prolonged or repeated use of the stuff will dry out the vinyl and rubber seals on your car. \n\nThey janked up all the seat settings (slid them all back) so that they can get in there and wipe the dash.  Again, that's cool given how quick they wipe it down, but annoying.  Even without paying for the stinky perfume, the car still smelled like it anyway.  Eww.\n\nI believe that a DIY car wash (like the place out in Middleton or Sun Prairie) would be a better clean for ~$6, given you have your own sponge, cloth, soap, and bucket.  If you're short on time, Octopus has got your back.  Like Joyce said, it is what it is :)"
27107,2,"As far as budget accommodations go this place was alright.  The staff is friendly, helpful and flexible.  The dorm rooms themselves probably try and pack a few too many people in to them and the beds can be a very squeeky.  It's located a 7 or so minute walk from the heart of Old Town, which if you're staying for more than 3 or so nights can get a little repetitive.  \n\nOverall I'm sure better could be found, but if nothing appeared in a search I'd come back here with no real hang ups"
16002,1,"On our first morning in Las Vegas we chose the breakfast buffet where we were staying. It was unusually busy for a Thursday morning due to an influx of cowboys attending a bovine sale as well as the start of the PBR finals.  My breakfast included OJ, fresh fruit with strawberry yogurt, easy over eggs, a sliver of ham, bacon and a Tums. Everything was reasonably fresh.  We used our funbook coupons received at check-in.\n\nWe returned a week later for the luncheon buffet using a pair of free buffet coupons from an additional pair of funbooks.  I enjoyed a few small cocktail shrimp, a tomato salad, one BBQ pork rib, a few tiny meatballs and a fresh fruit tart."
33088,3,Dr. Khayami is fantastic. He is thorough and really wants the best results. The massage therapist is great and makes you feel relaxed with a massage prior to your adjustment. Went there with a neck problem and have really seen results.
12905,4,"I'm a big fan of this place, it's got a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain.  While the wait can be a bit long to get a table outside it's worth it.  The food is also cheap (but not you can taste it cheap).  Steak sandwich with caramelized onions YES PLEASE! oh i mean Oui, s'il vous pla\u00eet!\n\nThe atmosphere is really relaxing and I see no problem with catching a few drinks and watching the fountain show and people watching for several hours.  Service is prompt and proper with a wine cart assisting the crew to carry around some good inventory."

6117,2,"I'm a big Mexican food fan! This Monterrey location in Matthews always seems to hit the spot. Stopped by recently on a Saturday evening for dinner. Got right in! I ordered the chimichangas w/ shredded beef, fried. I know, I know, they do offer an non fried option, too. Great flavors w/ the guac & sour cream & side of refried beans. Topped it off w/ an ice cold Dos Equis. Can you really ever go wrong w/ an ice cold Dos Equis? The wife tried the Taco Salad w/ chicken. I enjoyed that dish as well. Is this my go to Mexican restaurant? No, but on a Saturday night when I'm hungry and not in the mood to wait too long, this is a great option."
49889,2,"I enjoyed this cute new spot at the district.  Service was great and outdoor seating was perfect with a view of the musician and lights in the district courtyard.  The strawberry beer was delicious.  My favorite appetizer was the sausages in the puff pastry, so yummy!  We also had the pretzel bite, fries and wings which were okay but the puff pastry was by far my fav.  Nice spot for happy hour and to enjoy a nice vegas fall night out in a relaxed atmosphere."
38144,3,"Last weeks creative loafing had an article about Bollywood Bites that inspired me to give it a shot.My co-worker is married to an Indian man and is quite familiar with the cuisine ( I am not) - so she offered to take a group of us in and help us decide what to get.\n\nBe warned: This place is difficult to find -CL didn't refer to it as a hidden gem for nothing. If you look on their website they give great directions with a map, making it much easier.\n\nAlso be warned that if your meal is under $10 it is cash only. We came with a group of 7 and waited for about a half hour for our meals...it is take-out only, so this may not be ideal for a workday lunch unless you work in the vicinity. They also do not have everything listed on their menu on a given day- so unless you are extremely familiar with Indian fare - I recommend going in and talking to the lady rather than calling the order in. She was friendly and helpful. \n\nDespite the above warnings, the food itself is really beyond delicious and earns the four stars solidly. My co-worker said it reminded her of meals cooked in her in-laws kitchen.\n\nI ordered the paneer tikka masala (Which was killer) make sure you get the roti that goes with it. I also had the Pani Puri (which isnt on their menu online). If you have never tried Pani Puri - get it now! So delicious..make sure you ask how to eat it though or you'll be lost. I had quite a bit of food for $9- the menu is super affordable. \n\nKeep in mind everything is vegan and/or vegetarian. \n\nThis gem was certainly worth the effort of finding!"
409,2,"You know what it's like when you just don't know what to say?  This is one of those times.  You see, I'm often wondering if my mom is going to slap me for not saying anything nice and then bitch-slap me for never listening.  Or something.  I really wasn't paying attention.\n\nOr maybe it is not that bad.  There are, after all, nice things to say about Matt's.  But there are spotty areas as well.\n\nFirst the good...\n\nThe decor is marvelous (insert mid-80s Fernando accent via Billy Crystal here).  They have a decent number of seats, the outdoor seating is second-to-none - but you can bring your own lunch and get that, so it's not really specific to Matt's.\n\nAnd the not-so-good...\n\nThe menu selection is immense.  So much so that you'll want to go when the place isn't crowded so that you have a reasonable chance of looking it over before ordering so as not to get in the way of anyone else.  That generally doesn't happen in most hot dog stands, either on the street or indoors because you have about two choices: All the way or plain, where you add your own condiments.\n\nAnd the rest...\n\nThough you can find Italian Beef and Chicago-style dogs in the same place, you don't always want to.  Focus on your specialty.  And that's the real problem here.  There is so much going on - visually and on the grill - that they don't seem to do anything really well.\n\nThough the staff is nice enough, and food is decent, it's just not that great.  Fries are limp.  House-made chips are nice and thin, but they are so thin that they can't support anything (dressing, chili leavings from dogs, not even the crunch from the fryer).  Dogs are average.\n\nI would much rather get a dog from Green's, or maybe Hap's, both of which have that awesome hot dog counter vibe and make me want more.  Matt?  Not so much."
46559,4,"One of the best beer selections in Pittsburgh. They have pages and pages of bottles categorized by type but also listing descriptions, alc. content and brewery. The Imperial IPA (draft, great tap selection too) I had was Dorado from a brewery in San Diego that I've never seen offered here before. The bartender was really attentive and nice to talk to. You can buy six packs and get 20% off of any 4 bottles or more that you take home. Lots of seating but I really liked sitting at the bar due to ample space and clear sight lines to the fridge bottles (labeled by country), taps and TVs. Also has an open window in the front."
27205,3,"Free wifi is a theme of all my reviews, and they have it here. There is also a fire going, a coal fire. The bartender let me have a piece of coal yesterday because it was the first time I had ever seen coal. He was amused. I was told it might be radioactive, and I left it in a cafe I was in. In hind sight, I think at was not very nice. \nAnyway. You can also put on any music you want, and their music is pretty terrible. So I always hook up an iPod. \nThey are chill about my writing group meeting here even if people only get soda water, though I have taken on an afternoon scotch habit. They can't do manhattans or old fashions, which is why I dock a star, because that's lame. Is this a bar or an alcohol stand at a fair?"
36437,4,"Most definitely one of the best if not the best tacos I have ever had. I got their lengua, cabeza, and carne asada tacos and I have to tell you... it is amazing. I really have nothing else to say. There are so many words that describe the greatness of this place but... I just can't. Speechless. \n\nPRO TIP: The wait is pretty long so definitely expect a long line... Come with 3 or more people so that you guys can wait in the 3 separate lines. There are three different lines (stations) with different meats so if you come with more people, you guys can wait in separate lines and get more variety. That's pretty much all you have to know. NOW GO!"
49090,4,"I recently purchased a Dodge Charger from Greenlight Auto and I couldn't be happier with the customer service I received.  Bill and his salesman Cody where more then helpful throughout the entire process.  Great place, great car selection and they are definitely a customer first place. I refer everyone I know to go try them out."
8263,4,"The Camelback Inn is like a little Oasis or taste of paradise in the arid Arizona desert.  This is the third time I have stayed here over a (long) weekend, Thursday through Monday, and I am just in love with the place.  The last time was seven years ago and I can't believe it took me so long to make it back here.  I blame the dance competition I come here to enjoy which moved to another location for several years.  WHAT were they thinking?  This place can't be beat for providing service and luxury at every turn!\n\nIt feels more like a gated luxury community than a hotel.  There are a series of bungalows connected by a series of rock lined paths and grassy havens instead of one large building.  As i walked along the paths during my stay I saw families of quail crossing my path and bunnies looking at me quizzically from the grassy patches.  None of the animals seemed to be intimidated by their proximity to humans and let us approach them without running for safety.\n\nThe pools were refreshing and one even had private cabanas for people to rent if they wanted a little more privacy.\n\nThe average rooms were like little luxury suites with a mini-kitchenette complete with sink, microwave, and refrigerator.  The bathrooms were very spacious with a main area containing toilet, tub and sink with large counters separated off by a door from a second sink area with voluminous counter space.  It was incredibly convenient to have the two separate sink/counter/mirrored areas for two people to be able to get ready at once.  The magnifying mirror attached to one wall was one of the best I've seen in any hotel bathroom.\n\nThe best part of the room was the beds.  They were so amazingly comfortable; even more comfortable than my own bed at home.  It's like the bed welcomes you and molds right to your body.\n\nOur room had its own semiprivate outdoor patio area complete with outdoor seating which was wonderful for sitting and enjoying the relative cool of the evening around twilight.  I didn't make it to the pool during this visit, but my brother did and recommends it quite highly.\n\nI haven't tried any of their restaurants, but they do have a Starbucks up by the main lobby which is perfect to help you get going in the mornings.\n\nThe ballroom was very attractively decorated and the lighting was fabulous.  The hotel staff, particularly Eric and Dan, were helpful getting everything set up for our event in the ballroom and checked back in frequently to make sure everything was running smoothly for us.  All of the staff at this hotel is so incredibly friendly.  Staff members smile and say hello as you pass.  This place is so friendly and accommodating I wish I could stay forever!"
8990,2,"3 stars might be a little generous. \n\nHowever, I do think Fry's generally has better prices (and better sales) on a lot of there electronics compared to other places (I guess I'm mostly referring to Best Buy). That being said, like others have pointed out the service isn't so great. \n\nI bought a new HP laptop here about 6 months ago. It was refurbished, but for all it had the price was great. Since I was getting such a great price I bought a 3-year warranty w/it that covered everything. Honestly, although I'm not sure if the sales guy was a all that knowledgeable about the product, he knew enough, and if anything didn't add up, I knew I had my warranty. \n\nAbout a month ago, there was an issue w/a driver that allows the computer to connect to the Internet. Honestly, I'm pretty sure I created the issue and it had nothing to do w/the computer itself (I'll leave it at that). That's what warranty are for, though. \n\nI took the computer into the store, and this is where my experience w/this Fry's was less the 3-stars. The tech helping me seemed knowledgeable, but lazy. He knew exactly what was wrong with my computer but flat out told me I was better off fixing it myself since the Internet in the store was slow, and I would probably be better off if I downloaded the program that could be used to fix it from another computer, and transfer it on to my HP. I explained to him that the other computer in my house was old, and the Internet ran pretty slow on it, but he assured me I'd be better off than letting him do it in the store w/Fry's slow Internet. I should have made more of a fuss over this, but they guy was nice enough and did give me instructions on what to do, so I just took his advice and left. \n\nWell, I wasn't able to do it myself. I came back to Fry's the following morning and the same tech was working & recognized me. I explained that I wasn't able to fix things myself and I don't care how slow the Internet in the store is, I'd be willing to wait for him to fix my computer, and he did. \n\nAlthough, the tech seemed knowledgeable, his laziness really bothered me (especially considering I don't live all that close to this store and I had to make two trips here because of said laziness)."
19859,3,"I came here to help prevent wear and tear on my body for the upcoming year of teaching. 12 years of standing all day is making for tired feet and tiny veins on my legs. This store had a great selection of inserts for shoes to help with arch support. The very sweet and helpful clerk walked me through which items would work best for me. She took my measurements to get me the exact size pair of socks. I left with a pair of insoles and compression socks. The store was clean, organized, and the clerks were very pleasant."
33413,0,"Disappointed is my one word attitude after visiting this pub. Out of four meals only one met expectations. The eggs were so undercooked the whites were more runny than the yokes. The red meats were cooked opposite our request. The \""rare\"" steak was overcooked and tough as leather. The \""medium\"" steak sandwich was still mooing. The server was awesome, but with completely disappointing food, and service alone does not make me want to return, and I won't. There are countless pubs in the area that I would pick over this one. They spent a lot of money on the decor, and none of it creating safe and appetizing food."
44835,0,Do not use this company to tow your car. My husband called to have our car towed and told them he would present our AAA card to them for payment.  They towed the car to the dealership and then informed us that the bill would be $147.00. When my husband reminded them that we were using triple A they then informed him that they don't accept AAA. Funny how they didn't let him know that when he made the appointment. Scammers!
27801,2,"I love the location and the feel of this pizzeria. It definitely feels more upscale than a normal pizza joint. Note to all parents, there is no kids menu, crayons or anything kid related here. We were kind of bummed about that. \n\nMy wife and I shared a large Caesar salad which was huge and we enjoyed it. Then for pizza we tried a large pizza with meatballs on one half of the pie. The size of the pizza was much smaller than we were anticipating. Grimaldi's and I clearly have different definitions of large. The pizza didn't look very appetizing when it was first brought to our table. Fortunately, we found out that it tastes a lot better than it looks. The pizza was great with a rich sauce and I loved the meatballs. The crust on the other hand was hard, flavorless and crunchy like a dog biscuit. I felt like a five year old with all of the crusts piled up on my plate. Ironically my three year old loved them.\n\nLastly we tried a sample three dessert platter with chocolate cheesecake, New York cheesecake and a cannoli. The cheesecake wasn't anything special, but my whole family enjoyed the cannoli. \n\nThe total bill was high for the amount of food that we received...especially when considering the \""large\""pizza. However we did thoroughly enjoy the pizza and cannoli so we will surely be returning to Grimaldi's in the near future."
8169,1,"Recently visited Frank and Lupes. Food was very good but service was slow. In fact, we had to go to the bar to order drinks because our waiter wasn't coming over to our table.  At the end of dinner, my dinner partner left the table to use the restroom, and our waiter came over and asked me if I was waiting to be seated......this after he had been already waiting on me for an hour and a half."
38920,1,"I've only been to Menchie's once.\n\nThat was about 6 months ago, and I haven't felt much desire to return since then. While the store's decorating scheme is delightfully kawaii*^_^!, and the gentleman working the counter was very helpful, ultimately, I just didn't care much for the product. \n\nI am a fan of tart yogurt, but yogurt cannot get by on tart cred alone. I sampled maybe half of the flavors on tap when I was there, and ultimately did buy a small cup of somethingorother (now, you *know* things aren't great when I can't remember my order), but each and every one left me feeling...flat. Like there was too much ice and not enough anything else. I'm not sure if there was something in the ingredients that was putting me off, or if it was just the excess of sugar and low/non-fat recipe combination, but I couldn't even finish my small serving because I was getting a headache from the weird texture/mouthfeel/lack of \""food-ness\"" (that's totally a word, btw). \n\nHonestly? I'd rather have TCBY. And you should know, that's not a TCBY endorsement.\n\nI *have*, however, kept my iconic pink spoon. That thing is great."
30265,0,"Maybe some locations just have bad kharma and are not meant to succeed....like a cold spot in a  haunted house,  this place just kind of makes me uncomfortable. Bad feng shui perhaps - or maybe it was the nasty food, drinks and slow service. I am really not sure. \n\nWhen I heard the beautiful story of the chef,  taking his crew from a franchise  to his own  start-up restaurant, every dot-com bone in my  body wanted  to enjoy  this place! \n\nThe service was slow and inattentive - even  though the place was pretty empty.  Camille H did a great job of describing  our food - I,  however, would put up a good umbrella stick fight about ordering the polenta with cold shredded chicken ever again. I still have to fight the gagging reflex every time I  think of that soupy substance they tried to pass off as hummus. The ceviche was good, but the crackers  were not.\n\nI won't go back."
24327,3,"I went on a girls trip for my friends 18th birthday and Palms Place was one of the only places we could stay at being so young. \n\nI was very happy with the hotel, the pool was great! We spent all of our days there hanging out at it, reading, and listening to the music they played.\n\nIf i were to go back to vegas I would definitely stay there again!"
43919,4,"i am in love with this place! i found Laughing Buddah through Groupon. it is one of the best discoveries i've ever made! i love it here. as soon as you walk into the yoga studio, there is such a strong positive light and energy. it is one of the very few places i can go and feel \""home.\""\n\ndusty, the owner, is such an amazing person. she always has a smile and a kind word and is genuinely happy that you're there. the other instructors' classes are great, but i gravitate more to her energy and feel a stronger peace during her classes.\n\ni've been practicing yoga for about 7 years now and Laughing Buddah is by far my favorite. so far i've invited my fiance and aunt to a few classes and they love it. i will be taking one of my good friends this weekend for her first class. i highly recommend it to everyone."
47670,3,Their pizza rolls are to die for! We get delivery from here once a week. The only downside is delivery usually takes 45mins at least..... I suppose it's worth the wait
14266,4,"I went to this place alone, around 3 PM on a Thursday, and it was pretty deserted. There weren't many people around, so I felt like I had the museum pretty much all to myself. The art is very contemporary and much of it takes up a large, open space. The museum seemed to follow a \""Open/Inner Space\"" theme. This is stuff you'd find in Phaidon's Cream series, if you're into those. There's a large variety of art as well. I really liked Sarah Oppenheimer's work. There would be a large red block on the wall, but as you got closer you'd realize it's actually created by a red light coming through a large hole in the ceiling. Go check it out!"
661,4,"Delicious Chinese food!  I had the Trio of shrimp, scallops & chicken and all food was very fresh and wasn't salty like other Chinese restaurants.  The servers were very  polite and this was a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!"
32243,2,"Food lion strip mall Chinese food, also offers deliver. Experience had always been good and food is exactly as you'd expect."
16422,4,Had a scoop of strawberry ice cream here. So good! They had so many other delicious flavors. The lady behind the counter was really nice. I have been here before & the quality of the ice cream is good!
14925,3,"Rosie's is mine and my sister's go to beer place. It is conveniently close and just very cozy. I always get the Magner's Cider which is so damn delicious, and Wenesday's live performer is always so delightful to listen to."
39457,1,"Not too happy about the house cleaning we received. It was ok but I definitely have had better and could of done a lot better myself. Especially for the money! \n\nPro's - Showed up 1/2 hour early, got to work right away, was very quiet, worked quickly. Vacuumed furniture which was a plus. \n\nCon's - Floors still had a bunch of food/dirt/gunk on them after sweeping and mopping, master bathroom mirror appeared to have been cleaned but then she must of sprayed a cleaner again because there were water spots all of the huge mirror, had to clean again. Didn't clean all of the blinds, missed some. Didn't touch the floor boards which I was told were included. The only reason the house smelled clean was because they sprayed something. It didn't smell like they used disinfecting chemicals like when I clean. \n\nIt was definitely not worth the money! And to top it off, I was a first time customer and they didn't even call me to see if I was satisfied or wanted to schedule regular cleaning, which I wanted to. Obviously I wont be using them and giving my business to someone else. Overall pretty disappointed!"
2196,1,Stick with sandwiches.  Everything else is so-so.

44428,3,"I have been wanting to try Drybar forever! So, when a friend was getting married on a Thursday, I figured it would be the perfect opportunity. \n\nWhoever booked my appointment over the phone was fabulous. She was so friendly, answered all of my questions, and got me in exactly when I needed to.\n\nI arrived a few minutes early, not knowing what to expect. I waited a few minutes and was taken back promptly for my appointment with Katie. I explained to her I wasn't really sure what I wanted, but that it needed to be quick. I also hadn't washed my hair since Monday in preparation for a possible Uptini, which is what my appointment was scheduled for. I showed her a few pictures on Pinterest, she gave her professional opinion, we agreed on a style and she went to work. \n\nNow, this is important: My hair was done in a half hour. A HALF HOUR!! She was super fast and it looked great. I had planned on being there for at least 1.5 hours. If you need a quick updo, book with Katie. You will not regret it. \n\nEveryone was friendly, it was clean, not too crazy busy, and they had The Devil Wears Prada playing. So fun! I'd love to try this with my girlfriends one day. \n\nThe only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because there was literally no conversation during my appointment. I wasn't sure if I caught Katie on a bad day or if she was just in a super hurry to get me in and out like I asked. I just kind of felt like she was annoyed with me, I hope she wasn't!!\n\nI'll definitely be back."
35156,4,"I was introduced to this restaurant a few weeks ago & I tried the crispy seafood pancake with combination fried rice. The seafood pancake was pretty good but it had clam or mussel (not a fan of 'em) in it so I'll be sure to just order the shrimp. Can't forget about the Thai tea, it's super sweeeet! The restaurant is clean, quiet, & our waitress was sweet. I will be returning & ready to try different Thai dishes there. :)"
11676,4,This place is amazing.  One of my two favorite spots in AZ so far.  \n\nThe lobster quesadilla is awesome.  not your typical quessadilla but way way better.  the flank steak torta was very good too.  i can't wait to go back and try everything else.
26868,4,Banh Pho and Bun are both awesome. Love this place.
14386,4,"Cibo itself is a oxymoron. Very cozy but large. Very romantic but busy. I will explain that later. This Italian restaurant is that but much more. On the corner of North 5th Avenue and West Filmore. At night, you will see a house lit up with strings of white lights and the sound of a guitar playing sweet melodies. \nGetting there was a small challenge for me. Not being from Phoenix and not being familiar with side streets. My main route was using the freeway. Which I am not a particular fan of. \nThis night, Friday, was filled with a lot of ambulances, cop cars and fire trucks with lights and sirens blazing. One incident, my wife counted around 12 of these emergency vehicles going the other way on the freeway at the same time. I just pray that they all got there on time to help the people who were in need.\nGetting closer to the restaurant. You can see the tall buildings of downtown. We were following the maps app but a lot of the streets are not well lit. So we missed a street or two. Luckily we did find the restaurant. Again the strings of white lights and the guitar music were a good indicator that we were here. Plenty of parking on West Filmore street.\nBesides the front patio dining. They have a small bar once your inside. The bar itself holds, at most, 9 individuals. A good selection of bottled beers, wine and shots of different cocktails. My wife tried a limoncello drink that she thought was real good. Too bad she got the last one so she couldn't order another.\nWhat makes this restaurant cozy but large is the inside of the restaurant is broken up into smaller rooms. So you never see everyone who is dining there. You can just focus on your present company and the meal you are sharing. This also explains the being romantic and busy part. Waiting for your table you see servers and patrons going back and forth. It's not until you get seated into one of those smaller rooms that everything starts to slow down.\nThe crowd that eats there is a very diverse crowd. From hipster guys and gals to men in suit and ties and women in dresses. Young and old come here.\nAnd they come for the atmosphere but mainly for the food. Great Italian fare. Pizzas, pasta dishes, colorful salads. The food is amazing. House chop salad is great, 3 pairs of different prepared bruschetta is great and the bolognese sausage dish that I had was so good. It was all delicious. If you come here. You will not be disappointed."
33020,3,"I was visiting family and took my sister's car to get a wash after our long road trip from Chicago. \n\nThey did a great job here. They were friendly, had a military discount, did a very thorough cleaning and were very nice. They removed her antenna's and had a nice system of cleaning the cars. The only complaint I had was that it took way too long from start to finish. We were there almost an hour, if not just over an hour. \n\nIt was just too long but they did a great job and we were very happy with it."
22331,0,"Not impressed - I ordered two meals to go and did not get the large coke I ordered, I asked the cashier where it was and she sent a guy back to get it. He returned with a cup and no straw and had to be sent back again? He returned and attempted to hand me a tiny little cup? I said that doesn't look like a large. He said \""well, I'm new, it's all I could find soooooo....???\"" To which I replied \""well I paid for a large coke and that is not a large sooo...???\"" So then he found a manager who was able to locate cups (?) and she gave me my coke. There was no butter in the bags, and I ordered 3 stacks of pancakes in both meals and got 2 pancakes each. I'm annoyed that they didn't get my order right, they I had to be kept waiting while they figured out where the cups were (are they hidden somewhere in a magical IHOP cupboard...?) and that they gave me whatever cup was lying around, because it's all that the new guy could find, and that's ok? I'm sorry if you are new, but ask someone if you don't know, rather than just giving customers whatever you can find!!!"

47117,4,Ok. So today was my first day coming to this place after having horrible experiences at other nail salons and all I can say is that. This salon was amazing. they did my nails exactly like I wanted them . Staff was super nice. I walked away happy and I have officially made this my nail salon place :)
38805,1,Second time eating here and ordered take out. The people were nice but we waited almost an hour for our order just to realize they forgot our appetizers. Food was decent but the potstickers were very thick and doughy. 2 of the 4 of us got sick from it. Not sure i want to go back.
40846,0,"Dr. Lorena P. was hard to understand, impolite, and had a terrible bedside manner. She never once said \""Please or Thank you.\"" nor smiled. \nPay first to find out they couldn't do anything. \nNot even a referral or a recommendation. \nWas told over the phone by staff to come by. Staff needs some education on what their policies are so patients don't make wasted trips that could compromise their health through lost time."
24393,1,"The location and atmosphere are tops, service is fine, food is forgettable.  I can say this because I ate there about a month ago, and now that I'm getting around to doing the review I can hardly remember what we had - a rare thing from someone who can recite an excellent meal course by course for years afterwards.  we did started with quesadia, and the four os us all got different dishes, all of which I tasted and not of which were either outstanding or offensive.  The red wine selection is heavy on the highly fruity/jammy styles.\n\nThe location next to the light rail on Central, and with the big outdoor patio can make a trip to Maizie's worthwhile if you are looking for a place sit, talk and nosh, if nosh isn't your key focus.  My husband and and I went with some relatives we hadn't seen in ages, and it was a great place to sit and catch up for a few hours.  And despite the crowd's that evening the server was gracious about not hurrying us out of there."
26729,4,Love the chicken teriyaki here . Cute little booth set ups and love the bar set up . Husband love the beer and sushi .
43526,0,Always mess up my Menudo.  Always ask for no pigs foot and they always add it. They might think this is funny. That's okay. Going to El Mirage from now on. Added picture.
16367,1,"I finally had a chance to try out Joe's last night with my family.  I hate to say it (I really wanted to like the place) but I wasn't very impressed overall.  The food quality overall was very average, nothing stood out as phenomenal from any of our choices (we sampled from each other's plates).  Not to say anything was bad, just not superb.  The portions were a little small for the price.\n\nAll in all it was an okay experience, but the price ($40 for 2 adults and 2 kids) is high enough to keep us from going back."
44406,2,"Roomie and I were quite excited about the fact that a soul food restaurant opened up within walking distance of the house. We were even more excited about the fact that it delivers. He ordered the chicken and waffles ($9) and I ordered the fried chicken with sides of macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, and corn ($14). The ordered was delivered in 45 minutes. The chicken and waffles were good enough to satisfy the craving. The waffles seemed too similar to an Eggo waffle for me to give much praise too. My order of fried chicken as well as the fried chicken topping the waffle lacked any flavor and was overcooked. The skin and batter was a dark brown color and was slightly bitter. The macaroni and hush puppies were mediocre and the corn was straight out of a can. All in all, not terrible, but for the price, I probably will not eat there again."
21493,2,"Not too bad. But why does the Keno start at 900am? Had breakfast here and waited an extra 15 mins to check the Keno #'s after we were already done eating breakfast. That's our own fault though.\n\nIf you restaurant has so-so coffee (especially at a 24-hour joint like this)...you don't deserve 4 stars plus. \n\nOrdered the spam, eggs and rice...nice!!! Can't go wrong with that. Mac salad was a bit bland. Service good and the lines went fast. And btw..I won back my $4 from Keno when I hit 3 numbers! LOL!"
48794,0,"I really didn't want to write this review but I'm so mad and no one is answering the phone. I've called three times and it just rings and rings. The first time I went to Kneaders on Ray, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich and thought it was great. I work in Ahwatukee and it was a quick grab through the drive through before heading back to Tempe where I live. I went back the next week for the same order through the drive through. When I got home, they had forgotten the bacon on my Turkey Bacon Avocado. I was bummed. I mean, the bacon is the best part! But I let bygones be bygones. I even went back today. Same order through the drive through. When I got home, I was starving, had the baby in the backseat crying, was struggling with my bags and was ready to eat my sandwich in peace. But they forgot the bacon AND the avocado. I am probably too upset about this. My husband thought I had gotten some terrible news--I was close to tears. I just wanted to call the manager and tell them that that they should tighten up protocol but they didn't answer which made me even more mad, so here I am, not wanting to be mad but fueling it all by writing this review. I guess the moral of the story is check your food when you go through the drive through--but I shouldn't have to peel through the layers, hunting for crucial, delicious parts of a sandwich that are IN THE TITLE OF THE SANDWICH. So I won't be back. I feel a little bit better now. But not much."
36524,1,"Service is a negative 5..  atmosphere is 5   ...   paul Wells, the one man band is great.....  Service on the other hand was the worst I have ever seen....

18464,1,"Nick's is local to me and I would have loved to make this a fav as I can walk to it. \nMy first visit I sat in the bar after having sushi next door. This was o.k. and I may repeat this. \nHowever, on my next visit my friend and I tried to enjoy dinner. We were asked to sit at a smaller table outside vs. a larger table for bigger parties. Ok but when some people came in that were repeat customers and they sat at the table we wanted but there were only two, well that was somewhat rude. \nThen the waiter catered to their order and needs over ours. Such as when he did bring our food and asked us if we wanted parmesan cheese. We said yes. He then went to the kitchen and retrieved the food for his favorite customers and then brought the cheese for them and then brought it to us. Maybe they are big tippers but as someone that was looking to be a regular I may have been too. \nThe food was good but for gluten free they really do not have many choices. I have been going to another restaurant in the area and they have excellent choices with better service. Unless I am dragged here again I most likely will not return for their food."
8574,3,"Called in a to go order for a quick meal on a Sunday night for my wife and I. Was immediately greeted by one of the staff as I walked in and directed to the take away counter. During my short walk to the counter I found the restaurant to have a nice visual ambience and trendy modern decor with music that might have been just a touch loud. Overall, seems like it would be a decent place to go for a quick meal. The girl who brought my order was friendly and I was in and out very quickly.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the \""One Thousand Bean\"" open face pita and my wife ordered the Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. The bean pita had a fairly substantial pita with a layer of brown rice and medley of cooked beans with tomato, cilantro, and red onion as garnish. Overall, the ingredients were all quality and fresh. The bean blend gave it a nice mix of flavors but overall I felt like it was missing some spice and perhaps a little citrus or something to brighten up the flavors. My wife's wrap left similar impressions. The turkey was surprisingly good with a touch of honey sweetness without being overkill like a lot of other deli turkey. It also had a nice pesto and the grilled tomatoes added a nice touch but overall it still seemed a bit plain tasting.\n\nAll in all, the food was made with quality ingredients and was good albeit a bit plain. Prices seemed a touch high at first but I think the quality and portions justify it. Will likely go back to try more in the future."
21319,1,"I went here today for some coffee and maybe something to eat.  \n\nThe door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.\n\nGetting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.\n\nI walked up to the counter and a girl said \""hi,\"" I said, \""hi,\"" and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... \""so is this your first time here?\"" would have been nice.  Just silence.\n\nI ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though. \n\nI went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading \""dirty dishes,\"" that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.\n\nThe owner thanked me and said goodbye on my way out."
25813,2,"So, in the last two weeks I have come here for two separate issues.\n\nThe first, being that I stupidly fractured my coccyx (tail bone). I was seen after a short wait, and taken care of promptly and thoroughly. Dr. Guy did a good job at taking care of my situation, requested an immediate x-ray and saw me right after I was done to discuss my results, options, and pain relief methods. You never know how valuable a body part is until it's battered, leaving you completely dysfunctional and in mind-blowing pain.\n\nThe second, I was having severe bursts of pain in my abdomen. I went to the clinic first because it happens to be right around the corner from where I live, and I needed to be seen immediately. I was shaking, crying, pale and obviously in extreme distress. Although I understand this is simply a clinic, the fact that I was turned away due to over capacity came as a shock. Considering the severity of my ailment, I would have appreciated it more if a doctor had seen me, even if temporarily, just to help relieve the pain I was in as I awaited my transportation to the emergency. \n\nI will still come here in the future when push comes to shove, but my last experience wasn't so great and has shown me that they are not willing to bend the rules in extreme cases that involve a person's wellbeing and health."

46961,1,"Made a reservation through open table for a party of 6 during Restaraunt week.  Between our party we had a combination of the appetizer sampler for 2 (fish tacos, bacon wrapped bacon & eggs, chicken pot pie nuggets) all were good, the chicken pot pie nuggets were lacking something in flavor , maybe salt? For entrees we had the crispy fried game hen and shrimp and grits while the other half of our party ordered the niman skirt steak, again all were ok, nothing memorable with the exception of the bacon wrapped bacon & egg appetizer.   About midway through our meal, we finally received our sides ( that we had to ask about) of zucchini and mac and cheese.  The dessert options included freshly baked cookies and milk or trio of sorbets.  The cookies were good, again nothing I couldn't have baked in my own oven at home.  When our check came we were surprised to see all the extra fees we were not aware of: restaurant week charity donation as well as the appetizer upcharge.  I've been doing research on the restaurant week menus and never noticed an upcharge fee on the online menu, the physical menu nor were we told at the time of order, they also changed the price from the website from $40 to $50.  Should've chose a different restaurant for RW or ordered a la carte from the menu.  Will probably not be returning or recommending. Jameson mule was pretty good though"
34860,4,"Love this place. I usually order for pick up and i usually make my own pizza. Grilled chicken with jalapeno. The crust and sauce are amazing. If you decide to dine in they have specials like 2 slices of cheese and a drink for around $5.95, I think? But the food is always good and service is always on point. I'm definitely a regular here."
15791,2,"We decided to give this restaurant location a try, We'd been to their Bell Rd location and were not impressed by their service. As a matter of fact, we've never been back and we live very close. So we tried this location with trepidation and am I glad we did. Food was good, service was excellent. The bread they start you out with is great!! We all had Choose your own pasta/sauce etc and 3 of 4 were excellent. ! of us had chicken on her sauce and it was not good tasting, but we were in a hurry and didn't make it known to the server. 3 of us would go back as the Rustic Roma sauce was very good."
36034,4,"I've been following Pinkberry for awhile and anxiously awaited for their expansion to the East coast.  So when I heard they opened a new store in Charlotte over by Southpark (Phillips Place), I had to check it out.  My first time experience was fantastic.  The girls working the counter were energetic, friendly and very helpful.  After some samples, I went with the coconut yogurt, raspberry, pineapple, chocolate crisps and yogurt chips.  It was absolutely awesome and I can't wait to do it again."
9620,1,"let me start off by saying im from NY...\n\nThis pizza is a joke, its not pizza by any standard. over all for VEGAS pizza its passable, but when i say passable i mean just that. Its edible, it looks and tastes pretty much exactly like papa johns or little ceasars. Id have to say dominos is still better then theres. \n\nyou will def not want it again. \n\nI do have to say though, the staff is great and the place does look nice and has a great feel to it.\n\nunfortunately there sauce is bland if they made there sauce better and there crust thinner it might be salvageable. oh well guess im not in ny anymore gonna just have to make my own pizza."
9832,1,"I stayed at this hotel as a week from my parents' timeshare.  As far as timeshares go, this is pretty substandard.  I stayed in a one bedroom which was incredibly small compared to one bedrooms I've seen at other timeshare resorts.  The bathroom was tiny with zero counter space, the bedroom barely had enough room to walk around the bed and the closet was smaller than mine at home.  There was no full length mirror in the entire room which is honestly a necessity in a place like Vegas.  The \""balcony\"" was basically just small platform you could stand on.  It was only big enough for one person at a time and no furniture or anything to sit on. \n\nThe pool area was beautiful and got sun all day, which was great for me, but if you're looking for somewhere to actually swim, this isn't the best place for you.  The pool itself is small and is usually filled with children.  There was supposed to be a rule the there were no children allowed at the pool after 5pm.  This rule was not enforced at all, not even after I spoke to multiple people about it.\n\nBasically, this hotel is great If you're looking for a place walking distance to the strip that you can pass out in after coming home drunk at 4am or if you want to tan all day by the pool.  If you're looking for any other sort of activity or enjoyment in your room or at the hotel, go somewhere else."
33195,1,"I found Kathy's from yelp.  I love to support local businesses and she was really friendly on the phone.  I only had a few pairs of jeans to tailor to the right length.   Kathy was great.....very friendly and chatty.\n\nBut, I got 6 pairs of jeans back......and every single one was too long or too short.  I spent $150 on tailoring and I ended up having to bring them to someone else.  I'm not sure how you screw up on jeans.....seems pretty basic.\n\nIf you're having anything major done, like wedding or prom related, I would not recommend Kathy.  ouch, sorry to say that...but to mess up on simple jeans is not a good sign for anything major.\n\nI'm giving it 2 stars just because how nice Kathy was....but for business overall it's like a 1 star.  sorry"
19589,0,"I tried this restaurant due to it's proximity to hiking in the Superstitions.  We stopped by after a hike.  The only positive that I have is that the place looks nice and has a nice patio with a waterfall.  I ordered a green chili burro and my wife ordered beef tamales.  Several minutes after I placed my order the waiter came back to tell me they were out of green chili.  No biggie here but at a good restaurant I would expect the waiters to know if they were out of something this basic before the order went in.  \n\nI changed my order to green corn tamales.  When the waiter brought the order out he could not tell which plate had the beef tamales and which were green corn.  He takes the plates away for about 5 minutes to figure it out.  So we were teased with a preview of our meal only to be left hungry for 5 more minutes.  \n\nWhen he brought the plates back we discovered that they were both beef tamales.  I tasted one and it was hard, salty and not at all like any tamale I had ever had.  He took my plate and re-order my tamales.  It took too long for the re-order to come out.  My wife was pretty much finished by the time I got my plate.  She was disappointed in her meal but to starved to hold back from eating it.\n\nMy green corn tamales were better than the beef tamales but not good.  They smothered them with cheese and drenched the plate in a runny sauce.  The rice tasted like rice and tomato sauce and the beans were just straight up nasty.  I could not eat more than one bite.\n\nAs starving as I was from the hike I could not come close to finishing the plate.  I left still hungry.\n\nThe waiter, although friendly, did not offer any amends to the lack of green chili or the tamale mix-up.  \n\nI'll never go back to this place.  Overall this was the worst restaurant experience I have had in a long time."
45875,1,"Gave this place 3 honest tries. 3 different items, 2 different times of day over a month period. The food just doesn't taste that great. \n\nOmelette... Burnt, small portion, with frozen style cubed potatoes. \n\nTuna melt... Flavorless tuna salad, and needed more salt mixed in.\n\nBurger... I'll post a photo... If that's medium well, I'd hate to see well... Maybe if I buy enough well done patties, and put them into a trash compactor, they'll turn into man-made diamonds! Fries were limp and definitely the cheap shoestring kind (suggestion - put them in a separate breathable bag for to-go orders, so that their own humidity doesn't make them into a soggy mess) \n\nPricey for this quality of food, and they probably justify it because they have a juicer behind the counter, making them a \""healthy\"" place that can charge a premium. Take your money elsewhere for a better lunch or breakfast experience..."
17471,4,"This place is amazing! Very crafted cocktail that taste wonderful. They have a \""smash\"" of whatever type of liquor you like with whatever fruit you like muddled into it with some triple sec for sweetness... I chose strawberries and lemon with vodka and it was so fresh and delicious!"
33248,0,"We live nearby and thought it would be great to try a local dental office.  Both times my husband and I went in the dental hygienist talked, and talked, and talked to the point of annoyance.  Also, the dentist informed my husband that he needed a considerable amount of work done.  We waited a year (finances!) and went back to our prior dentist - listed in the Phoenix Magazine's \""Top Docs\"" - only to find that NO WORK was necessary or even recommended."
16622,1,"We stopped in here last weekend for a quick bite before meeting friends.  The restaurant itself is cool, hip and modern.  Service was very good too.  \n\nThe real issue was with the food.  We ordered the mac n' cheese and the sliders.  Both were incredibly underseasoned.  I think the food has potential but I'm wondering if they had a substitute cook that day."
6956,2,"I would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids. This is a no frills airline. Nothing special. There was no TV, period on our 5 hour flight from NY. All the kids in the plane were going nuts. The seats are very cramped and small. The plane seemed very old. \n\nGo Delta, if you have kids."

33369,0,"Me and my friend came here to support a local business vs. going to a chain restaurant. The waitresses didn't know anything about anything on the menus. I guess they're new.\n\nMy entree was 3 eggs, burnt at the bottom, raw on top (how did they do that?)\n\nThese eggs were on top of a pound of soggy tortilla chips in verde sauce with bits of sour cream floating around. not a joke. I tried eating it, I think I got through 2 eggs and a few spongy chips in my mouth before I stopped.\n\nThe waitress told me that it's because this is 'real' Mexican food. I'd bet the entire 10% off coupon she gave me before I left that it's not."
16718,1,"This is probably one place that is a hit or miss for me. Visiting from Chicago, I was excited to see how Asian fare would be in comparison. Satay has a clean and cozy ambiance to it when you walk in. I came with a big group and unfortunately that probably contributed to my overall experience here. We attempted to wait for  everyone's dishes to come out but that was a bad idea. All of our food got cold because it took a good 50 min for everyone's dishes to come out after the first person getting theirs. Eventually we stopped waiting but all those who waited already had cold dishes in front of them.\n\nAside from that, my food and the flavors itself was not really anything out of the ordinary. I ordered chicken pad thai, a pretty basic and popular dish that really cant go wrong. Mine came out pretty bland unfortunately. I don't really see myself coming back here on my next visit unless its for happy hour or something."
44539,2,"Gadzooks is a new taco joint in the Phoenix area, only their main staple is enchiladas not tacos. Sorta like Chipotle, but different. Overall, the good was pretty good but heavy for lunch. The issue this with Gadzooks is the choices, simply way too many of them. I counted a total of 7 distinct choices you need to make to get your enchilada, And halfway through the process, they pop it in the oven to heat. This maybe viewed as a positive by some, but not me. Why, takes too long to get your food! \n\nLong story short, decent food but the long wait will keep me away."
3505,3,"Been a member for 6 months and really like it. \n\nScottsdale Gun Club never gouged like the others when ammo was in short supply and I appreciate that. \n\nIt's a great club with an incredible training staff (I have taken 3-4 classes and each one was top notch). \n\nMy only suggestions are they need more classes as they book up fast and are booked out months in advance. \n\nOn weekends and holidays there is usually a short wait. A few other reviewers complained about the fact that Scottsdale caters to members and puts members in the front of the line. Ahhh of course they do - IT'S A CLUB so members should and do always get to use the club first, visitors second. \n\nMy only other critic of the club is that many times it is difficult to find someone to help when you are looking to purchase. Dark blue shirts are newbies and work the register and range checkin - black shirts do the selling and red shirts are management and trainers. \n\nIt can be frustrating when you want to see a firearm or have a question and you ask a blue shirt - they sorta look at you like huh!\n\nSo if you want to buy - find someone with a black shirt and flag them down."
38985,3,"Went here last weekend and had a great meal. It was pretty busy when we arrived, which is always a good sign. We wanted to sit on the patio since the evenings have been so nice lately and the host said it might be a little while. Not a problem, we just went to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. He came by once or twice after to ensure us that we would be seated soon, which was nice. \n\nI had heard good things about the cocktails and ended up ordering the No. 17. It was awesome and I would definitely order it again. My sister got the No. 6 and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well. We decided to split the fondue and crab cake BLT. The fondue was great and the pretzels and sausage were perfect dippers. The crab cake BLT was good, but nothing really memorable. I don't think its anything against the sandwich itself, but just that I realized I prefer crab to crab cakes. Church potatoes were an awesome side! \n\nService was attentive and the food was well spaced out. We weren't rushed and enjoyed spending the evening enjoying the nice patio dining. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place."
3486,4,I could go on and on about how great everything is at the McCormick Ranch Golf Club.  My daughter just got married there and it was amazing.

46215,1,"No longer my favorite as they limit their wifi on weekends! The two stars are for the wifi, not for the coffee. While everything else stays the same, their service for providing a cozy study spot is no longer excellent! Two stars for the wifi, as they still provides wifi started at 2 PM."
5808,2,"THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!!! Oh. WOW. Yes. The food is a tasty treat. I got the Toad in the Hole and it's in the running for my last meal.\n\nBeer selection is also delicious. I love that they have 5-6 beers on cask. There is enough variety to please beer drinkers of all shapes and sizes.\n\nSo, why the 3 stars? Oh, because it took 90 minutes for our food to come. It got pretty frustrating watching people sit down after us, eat, and pay the bill as we sat and twiddled our thumbs. We actually didn't twiddle- we drank. And got drunk before the food came. Classy.\n\nOur server was a nice dude- he took 10% off the bill... but I'm pretty sure he forgot to put our food in.\n\nUltimately, I WILL be back because this place is the cutest. I am sure I'll have a better experience next time."
45278,4,BEST Carpet cleaning company I've ever used. Luiz is the owner and operator and he's amazing! He's friendly and FAIR/HONEST on price. The machines they use actually work unlike other companies. They actually scrub the carpets clean! Great work Eco Fresh!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
17524,1,"I give this place 2 stars only because the waitress was very annoying, she was walking back n forth and all around us talking very loud. Even when approaching us to ask questions when no one but another couple was in the restaurant she was very loud. I could not enjoy my lunch on my day off from work when all I wanted to do is go out to eat and relax. The chef that served us was very nice, friendly, and I enjoyed his service. I do want to come back because the sushi was great but service like that is not pleasant."

30764,2,"It's actually called the Huntridge Diner. I went here for lunch last week and yeah I guess it was A-ok. I had the daily special, which for Tuesday is a Burger, Fries and Soda for $6.95. The burger didn't taste like much but it wasn't bad. The fries probably came from Sysco but they were battered and pretty tasty. Everyone was very friendly including the girl at the front cashier counter and even the cook. Besides me there was only one other customer in there so the service was good."
35294,1,"I have NO idea why people are raving about this. I was a fan of them on the ABDC, but as a Vegas show they completely FAIL. The only good thing about the show was the music and when they did the first few moves from \""Single Ladies\"" - that cracked me up. \n\nOtherwise...  the attempted \""plot\"" was lame and made no sense (what's with the dead janitor please?) The dancers were out of sync. The costumes were boring. And the masks completely detracted from any personal connection to any dancer. \n\nSo my rec is: if you score free tickets, watch it, but don't pay for it!"

42033,1,"Trent is a gift entertainer but the female dancer, must go.  She adds nothing to the show and in fact, takes away from Trent's amazing talent.  While she is a great dancer, it's not fit for this show.\n\nTrent - you need to be on iTunes!  What a waste of talent to not have your voice heard by many Elvis fans.  \n\nGet more active on social media, you deserve it.  The show would be over the top good if you get rid of the female dancer. Several people walked out of show and were mumbling about her dancing.  \n\nI will come back again and again, but not with the dancer.  Trent is the star, not her.  She isn't even a compliment to the music or show."

I called at 2:30 pm, made it into the place by 3 pm, had them inspect all my brakes, was told that I only needed to replace the back ones, and that even though my tires were cracking that I could still get another 1-2k miles out of them.  The cracks were more due to the kind of rubber composite the tires were made of.  And I had an oil change and was out the door by 4:30 pm.  Fast, honest, and fair.  I think I've found my new mechanic."
17400,4,Nice ambience and delicious food! Its never too crowded and the salmon green curry is amazing... This is my favorite thai place in the area. I wish they delivered during the day though :(
49131,2,"The pictures of the burgers looked super crazy and deadly but the portions are actually very feasible. Our group of 5 shared: sashimi \""won-tacos,\"" triple T fries, the original ringer burger, and the bacon mac-n-cheese burger. We probably could have stuffed ourselves with another item. My favorites were the fries and the original burger. The fries were super crisp and full of truffle flavor, especially the aioi. The original burger had the flavors I like most, although I think the bacon mac-n-cheese is more unique and a good combination to try.\n\nTo me, the burgers are a little better than your average burger but not a favorite I would want again and again (I still prefer Bachi burger or even Holsteins). The tacos were definitely a let down- super small portion of tuna and not very interesting. Overall, I would only come back for a beer and some of those fries."
11573,2,"I walk by here on the way to work, and spied some amazing looking humus, waffle fries, and burgers sitting on tables on the patio more than once, so I decided to take my mom and sister when they visited.

41309,2,"I was led here by Emily R. who posted the most DELICIOUS looking photo of a wrap from Parsley, so I purchased the Groupon and off we went to Parsley. For our family of 4 (2 adults & 2 small children), we ordered a ton of food, but were able to finish it all, and without the Groupon, the total would have come out to about $40.\n\nMy husband ordered a large steak shwarma wrap combo on wheat (I love that it is an option), I got the chicken shwarma salad, the kids shared our food plus falafel, and two baklavas (squares, not cigars). When I went to pay, I was told that the combo is not valid with the Groupon. She told me she could charge for the side of fries separately, until I told her to charge the combo separately because the side of fries was $4.00 + change whereas the combo upgrade was $2 + change. She also charged me $.50 for olives on my salad, and $.50 for chickpeas even though the guy said it was free. Also $.50 for tzatziki sauce. They seriously nickel and dime you here. We got a soda cup which came with the combo, but their soda machine doesn't offer water... They do however, have a fridge full of bottled drinks that DOES include water... They also do not freely give out napkins, so you have to wait until someone is available if you want more than the 1 they gave you... It seems like very very cheap management happening in this establishment. \n\nThe food was alright. The salad mix came pre-mixed and was very very wet. I like being able to control the amount of dressing on my salad, but overall, the flavors were very fresh and the chicken was alright. My husband's wrap was better than mine which was layered with hummus, their salad mix, and steak. He did not love it however. I enjoyed the couple of bites I took but didn't want the carb bomb that came with the 16\"" tortilla. The falafel and hummus were tasty and a generous serving for the price. Lastly, when I ordered the baklava, the girl told me that the cigars have no nuts and only cinnamon. I was confused as to how that could be a baklava, but took her word on it because my son is allergic to peanuts and they were unable to answer \""Do these have peanuts?\"" We were later told that they do have nuts in them, although uncertain as to what kind, plus the cinnamon. Whatever. We just got some. There was no honey on them which made the filo dry, but the nut mix inside was yummy. There is just SUCH better baklava other places in town (Manan Bakery!). \n\nOverall, we'll be passing on another visit to Parsley. I think the food looks better than it tastes."
11475,4,"I've tried many restaurants and buffets in Las Vegas, this is definitely the best restaurant!  The food is superb and the service is excellent.\n\nTwo years ago I came here with my boyfriend, his cousin and his cousin's girlfriend whom we were staying with.  Two years ago we fell in love with Sedona and our infatuation with their food is still going on head strong.  Ever since that first visit, we've been dreaming about coming back here, usually with salivating mouths.  And now after two years, we are finally reunited.\n\nWe came on a Sunday night, and we ordered the calamari, ahi tuna lettuce wraps, and mussels for appetizers.  I have never seen calamari cut so generously.  The calamari is breaded to perfection, and it is not one bit chewy.  My boyfriend has always been wary of calamari because of its texture, but Sedona's calamari has transformed him into a believer!  The mussels and ahi tuna lettuce wraps are delicious as well.\n\nI ordered the ribeye steak with shrimp and my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon with scallops.  The ribeye steak was incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Along with the steak, there were 5 huge shrimps which were very succulent.  My boyfriend's filet mignon was cooked very well, and the scallops were orgasmic and cooked to perfection.  I've never seen scallops so big before!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the white chocolate and blueberry (?) bread pudding and the creme brulee.  Both were deliciously amazing!  Honestly, ordering creme brulee at any other restaurant feels like a waste because Sedona just makes it perfectly.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Vegas so I can eat here again.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  No restaurant on the strip will ever compare to this."

Service is pretty good; especially the sisters who work the floor and have been there since Day 1...very sweet women and always take care of all your needs...leave 'em a buck or two, they work hard!   \n\nYeah, parking is a pain if you eat right at high noon or between 5 and 7pm.  I often stop on my way home from the gym and pick up take away food; much easier.  \n\nEverything I have tried on the menu is just great. Really love their Thai Chicken and their Thai Coconut Curry ... my fave main dishes.  All 3 salads are great, and the Chopped Chicken Salad is actually way healthy when I'm watching my diet.  They just came out with some small plates; my man tried the chicken lemongrass salad small plate last night and it was really awesome.  They have a good test kitchen to come up with this stuff.  \n\nAnd I know it makes me sound like an idiot, but the really cool Coke dispensing machine is the bomb.  I usually just have the Lemonade Lite, but wow...6 flavors!   haha.   good stuff."
32074,2,"This was my second tapas place to visit in Las Vegas. \n\nThe food was ok, nothing really stood out other than the paella. It was a 40 minute wait, but worth it to try at least once!\n\nThe service was top notch, from the moment you walk thru the entrance to the wait staff, manager, everyone made you feel welcome. \n\nThe price, OH THE PRICE!   Only complaint I would say.  The entire menu is seriously over priced, even by Las Vegas Strip standards. It's the reason it will not be coming back. There are far better places to go for tapas on the Vegas strip for a better price & value. And important a better selection.\n\nThe atmosphere is great!  Plenty of light, open, not stuff. It has a bar area as well. The noise level is on the average. And the place is clean, they did a pretty good job clearing the table as you was done.  \n\nAll in all, I thought this place was OK at best.  But there are much much better places to visit."
41630,2,"I went on a hip hop night and not  much hip hop was played. However, it was still a good time there."
10193,3,Place is nice. Food is good. Ordered the roasted half chicken. It was superb.  It had a crunchy skin and was well spiced. Bartender was a good wine selector. Service was well oriented. 4 stars due to a higher price.
31112,1,"A friend and I sat at the bar for lunch. We had the baja tacos. 3 battered tacos with rice and black beans. The tacos were very good- the flour tortilla seemed home made. Overall, we were fairly impressed with the food. It is the service that left us unimpressed. The girl behind the bar was more interested in talking to her friends than serving us.  I had to flag her down, first, to get a menu, and then to order, and then to get a refill on my empty ice tea. After I asked her for an ice tea refill, she then actually went back over to the guy she was talking to and actually\nfinished her story - before getting the refill.  She tried to force a couple smiles to save things once she knew we were not happy with her service, but mostly acted like she wanted no part of being there. We were finished, and then waited at least 10 minutes for her finally to ask if we needed our ticket. Then she gave us the wrong ticket.... These type of people do not belong as the main bartender - they can definitely ruin your business.  Tacos and 2 ice teas with tip (which honestly she did not deserve) was $40. Next time, I will go to Rubio's..."
11553,3,"About a 4.5 or so... I went to DeLuca's because I saw it on MvF and I was in the area for a baseball game. I wound up getting the 2 pound breakfast burrito with bacon - I must say, I highly recommend it. The bacon at DeLuca's is VERY good, and every bit of the burrito was great. $10 may seem pretty pricey, but you get two pounds of it, and it will certainly fill you up for awhile."
2000,0,"So ..according to The Sewers of New York, this was 75.00 dollars worth of food?!?! The food was edible and the service was sub par at best, and to top it off when we advised them of our displeasure, they didn't offer to make it right. Thank goodness we still have several days of our family reunion left!"
5908,3,"D & A's is my go-to place for ice cream in Oakland.  Although it's not the best ice cream I've ever had, they have the best regular non soft-serve ice cream I've had in PGH to date.  Like other reviewers, I definitely recommend getting the waffle cone--it's delightfully crunchy, light, and sweet, not to mention freshly-made.\n\nIn terms of flavors, I'd recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough and the birthday cake.  I wouldn't call myself a huge cookie dough ice cream fan, but I really enjoyed their version, due to the high cookie dough: ice cream ratio.  I was skeptical about the birthday cake flavor, but I tried it out of curiosity, and it was great!  It has sprinkles, frosting, and cake all mixed together.  Try a sample if you're uncertain (that's what I did), but I think you'll like it! 4.5 stars."
15908,1,"I would give this place 2.5 stars.\nThere was nothing really terrible about kofusion but there wasn't anything that great about it either!\nAtmosphere- fine. A little sparkly for my taste but whatever. It was busy, otherwise sitting outside on the patio would have been much nicer.\nService- I know it was busy but the service was a mess. The food came out really fast but none of us had chopsticks, or soy sauce, or ginger, or wasabi, and they were about to just leave us! Not to mention trying to get a drink!\nFood- pretty bland and mushy with a couple good standouts on my sampler plate. I swear, one of the bad ones must have been the bologna of the sea because it looked/tasted like a hunk of spam stuffed into a roll form topped with some sauce. I spit that one out. \nThere were a couple good pieces that after I try every other sushi restaurant in C-U I might come back for."
7583,4,"it's apparent that this place use to be a bank, but after stepping inside you don't even notice you just stepped into a bank. it's like you just stepped inside a restaurant in italy. haha not really but the feeling takes over.\n\nthe service was great!! they were so nice and very knowledgeable. when i was there one of the servers dumped a whole tray of drink on to this customer's table. the customers were understandable about the whole situation. her co-workers helped her out and didn't leave her hangin', that's always nice....\n\nthe food was great!! it was VERY good!! i had the Veal with Lemon and Artichoke YUMMMMY!!! and my sister had the Cataloni that was heavenly good!\n\ni'll post pics later, but that place was really good. i would so go back there for dinner.\n\nWAY TO GO RIGATONY'S!!!!"
16221,3,"i got the famous andys sage benedict.  it was a little on the bland side, but because the portions are so big and the presentation really makes the atmosphere fun and exciting ill be going back for more.."
25706,3,"Maybe it's because I've heard so many grand things about this hotel, that my expectations were raised a tad bit too high.   I would say it's above average 3 and 1/2 stars, but not blow your socks off fantastic.  The exterior looks like a big grey block, not too exciting.  When you walk in, the hotel lobby is fairly modest, once again, nice...but nothing to rave about.   When we checked into the room, it's a nicely done average room.  The bathroom was pretty small, but then again very clean, so no complaints there.   Indoor pool was pretty small as well, but sufficient.  All in all, hotel and it's amenities were pleasant but blah.   Now the one thing that makes this hotel all worth it?  Location, location, location.  It's right above the train station, with easy access to the Metro down below, as well as straight access to the Underground City.   If you want to ride topside, there's a bus stop right at the corner of the church outside the hotel.   You could go anywhere you want, the public transportation is very very good.  It's also walkable distance to Old Montreal, it's a bit far but not too bad either.  If you get a good rate, I would recommend staying here.   Hotel personnel were also very attentive.  All in all - a pretty solid experience, but definitely NOT a top of the line luxury hotel."
20375,2,"At La Quinta, no matter where it is located, I have always had a consistently good experience. The rooms are nothing special, but they usually check off our major needs list when we are on a road trip:\n\nDoes it have a clean bed? Check.\nDoes it have a hot shower? Check.\nIs it affordable? Check.\nIs it going to be located in the city/town we are stopping in? Check.\nCan they accomodate last minute reservations? Check.\nDo they allow slightly overweight, gas-y, lazy, flat-faced, wrinkly guests? Check.\n\nSo, I got myself a rewards card and now, no matter where we travel we stay here. Honestly, I was pretty bummed we had to stay here on our trip through Vegas, though. We had our dog with us so it severly limited the places we could stay in and afford on our trip. (By the way, that slightly overweight, gas-y, lazy, flat-faced, wrinkly guest I was speaking of earlier was my English Bulldog, not my husband. I just want to clarify so I don't get in trouble later!) I was surprised to find that there were a few hotels on the strip that did allow dogs. I have never seen them on the strip or in any hotel/casino, so I just assumed they weren't. But, I was shocked to see that it is considered an upgrade to stay in a dog-friendly room and therefore the price practically doubled per night! \n\nBut no fear, the La Quinta saved the day! They even offered a free shuttle that takes you to Harrah's on the strip so you don't have to keep taking a cab back and forth. It will also pick you up from Harrah's at the end of the night if you just call and wait for it outside by the taxi call. This made having to stay here all the more enjoyable and tolerable. I mean, who seriously wants to stay in some ho-hum hotel off the strip when you are in Vegas?! Not this girl!"
30953,2,"Hello friends\n\nI thought I'd written a review but I guess not. This time the \""New York\"" pizza wasn't so \""New Yorky\"" to me. There was no way I could fold the pizza the way i could with other \""New York\"" pizza. It was pretty crowded. I like this place. Just caught em in a \""Non New York pizza day\"" I guess. \n\nI'll go back\n\nTTFN"
29232,3,"I like this place. The coffees are good and the food is tasty.  Probably the food isn't as good as the ambiance of the place, it just a has a real cool vibe to it so who cares?\n\nParking is usually a problem but the staff is very warm and friendly."
49789,0,NFL football on and I'm listening to Casey Kasum tip hits from 1978. What is the target demographic? This isn't the only time I left due to terrible ambiance. I'll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings. I hope they will find an identity.
14040,0,"I have to say this is the worst $150 we spent in our entire life. The show may be good in early 2000s, but can't make me excited in 2013. Any circus show on Asian TV programs may be better than this. Sorry I just don't get it."
41651,2,"We've been here 3 times, and the food is generally salty. It's good, but it's salty. If you like your food on the salter side, you will like it. The service is pretty great considering it's an Asian place. No one is screaming at you or giving you a look of death when you refuse a dish. None the less, I prefer Ping Pang Pong over KJ."
24921,2,"The burgers were okay. They were a little bit on the drier side. The burgers are a pretty good size. You can get a burger combo, with a side and alcoholic shake.  The shake was pretty good.  \n\nAll in all, the burger isn't anything crazy special, there are better burger places on the strip."
20320,1,"First of all you can't beat the view of the lake and the atmosphere, very romantic and peaceful if you sit outside. We went there Saturday night, they had misters outside which were nice but they soaked my husband cause they were on so high facing in his direction. Our table ordered a ton of small plates. Honestly, nothing was amazing. I wouldn't go back because there wasn't much flavor, the staff wasn't friendly either. Good drink selection so maybe it would be a nice place to have a drink and a desert. We spent about $200 for small plates and drinks. We ordered two different types of sliders, peppers, empanada, truffle mac and cheese, bacon dates, spicy tenders and spicy fries and some salads. We usually love tapas but not here."
9015,3,Love it here!!! Must try their hot & chunky salsa! But you have to ask for it ;) taco's rock!!!
10618,3,"CPK BABY!\n\nOk so I have been going to CPK for years back when I was living in los angeles, san fernando valley. A huge fan, the service is always good and the food is like no other. They are often immitated but never duplicated! A few of my faves are as follows:\n\nThe Original BBQ Chicken Chopped\nChopped lettuce, black beans, sweet corn, jicama, cilantro, basil, crispy corn tortilla strips and Monterey Jack cheese tossed together in our herb ranch dressing. Topped with chopped BBQ chicken breast, diced tomatoes and green onions.\n\nChicken Tequila Fettuccine\nThe original! Spinach fettuccine with chicken, red, green & yellow peppers, red onions and fresh cilantro in a tequila-lime and jalape\u00f1o cream sauce. \n\nKung Pao Spaghetti w/SHRIMP!\nA classic Kung Pao sauce with garlic, green onions, peanuts and HOT red chilies. Also available with chicken, shrimp or chicken & shrimp.\n\nThe Original BBQ Chicken\nOur most popular pizza, introduced in our first restaurant in Beverly Hills in 1985. Barbecue sauce, smoked Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses, BBQ Chicken, sliced red onions and cilantro.\n\nB.L.T.\nIf you like a BLT sandwich, you'll love this! Applewood smoked bacon and Mozzarella cheese, hearth baked, then topped with fresh sliced Roma tomatoes and chilled chopped lettuce tossed in mayonnaise. Recommended on honey-wheat dough. \n\n\nMargherita\nTHIN CRUST PIZZA: The classic Italian pizza. Made with imported Italian tomatoes, Mozzarella and fresh Mozzarella cheeses topped with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.\n\nSpinach Artichoke Dip\nServed hot with blue & white corn tortilla chips. \n\n\nTortilla Spring Rolls\nBAJA CHICKEN Grilled chicken breast, Jack and Cheddar cheeses, roasted corn, black beans, fire-roasted mild chilies, red onions and cilantro topped with Parmesan cheese.

Served with Thai peanut sauce.\n\nKey Lime Pie\nMade with Florida Key limes on a graham cracker crust. Served with fresh whipped cream."
41840,4,"I work right across the street from Antonio's Salon & Barber Shop and have been coming to him for over a year and a half!  He is absolutely fantastic.  He knows exactly what I like and the style of haircut I am picturing.  He is very professional with his work, reasonable with his prices, and gives a specialized haircut exactly to the T!  I rate him 5 stars."
18724,2,I always prefer to support the local businesses but Subway is better.
38698,3,"La Panth\u00e8re Verte is one of my favorite vegan place. It's delicious, good service and cool ambiance! The \""no socks\"" table by the window is really cool for a group of four with his low table and cushions. I highly recommend the Falafel fusion sandwich and cold sweet potatoes salad. They also have a variety of cold meal to take home (no tried yet tho). \n\nI recommend this restaurant for any person who's interested to try vegan food for the first time but you might find the menu a bit short on choice but hey! for a first time is good enough :)"
4411,1,"It started out really well. Was seated in less than 10 minutes and our server started out great, but it went downhill from there. \nThe food was great but they forgot our appetizer. Trying to find our server was impossible. Had to keep asking for refills n they forgot to bring out the dessert for my friends bday. When it came to paying the check....once again had to find the server. Keep in mind it wasn't that busy.  Got the busboy to finally take our check. Maybe ill just try another location."
46070,3,Everything on this menu is awesome! The cucumber salad I highly recommend!!
18444,3,"This place has the BEST breakfast sandwiches in town.  I come here all he time when i want a filling/healthy/delicious breakfast.  If you don;t want anything that heavy i am also a fan of their low carb breakfast...Their dinner pasta bowl is also really good-i'm not the biggest fan of their lunch though, not that it isn't good, it's just that i expected it to match how much i love their breakfast-but you might have a different taste.  The other reason this isn't a 5star rating is also because they can take a long time.  Most of the time it's fine because they are making it from scratch but sometimes it goes over average and when that happens you would think it would be better than the last time but they aren't the most consistent. \nPlease-go here for breakfast and try it, it's a great neighborhood coffee place."
16131,4,"man, i wish this place wasn't all the way in gilbert. it is so beyond good food, i can't explain it.\n\nthey've moved from the mesa location after like 20 years or something, and their customers followed.\n\nit's mediterranean style that is best described as a fusion of Greek (lots of kalamata olives, capers, feta, gyro meat), MIddle Eastern (a yogurt sauce similar to tsaziki, pita sandwiches) and italian (pastas, seafood) and it's all served in huge portions.\n\nbe warned, the owner/chef will not, under any cirsumstances, take changes or substitutions to any dish. trust me, i worked here, he' snot kidding, and you'll only piss of your server and the owner for pressing for it.\n\nthe rest. also includes a coffee bar/fresh dessert bar, and the cakes and tarts and pies are made in house, fresh daily. i recommend the baklava cheescake, to die for. dishes range in price from $6 for a sandwich (pita, and even burgers) to $18 for the pasta dinner dishes. whatever you get it's worth it! they also do wine pairing dinners for like $40 a person.\n\nthis place is unique and the food is fantastic.they have a ton of wines and lots of import beers and a full bar. would def make a good date place."
38602,3,"Instead of a long wait next door, I decided to try Waffallonia for the first time.  I ordered the waffle with Nutella, bananas, and strawberries.  At first the serving size of one waffle looked a bit small for my appetite.  However, joke was on me as I started digging more and more into this brunch.  The waffle was very filling and so good.  There were sugary bites that reminded me of a funnel cake.  The fruit was fresh and everything tasted great mixed together.  I am happy there was a wait next door which prompted me to try this as it was very worth it.  The atmosphere was cozy as well as the few seats inside were pressed up against a tiny counter.  Waffallonia was a cool place with fantastic waffles."
12509,1,"MONTE CARLO, an awesome name brand.We asked for a non-smoking room and we were sent into a SMOKING ROOM.I noticed that the carpet floor near the window had a minor crack.The room was NOT clean.The hotel was not nice because it is old.I will never stay in this hotel again and this hotel made me wonder why MGM Mirage made horrible hotels and never keep the old ones clean for there customers.Also,MGM's customer service need improvements.Stay at the Monte Carlo if you want a bad stay and want a feel of BARFED OUT EUROPE.This hotel is Sub-standard and below average.\n\n\nMonte Carlo,a great name,and a great disappointment."
26775,1,"As much as I want to love this local restaurant, I just don't.  The staff is wonderful, great selection of drinks, but the food is just...eh.  The American Potato Chips are delicious as are the fries.  But when you venture past that, it gets hit or miss.  The Garlic Chicken Pasta was so greasy I could hardly eat it.  The Classic Philly is great, but the French Dip is (according to my hubby) really doesn't have much taste. \n\nWe'll try again, hoping that they've worked the kinks out of the place."
20446,3,"Any respectable Italian restaurant makes their own pasta and The Pasta Shop is no exception. When the pasta is fresh, it is meant to be the focus of the dish and the linguine with clams that I ordered was a great way to really enjoy the pasta: linguine with a simple and delicious butter and clam juice sauce. It came with plenty of clams and had the perfect amount of crushed red pepper flakes to give it some spice. My only complaint with the dish was that the clams could have used a little more rinsing. \n\nThe basic Caesar salad that came with dinner was lacking. The two croutons on the plate were unpleasant in taste and texture and the lettuce was not picked through thoroughly. The little pieces of garlic bread were tasty.\n\n It is a little more expensive than your average Italian restaurant, but I consider it a premium for freshly made pasta. Not too many places make their own pasta anymore and The Pasta Shop does make some of the best."
24334,4,"Thanks to the friendly and helpful staff our stay was amazing! From the valet upon check-in to the girls in the Rojo lounge bar in the lobby! They really made us feel like special guests! Valet guy even remembered my name when we came back down to get a cab. Very impressive and I would definitely return for another relaxing stay. Didn't mind being away from the strip cause after being to Vegas so many times we don't really go walking around there as often. Room was modern and fully stocked, shower and tub were relaxing!"
7048,4,"A must-stop over when you're in the Phoenix area. Best southern food i've ever had! Far better than Roscoe's hands down. Their fried chicken is nicely seasoned. Not too much batter so when you bite into it, you're getting the right amount of crunch without the doughy taste. And it's juicy too! Even the breast. Their house made hot sauce is perfect on everything. I also ordered the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were soft and fluffy and the gravy was legit too! And the service we got was really good. Def coming back when i get another chance."
39367,1,No where close to chipotle. Threw half my veggie Burrito away. Perhaps meat stuff or salads are better. Not going back for sure.
17521,3,Excellent pulled pork sandwich! 100% pork -no fat! Also very nice French fries. My husband had an Amana blue cheese burger and he loved it also.
46909,4,"I think I'm in love! If you happen to like shakes or are in need of some fuel post workout (LVAC Flamingo & 215) check this place out. There's something for everyone...fatty, guilty pleasure shakes & fantastic healthy shakes! I got the Incredible Hulk, which is kale, pineapple & banana (I added some protein powder) and it was sooooo good! The people are are incredibly friendly & they also donate to Three Square, which helps feed children in Southern Nevada. Good product, good people & a good cause...I will be back for sure!"
29888,1,Tater tots and cheese with pretzel are great. But since the management change and name changes wow has the quality gone downhill. Live in the neighborhood and all this is good for now is a beer and watching football. The food and service just is so disappointing.
34918,4,"This place makes the best latte I've ever had. I miss it so much after I graduated. Hot/iced latte, macchiato, berry tart, sfogliatelle are my favorite~"
41755,3,"I have came here a few times and I think it's time to have an overall opinion of this place.\n\nFood 4 stars\nThey just made some changes to the menu, which is quite extensive for a BBQ joint.  Their wings are among my favorites (if not THE favorite). They are big and meaty and grilled. And even better, 6 for $5 (or 50 cents each on late night bar menu). Buffalo was good but I like the chipotle apricot best.  The chili is different; it was made with chunk of meats... More sweet than savory but still awesome for a cold night. The bacon devil eggs are easy to be consumed: open mouth, pop one in.  They can fill it up a little more but it is an appetizer. And the newest addition to the app menu is the giant hush puppies.  And they are good... Honey butter makes it even better. \nThe kitchen that started Macs is behind this joint.  While I was never a big fan of macs, I am pleased by this place.  Their smoked chicken is moist (I had dark meat). Brisket is a thick slice type.  My only suggestion is for the sauce to be toned down a little since they do have sauces to be used at table.  Some side items are lacking in the wow factor, but then I am a tough judge on Mac and cheese (and onion rings were a little bland too). I do LOVE the corn, which tastes even better the next day.  \n\nService 3 stars\nWhile I never had bad services here, I find the waitresses to be a little lacking in enthusiasm. On my first visit I was asking for input on what to order, which I think for a newer joint like this, a convincing (and honest) suggestion from the wait staff can go a long way.  Same with beer suggestion. People, this place has a beer selection!  Again, the bartender has always been ok, but an extra wow factor can make a difference. \n\nLocation/Atmosphere 3.5 stars\nThis used to be levacchia. Inside space arrangement hasnt changed much. Making it a little nicer and bigger than what you think a BBQ joint should be.  It is huge frankly.  It is right next to the light rail stop.  They validate parking which is great for arena events. \n\nA little disclaimer: I met the owners, who invited a few people to taste the new menu.  Is my review skewed because of it.  Never. But I learned a few things about the place and felt the heart they put into everything.  And it makes me want to see this place strives. I mean, they actually promise they will always have the Panthers games on, with volume!\n\nCome and try them out.\nBudget conscious alert: 3 words. LATE NIGHT MENU. 2 more words. DRINK SPECIALS. After 9 or 9:30pm. I know y'all are not in bed yet.  Oh wait, 2 more words. FREE PARKING!"
14991,1,I think this buffet has a great selection but i can't give it 3 stars because I think PH's buffet is superior. Everyone should definitely take part in the buffet of buffets and find your way here. tons of great food and selection among plenty of buffets to choose from.\n\nA perk to going to this buffet is that it's easier to get to than PH and it's closer to all the action. Finish up here and you can head right on over to the parties! not recommended partying in vegas on a super full stomach though. You'll need the room ;-)
36247,2,"We decided to try Cafe Provance on a Monday night and we were hesitant because we had our 2 year old with us. But we fidgured we would go ahead and try the casual dining side. We peeked into the fine dining side, not really my thing. Seemed a little stuffy, plus the prices are a lot higher. Plus, the casual dining side has tvs, and it was Monday Night Football, so that was a huge bonus for my husband.\nWe started off with the calamari appetizer and the french onion soup. Both were good, and the lemony sauce with tomatoes that the calamari came in was sooooo good. My husband got the steak sandwich and fries, I got the talapia with smashed potatoes and carrots. Same as the appetizers, good, but not amazing. I do think mine was better than my husbands, the fish was cooked really well. I also thought the potatoes and carrots were yummy. Service was great and i like the overall atmosphere. We will for sure go back, mainly because there is just not a ton of options in Anthem and everything was pretty good."
24086,1,"The first time I went to Sauce, I had a sandwich, and I really liked it. I also really liked the retro decor of the place. It was different and seemed non-chain-like (whatever that means). The second time I went to Sauce, I had their pepperoni pizza, and it was, eh, okay. Nothing special...at...all. It was greasy and there was too much cheese for the thin crust to hold up so the slices were kinda limp when you picked them up. I've had better pizza from places like Ray's Pizza and Sardellas for a much more reasonable price. \n\nThe biggest problem I had with this second visit was that a few minutes after we sat down, they brought out my Mom's sandwich, but didn't bring out the pizza until probably 15 or 20 minutes later. H-E-L-L-O?! My Mom was already halfway done with her sandwich. We ordered them all together, so why didn't they bring the entire order out at the same time? That is a very bad way to serve food.  But, I do have to give them a little props because the manager came out with the pizza and apologized for it taking so long.  \n\nI think Sauce is pretty much overrated. The decor and look of the restaurant is kinda cool, but they need to work on their pizzas. I'll probably go back, but only for their sandwiches from now on."
12718,1,"I'm not saying that this is a horrible place to stay, however, there were a few drawbacks that made me NOT want to put this on my priority list of places to stay again.  We paid a little extra for the west wing rooms which claimed to be updated and nicer than the grand tower rooms.  I've stayed in the grand tower rooms before and thought they were pretty nice but I decided to check these rooms out this time.  Although, they are more modern, they are way smaller and the bathrooms lack any privacy.  I also hurt my toe on the stupid \""modern\"" door that closes off the toilet.  \nPOSITIVES:\n-Not too expensive\n-Pools are awesome!\n-Won BIG in casino\n-Maids and Room service staff were extremely helpful and courteous!\n-Bar tenders and waitresses in the West Wing bar/lobby were so nice and fun!!\n-Some of the restaurants were pretty good and not to pricey\n\nNEGATIVES:\n-Front desk staff at check in were rude! (the lady that helped us was rushing to get out of there or something)\n-The MGM is huge!  It felt like we walked a mile to get to our room\n-The lamp in our room would randomly turn on and off which scared me to death the first time it happened!\n-There are not very many channels on the TV(I know, I know who needs the TV when you're in Vegas?  I do, it helps me go to sleep)\n-A few of the dealers and pit bosses were horribly RUDE!!  Even though I won money in that casino, they made me never want to gamble in that casino again.\n-At check out, the front desk staff was once again extremely RUDE!!!!! Bad way to end our trip\n\nOverall, the front desk staff is horrible!!!!!!!!!  The same goes for a few of the dealers and pit bosses.  Decently priced hotel but don't pay extra for the west wing room, it's not worth it."
41017,1,"Waited 45 minutes for a salad? Our server didn't check on us and we had little ones with us. The kitchen was backed up... It is a restaurant right, it's what you do? \nToo bad, we have given this place a chance and every time the service is lacking. Go when you have plenty of time and aren't hungry, it takes a long time to get your food."
43614,2,"Came here last Friday night based upon the Yelp reviews and it was convenient. We got the large AC special pizza for $18.95. The toppings were green bell peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni. The sausage was round and thinly sliced like pepperoni is. The portion of sauce was okay, not skimpy but not overly generous. The sauce had a slightly sweet flavor to me, which I didn't prefer. Tasted home mad though but still doesn't necessarily mean it is excellent merely because it is home made. \n\nWe took it home so I can't judge whether the crust was crispy or not - we heated it back up when we got home prior to eating on a pizza stone so the crust was crispy. So overall decent thin crust pizza, not on par with Lombardi's in NYC or such but decent. I am a thick crust girl but as thin crust goes I prefer the thin crust (and thick crust) over at Dom Demarco and I personally think that is more \""authentic\"". The caveat being I am not from NY but I have ate my way through it.  \n\nI think the price is a little steep for what you are getting but I am glad I tried something new. I wasn't thrilled with the ambience in the restaurant, that was the deciding factor in taking it home. They tried to make it a warm, fresh venue with the paint and decor, however, the acoustics were poor and although there were only a few people in the restaurant it seemed loud."
45873,1,"It looks cool in the reviews but the over look is very cafeie, the drink are nice but unless its happy hour they are over priced for a mimosas and some wines, the food is worth it not bad considering the area caters to tourist and the \""Ogden\"" residents"
12118,1,"Decent Chinese for the money, its not spectacular, but it is good, especially the Sesame Chicken and the Shrimp Lo Mien.  The food is a little greasy, but the portions are big and the rice is good. There are definitely better quality Chinese restaurants in Charlotte, but if you're in the University area and needing some Chinese, this place will scratch the itch."
18880,0,"I recently purchased trail mix from the bins in the front of the store. I Brought it home and put it in a sealed container. A week later tiny cockroaches filled the container. Frozen foods seem as if they've been thawed and then refrozen. The guy behind the deli counter is rude and always behaves as if he is annoyed by his customers. My family was hanging in there hoping most of this was a fluke,  but the cockroaches put us over the edge. When we called to inform the manager she did not apologize and just offered a refund. How about a notice to all of you customers that you've sold them cockroach eggs?"
49497,2,"I can only give this place 3 stars because of the staff.  They were all so super nice and very down to earth.  Sampled five drinks from friends being the DD and all,  didn't really like any of them except the frozen mojito and even that one was a little too sweet don't think I could drink a whole one.  They did say it was the most popular drink.\n\nThe peppers off the HH menu were surprisingly good.  Chx tacos way too small. I mean tiniest portions there all together.  The $18 tuna ceviche came out and there was hardly anything to it plus it wasn't good at all.  I did eat it though because I didn't want to waste $18 ceviche but really wish I would have sent it back.  Great presentation on it.  The guacamole was good but nothing special. They do only give u 5 chips to eat it and when u ask for more they charge u.  \nAll in all. I've heard rave reviews about this place and all of us agreed it's not worth it to go back.  Sorry sumo! :("
24176,2,"My first visit to SWINA was an accident- I had an appt. for a massage at SWIHA and mistakenly turned into the parking lot next door.  The second time was when reparations at SWIHA caused them to close shop and move all appointments (including my massage) here.  I was not able to enjoy the massage as much, bec. the open ceilings allowed all sorts of noises (conversations, construction noises coming from next door, etc.) in- too distracting.\n\nI was able to experience my first mud wrap after first reading about SWINA's offering back in June '08 last Friday.  I'd have to say it was nothing I thought it would be.  I thought I'd be lying in a bed of mud (like I've seen in European travel logs) w/ some slices of fruit or veggies covering my eyes (no, not cucumber slices... I'm allergic to cukes!).  Nope.  No mud bed.  No sliced garnishes placed on the windows of my soul.  However, I did get two women to simultaneously massage my back (Cassie) and leg muscles (Patty)!!  Woah!  So this is what tandem massages are all about!!  I asked if this was standard practice here in SWINA, 'cause if it is, I could definitely get used to this!  But no, I'm told that I got lucky that day, w/ students' schedules opening up at just the right moment to allow me this extra luxury.  (If you ask me, I think it's a ploy to get newbies to come back for treatments week after week!)\n\nBut let's backtrack a bit and start in the beginning.  After stripping down to my comfort level (topless), and lying face down on the massage table (I requested a face pillow for more comfort), Cassie and Patty proceeded to give me the back and leg massages.  Afterwards, they employed natural brushes over exposed areas for an all-over exfoliation.  The sensations ranged from slightly ticklish to soothing (you may tailor the pressure exerted).  I was asked to flip over onto my back, and soon after, the mud was then painted on by both women with another set of brushes.  This was when the treatment started to go downhill for me... the mud was applied cold, and thank goodness there was a heat lamp nearby to keep me warm.  After painting my back, arms, legs, and abs, the two women proceeded to wrap plastic around my extremities and then again w/ another wrap that was already laid on top of the massage table under me.  (If you suffer from claustrophobia, body wraps are not for you!)  Patty then left Cassie to help another student.  Cassie then proceeded to give me my second favorite part of the treatment, which is a head and neck massage.  Nice!!  After, Cassie offered to give me something complimentary- a facial massage!  Would I want one?  Why, yes, thank you very much!  After all that pampering, we were now at the point where I again had to endure chills while Cassie wiped off the mud w/ warm towels.  But I requested hotter towels, as in steaming hot!, and poor Cassie... her hands were burning!, but she did what I requested, and I was able to stave off the chills for awhile.  To \""wrap\"" things up, Cassie followed up w/ a hypoallergenic Lotus Touch lotion.  \n\nMy skin felt supple, but nothing different than what I'd experience after a bath at home using Aveda Soothing Therapy salts.  On the whole, the experience was good, but most of it is bec. of Cassie's bedside manner.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask for her again.  However, I don't think I'd try another wrap- SWINA offers three: mud, seaweed, and herbal- since I'd rather not get chilled, plus the plastic wraps used aren't biodegradeable, so I'd feel guilty causing all that pollution!  I'd say that the tandem, head, neck, and facial massages were my favorite parts, and for that, I'll just stick w/ SWIHA.  I will be back to try other services (hour-long facials for $30, anyone?)."
30970,0,"So, I paid extra to have a package delivered same-day via Amazon. I get home from work at about 3:30 and wait for my package. 6 o'clock rolls around, I check the delivery status, and it shows me \""delivery attempted\"" at 4:03. What? I was home, literally next to the door and never heard a knock.\n\nI called down to the main office and they tell me he had no gate code. They have my phone number, why couldn't he have called me? They say they do not supply drivers with cell phones. Even without a gate code, the gate is right next to the office that he could've dropped it off at! This all happens on a Friday, lucky me they don't deliver on weekends so now I'm stuck waiting either waiting until Monday for my package or going to their office and picking it up myself. Joy...\n\nUpdate: So I called back to find out when I could pick up my package, the woman I spoke to said her coworker has to call the driver to find out when he will return. They don't supply their employees with cell phones, remember? Anyway, she said she would get back to me. \n\nI got a call back within a 1/2 hour and she said the driver won't be back at the office until 9 o'clock that night, and they'll be closed. My package will be available on Monday, and guess what, now I HAVE to pick the package up. This is unbelievable. BBB here I come..."
4785,1,"Went in for a meal on Sunday night.  Not a great move.  The food was really not great even for a chain italian place.  Service was good, we sat at the bar to watch the Sunday night game.  \n\nI'm still not sure if the issue was the poor food, the poor menu, or something I can't nail down."
7291,2,"Location: It is a bit ghetto but still centrally located.\n\nApartments: The normal 1 bedroom and multi-bedroom units are pretty standard however, the upgraded one bedroom is quite nice with a unique floor plan that I liked very much. The bedroom is tucked nicely away down a hallway from the main living area. The patio is accessible from both the bedroom and main living area. The kitchen is centrally located. The in unit washer and dryer are located right next to the spacious closet.\n\nI cannot comment on the other units but the one bedroom upgraded apartment is great.\n\nNeighbors: Neither great nor terrible in the nicer part of the apartments. It is my opinion that single people with good incomes are placed in one part of the apartments and people with children or bad incomes are placed in another but I cant say for sure it just seemed that way to me. So if you were in the nicer part the neighbors were ok. If you were in the not so nice part then the neighbors were a bit much.\n\nParking: One reserved spot but the not reserved spots are tiny and there are not enough. Have to buy your own clicker for the gate that encloses the community and it is usually in disrepair.\n\nAmenities: Pool, hot tub, free gym (Pool is in ok shape)\n\nManagement: This is where these apartments fail. The management is very friendly when you sign up but once you are in they treat you like just another apartment number. I was referred when I moved in and then they tried not to pay the referral. I fought with them for a couple weeks and they eventually paid it. My cousin lived here for years and was well aware when monthly rent was greatly reduced for new residents but they would not give him the same deal when his lease was up. \n\nAll in all it is ok because of the bad management, good single upgrade apartment layout, central location but bad neighborhood."
30061,4,"The food was outstanding, as were the drinks. The decor is simple, but cool. Service was top notch. Worth the price tag!"
968,1,"Cheap and perfectly adequate. The kind of place you order from because it's close and cheap. If you're willing to travel farther, wait longer, or spend more, go elsewhere. But this is a fine option, and you can get a lunch special with an entree and fried rice for $4.50. I like the broccoli with garlic sauce--the sauce is good but not great, but the broccoli is perfectly cooked. Mmm."
36754,1,Awww. Was so good when I was here before. Went for nice dinner. Was disappointed. Best things were the entrees. Got the pork shoulder. Good. All friti and vegetable things that were so good before but lost it now. Sugar settled in the wine. Bottle shouldn't have been served. Would recommend skipping.
31950,3,"Love their pizza! Love their salads! Very friendly staff!\n\n(The only thing I don't like is that the kids are given pizza dough to play with. It just grosses me out. I know it's fun for them, but to watch kids at other tables play with the dough, and waste food... I don't like that part about the restaurant.)"
46545,3,"Got me in the same day and turned it around very quick!  Lifetime warranty, was very happy with the service and speed."

34031,0,"I had more than one bad experience here. My first experience here the nail technician piled the acrylic on my nails so thick it was impossible to use my fingers. I had to go to another nail salon to have half the acrylic filed off and my nails reshaped because they were so big and bulky. \n\nI suppose shame on me for returning but, I did to get my eyebrows waxed. The waxing experience was pleasant and I was pleased with the outcome. The problem occurred several days later. I noticed my skin was very irritated with red bumps around my eyebrows. Apparently, the technician did not use fresh wax. \n\nI would not recommend this salon to anyone."

24322,4,"Love this place!  Great place to go safely hiking and get a workout.  But it is a trail where it is harder to come back - more uphill.  Most hikes you reach your peak and then it's all downhill from there.  Not this place :)  Great views!  Usually see Chuckwallas (lizards) and I just saw my first rattlesnake on this trail and I have probably hiked this trail 20 or more times.  If you are visiting Scottsdale, you must go, even if you just get to the peak, without heading over to the second mountain.  Fabulous!"
42525,4,I seriously love this place! I feel like 90% of my wardrobe is from here and whenever I get compliments I automatically send them here. The only thing I wish is that they would get in more smaller sizes when they order shipments because a lot of the time the smaller sizes are sold out. But other than that I love everything about this place!
10586,2,"One of the best Nordstroms that sell big high fashion brands such as Prada, Balenciaga, Burberry, Chanel, etc.  If you're a fan of Nordstrom, you know some places sell \""cheaper\"" clothing than others (if you want the Mercedes of Nordstroms, try visiting the one in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, CA!)  Huge Thanksgiving Sale, with really cute shoes.  Too bad they were still way overpriced and not within my budget."
1121,3,"I visited the convention center as part of the expo for the Rock N Roll marathon/half marathon and this review sprawls across both of these entities.\n\nAs for the convention center, it's certainly in the upper half of \""Convention Centers I have known\"". The rooms are spacious and it's easy to get up and down floors. The design is nice with easy access to the stairs and escalators and they have the exit-only designs that are conveniently located. It may not be the greatest endorsement when I say that the convention center can be quickly exited, but I appreciated these benefits.\n\nThe Rock N Roll expo was also reasonable: they have a similar set up at all their races and the number and scope of vendors is impressive. Now, I've always considered these things the equivalent of runners' porn and typically try to get out as quickly as possible. It only takes a momentary distraction to have you stop in front of a stall and decide that you must have the new Saucony socks (\""But these are ULTRA wicking!\"")\n\nI've taken the Jason Bourne in an embassy in Switzerland approach: when you walk in the entrance, you put your earpiece in, rip the diagram of the building off the wall, analyze the quickest route between the points you need to go and then march. This typically works fairly well and you can navigate through the whole affair in a few minutes. Not too shabby.\n\nA friend of mine has a different philosophy. He claims that you want to take the more circuitous route through the hall since people tend to congregate in the center of the place. He probably has a point (although I'll never admit that to him): there's actually a hierarchy of vendors and the less desirable ones tend to get stuck along the back walls. When you navigate this path, the crowds are sparser and the vendors are listlessly standing next to stalls of \""Used Running Socks\"" and \""Backwash Gatorade\"". I tried this manuever at the Phoenix expo and found that I could exit the building a little faster. An idea to try the next time you're at one of these things......"
15953,1,"A few friends and I went to AZ during spring training and I knew one of the places we had to go was Big Bang.  I emailed a few weeks before to get on the VIP list and we were all set.  I used to visit Tempe often when my sister went to ASU and we went here a few times and always had a great time.\n\nWe went out to dinner at a place across the street and had a few drinks.  After dinner we headed over to BIg Bang and retrieved our wristbands. My boyfriend and a friend walked across the street to buy some cigarettes so the rest of us headed in and got our first round of drinks and a table.  When my boyfriend and friend came back the bouncer at the door would not let him enter because he said he was too drunk. WHAT?!?!?  \n\nI asked to speak with the manager and she seemed to want to help. She spoke with the bouncer first before even speaking with my boyfriend and I to assess the situation.  When I approached her she stated that she was taking the bouncers side and would not let my boyfriend in. Again, without even talking to us or anything. It was crazy!  I kind of had the feeling that the bouncer had it out for us.  It was all so strange."
3009,3,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't too busy, unlike their weekday lunch rushes. We ordered the pad thai, pad see ew, and green curry lunch specials. The lunch specials are a really good deal, at only $8 for a large portion, salad, and egg roll! (The salad and egg roll weren't that impressive though)\n\nI really liked the flavor of the pad thai (and that it came with peanuts!), but was disappointed because the pad see ew was really over-sauced. The green curry was good, but nothing special. So I would recommend the pad thai. The staff was also very friendly, and there's a 10% discount if you pay in cash!"

11269,4,"A \""must try\"" place. The sushi is ALWAYS fresh, the service is ALWAYS fast, the chefs are ALWAYS nice and ready to recommend something.It is a little pricey comparing to other places, but definitely worth your $.\nHowever..this place is SO tiny..and if you got on a Saturday or Friday night..you would have to wait 30minutes at least to get in..but we ALWAYS wait 'cuz we'r good sushi loverz :D"
41512,0,"Wow, this place sucks. While waiting for our table, we were repeatedly ignored by the bartender. We must have appeared too we'll groomed in contrast to the rest of the patronage. \n\nWe had a party of 8. After all the food was dumped on the table, the W. Va. hick that was serving us came over to me and said, \""you must not have ordered\"", which I certainly did because, that day, I had only eaten an apple and I was starving.  I do love it when I am assigned blame for a service mistake by my waitress.  \n\nSo, at that point, I decided to forgo a meal and just have tequila - to kill the pain of listening to the insolent and aggressively poor-performing waitress and to help me better assess next steps for the evening. I ordered a shot for me and the guy next to me. She asked if I wanted salt and a lime. I said no. The shots came with salt and a lime.  Worse, I think the \""shots\"" may have been premixed margaritas without ice.  They were certainly not the Cuervo that we had requested. So, I asked for two Patron shots, which were just what the doctor ordered. \n\nAfter action assessment in brief - worst service I have had in years, maybe ever - can't even get tequila right - horrible patronage (could have been some LA5 gang members in there) - can't assess food because I was never given any, but chips were ok. \n\nRecommendation - 1) don't go - 2) if you have to go, order a shot of Patron immediately - 3) make sure you get some food \n\nThe combination of food and Patron will dull the pain."
3403,4,"I am still coming to the same Firestone years later and the same guys still work there and they are still good to me. The make sure I don't pay for services I don't need and when I do need something, they make sure it is taken care of asap and try to make sure it doesn't cost a small fortune. Even my coworkers in my office have started going to this location and they guys are good to them. Plus they know if they aren't I would give them hell, and the last thing they want is a mad Ebony on their hands lol. I trust them as they know my car is important to me. So in a nutshell, yes I still like this Firestone. The end! :)"
15377,4,"So, it's opening weekend and we have VIP passes which really generally means zip at most clubs in Vegas. Usually, it means you just get to stand in a different line or mob that usually takes about just as long. \nSo we are standing off to the side of the ropes and start talking to a security guy and make nice. We ask if he can help get us in. He says no can do but that we are in luck. Really? Why we ask. He says well see that guy right there? (He points to the main man picking people out of the crowd to go in) Yes we say. Well that guy loves two things in this world - asian women and tits, and combined you two are just that. This is perfect. My friend happens to be a lovely half japanese woman and me? I'm strategically showing off my 7k investment/christmas present and hoping to get a return on my investment. Wouldn't you know it - within 3 minutes of him saying this, we are in. Score. So a star for getting in! I know its a completely selfish reason to give a star but it was a fine moment in my Vegas memory bank. (no pun intended....actually, pun intended). \n\nOne star for kickin decor, TWO stars for a HUGE dance floor and with actual room to dance. One more star for FANTAB music with nothing lame and no repeats.\n\nTotal? Five stars for sure."
40390,2,"The Hasaki Grill is a typical fast casual style Japanese restaurant focused on Hibachi and Teriyaki style dishes.  It has the usual steak, chicken, shrimp, etc., so don't expect much originality here.  You have wait in line before giving your order and, depending if its there or to go, given a number.  The facilities are clean and very modern; though because of limited area, the tables are all joined together and could make for awkward company.\n\nThe prices for the dishes are slightly cheaper than other similar restaurants in the Uptown area.  The meal is served on actual plates, though portion size are smaller though than average.  All meals typically come with shrimp sauce and drinks are self serve.  Reasonable wait time.\n\nIn my visit, I ordered Hibachi steak with zucchini and onions instead of carrots, which was a small price addition.  Taste wise, it was okay... the sauce utilized was sweet, not expected for Hibachi.  I ate all and it was okay, but because the portion size is smaller, I was still kind of hungry.  Overall, I give it three out of five:  Very nice place and less expensive; but with lesser portions and sweet tasting Hibachi."
47157,0,"I called the local phone number located on my bill and it was answered by a person located in another state. I explained I would like to pay my HOA dues through the end of the year. The operator then informed me their fee for accepting my payment would be over $200.00. When I questioned why, she stated that was their payment fee based on the amount I was paying. OK....if we want to pay ahead we are penalized???Fee for what???Its already a HOA fee. Is this a fee for making a payment on a fee?? How stupid. I have normally paid through bill pay from same bank account and no fee and if I want to pay by phone there is a fee and if you pay on their web site there is also a fee. Not a happy resident."
3714,0,"My roommate and I had been ordering from this place for over a year.  We were incredibly loyal and encouraged all of our friends to order from Pong Pong - I know from my own records that we've given these guys hundreds of dollars in business.\n\nLast week when we were moving and completely foodless, we followed our usual routine and called Pong Pong.  The food took an hour and a half to get there (they said 30-45 mins), the delivery driver called us twice, yelled at us and then hung up both times.  When he finally got there, he WHISTLED at us to come get the food from his car and when he didn't bring one of the meals we ordered, he simply apologized and left.  My roommate ended up having to get in his car and drive to get food after waiting over an hour for Pong Pong to bring us our simple, two entree order.  Not to mention, the food I ordered with no onions or mushrooms was covered in both.\n\nThe next day I called to speak with the manager and get my money back and they refused to reimburse my card, told me they \""understood\"" that I wouldn't be giving them anymore business after trying to remedy it with 15% off my next order.\n\nAre you kidding me?  \n\nDON'T ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.  I used to stick up for them when others said their food was gross and service bad, but apparently they really don't care about maintaining a report with loyal costumers and solving problems.  I know the economy sucks and everyone is trying to hold onto their pennies, but a free meal is all they needed to keep a steady flow of business from us and our multiple friends.\n\nAt this point, I'd go to Panda Express before Pong Pong."
23028,3,"I'm saving the last star for when I actually sit and eat in the restaurant. I always get my pizza to go...the Coppa Ham & Olive is the best.  I've only had that and split a salad with someone...but I've eaten it 15+ times (why mess with perfection?!)  I crave it at least once a week.  It's a bit pricey, especially since you can't actually get two small meals out of it.  It's either one giant meal (which I can't do) or one regular meal and a snack.  The ingredients are rather pricey as well, so I don't mind the extra cost. The crust is hand tossed and sometimes comes with slightly charred bubbles in the dough.  The ingredients are incredibly fresh.  The service is really amazing (even for carry-out).  They just celebrated their one-year anniversary and I'm looking forward to many more meals there. (I peeked at their wine selection and its pretty great.)  Enjoy!"
10662,1,"I would give 5 stars for their chocolate souffle, their awesome window view overlooking towards the Bellagio fountains, and their meal service but somethings I had to consider were:\n\n1)  When I make a birthday reservation for 7:30 p.m., I expect the reservation for 7:30 p.m., not 8:15 p.m.\n2)  If I want an order of Hennessey, I'd rather get a bottle at Eddie's Liquor for $30 instead of 30mL for $24 (if you're planning on drinking a cocktail, stick to their bar during your wait or get a head start down at the casino or get hammered in your hotel before you arrive~ it'll be way more cheaper in the end!)\n3)  I'm not an expert on French cuisine, but I expect good tasting food no matter what country of origin. The sea bass was okay with a nice crisp on the skin but expected more flavor and a thicker cut ( I had better at a small hole in the wall in San Clemente, CA); the asparagus was too al dente and drenched in way too much butter for my liking (and I love butter); the mushroom side was sad and I haven't had a mushroom dish I never liked until now.\n\nThat being said, I did appreciate our attentive server and the experience of fine dining. My date's rack of lamb and creme brulee was wonderful but nothing could beat their chocolate souffle.....I almost had a relationship with it!  All in all, expect to pay for the experience, the view, and the souffle."
4860,2,"I have to say there customer service is great, however I frown upon the fact that they charge $115.00 right off the bat just to look at something that needs a repair which binds you to have the repair done there or you lose your money. I wouldnt mind paying that on a large repair but for a small repair like a broken stearing wheel lock, it can be very pricey. Not sure if I want to go back to have this done."
34100,1,"I will start by saying I love the sushi. By far the best fish in town without strip prices. Good for locals to have this quality of sushi. I have followed Young from Sapporo to Kai Sushi and now Sin City Sushi. Young is a true master sushi chef. The sauces he makes is to die for. I am a BIG FAN OF his food. and have been eating it for years.\n\nWith that said I just can't get over how bad the service is now. When they lost Stacie( front end manager) it was all down hill.  Young's wife took over the front end. her first order of business is bring in her sister.  No disrespect, but they are absolutely the worst servers I have ever come across. Its a problem ever time we eat there if she is our server . We (meaning my family) refuse to eat there if she is on the floor. tonight when we walked in she was there but we decided to eat anyway. Needless to say it was a disaster. she didn't give  us any ginger or wasbi until we had eaten most of our sushi, and yes we had to keep asking. Ordered hot tea she give me water. They give us 2 sushi rolls, we didn't order! then she argued with us insisting we did. brings back the ticket and shows us it was marked. I filled out the ticket myself and know that only one person at the table wanted a sushi roll. and that was a Stacie roll. NO ONE AT THE TABLE WANTED A HAMACHI ROLL! Then we ordered a dinner item for my son she gives us the appitizer version. We tried to tell her we wanted the dinner, she says they don't  make it. When we have eaten it more then 20 times . its all my 3 year old gets when we eat there. I think she does whatever she wants and tells custmers whatever, not knowing we know the menu by heart. even if it wasn't  she could careless about what you want!!\n\nAnyway that's my rant. Sorry if its so harsh but today was it for me. They had two great servers on the weekends a very cute Blondie and cute young gal from Hawaii. I loved these to gals. They went out of there way to serve with a smile. The blonde would always give my son a toy. To find out this was an expense she took upon herself. This gal should of been made the manager!! She was friendly fast and efficient.\n\nI walked away for a few months to see if it would get better but no changes. So we wouldn't be back for awhile. The food is great but its ruined by the long waits and bad service."
20678,3,"The cashier, Roger, took my order was super enthusiastic, helpful, & friendly. When I walked up he was offering samples & I took one expecting it to be cold with no taste, I was proved wrong. They also sell delicious smoothies as well! I was asking another employee about the different sauces in the wraps & he heard me and even hooked it up with the hot sauce! DEFINATELY COMING BACK."

30652,0,"The name says it all.  Terrible.\nI guess you pay the consequences for being cheap and stopping at the first place we drove past.  $10 for a tiny buffet with the normal free hotel food:  wet eggs, funky already made omelets, oval hashbrowns, thin bacon, and funky fruit salad.  They had a carving station with dry meat that was recommended I \""put a lot of barbecue sauce on it because it helps make it better\"" by an employee.  \nWe did get a lot of champagne.  The only good thing.  \nMy stomach was very angry at me for filling it with what this place tried to convince us was food."

21169,4,First time trying it with recommendation from one of my friend. It wasn't a disappointment. Late night all you can eat at 3AM in the morning after midnight bowling this place just hits the spot. \n\nThe service we received was awesome we we're a group of five and our server really catered to us. We ordered three of everything in the all you can eat menu and she cooked every one of them for us. My water was constantly refilled. My friends seconds/third order of rice came out quick. \n\nUltimately I'll come back and if bring another friend.
43617,1,"With all the pizza places on this particular corner, I would have expected a new place coming in to be over the top.  The margarita pizza was just sad.  Barely any cheese, made with sauce instead of fresh tomatoes, just an all around bust.  They don't have much on the menu - especially for someone gluten free.  \n\nThe wait staff was awesome."
15869,2,"I ate here on our last visit and remember having a great experience. So on our return we decided to have brunch here.\n\nThe line was enormous, with no sign or notification of how long we would be waiting. But the wafts of delicious smells and memories of a good meal kept us in line. \n\nA 50 minute wait later we were seated at a circle booth with a beautiful view of the reindeer display. \n\nWe ordered the French onion soup, Greek salad, the traditional fish and chips and a Few sides. We munched on the variety of bread while we waited which wasn't great, but we were hungry.\nThe Greek salad came out and was a large size, though the dressing wasn't great. The onion soup was delicious with a layer of gruyere cheese.\nThe best thing was the fish and chips. And being a Brit I know what in talking about. Great french fish with a plentiful of yummy french fries. \nThe saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, broccolinni and mash were also good.\nFood is good but not quite worth the long wait and the price. Though it has great ambience and great service."
2961,0,"I really don't understand what the fuss is about with this place.  I had it years ago and thought it was horrible, but decided to give it a try again today with some co-workers. What a mistake!  First off, the food is horribly overpriced.  You can get a better bowl of pho at many other Vietnamese restaurants for half the price.  Taste wise, the pho was horrible.  It's all about the broth for a good bowl of pho, and it tasted like they just used beef broth from a can.  Additionally, the brisket smelled like it was spoiled.  Even my American co-worker thought the food tasted horribly.  This is the first time I have not left a tip at a restaurant.  It was that bad.  If you go to a Vietnamese restaurant and you don't see any Vietnamese people there, it should tell you something."
23011,0,"The cupcakes were quite a let down. We spent quite a bit of money to get cupcakes for our entire group (there were 14 of us), and unfortunately the cupcakes weren't anything special. I'm a cupcake fanatic and sweet lover, so it's not like I'm not a dessert person.. because I am.  However these just didn't do it for me.  The cake was dry and lacking flavor, and the frosting wasn't enough to save the cupcake. I knew everyone else felt the same as no one finished a whole cupcake. The shop was decently cute, but smelt horribly of tobacco from the store next door.  \nIf you want a yummy cupcake, but want to avoid the strip I'd suggest Gigi's or the whole foods at town square."
5560,0,"Rude employees and disingenuous advertising.  They claim to be open 7 days a week from 7 AM to Midnight.  I had my car towed in last Saturday around 5:00 PM.  As I was leaving I asked when they would look at it and the front desk guy says they run a skeleton crew on the weekends and should get to it by Sunday morning.  I called back at 9:30 AM Sunday and spoke with the mechcanic Justin.  I asked if had looked at my car and he said no and that he may get to it that evening.  I said \""Justin the reason I brought my car to you was that your open on the weekends and I need my car back ASAP\"".  Justin's response \""listen I'll get to it when I get to it and if you can't wait then come and pick up your car\"", so I did.  I could of had my car towed to a dealer who was going to look at it Monday.    I came to Vegas for the weekend and had no plans on staying till Monday, so I thought these guys advertising they are open on the weekend could take care of my overheating car, but instead they are basically open to take your can in and work on it during the week when they have a full staff.  The salt in the wound was speaking with Justin the Mechanic he was a condescending little punk.  I was not belligerent nor rude to him I just asked him when he was going to look at my car.  \n\nObviously management has no clue or doesn't care because they either hire rejects or don't train their employees on customer service skills.  More importantly they advertise they are open on the weekend and don't staff accordingly.  AE"

Pick up time was scheduled for 10am.\n  We arrived to pick up our balloons at 10:15 and the employees were JUST starting to fill them!!!   We had to wait about 20 minutes!   I had food in my van, and other things to do to set up for this party!   Needless to say I was quite upset with the horrible service!   They didn't apologize, or offer me anything to make up for the inconvenience.  Cripes.... at least throw in a few free balloons!   AWFUL!"

6846,2,"I've only ever ordered delivery from Nam's, so I don't know how it is in person. Their food is impressive enough to make them a regular in my delivery rotation, but pricey enough that I probably won't go for them more than once a month or so. Their lemongrass chicken wings were the dish that originally sold me on the place, with their surprising and delicious flavor combination, but all the typical americanized Chinese dishes I'd get anywhere else have been at least as good if not better than other places I've tried around Madison. I get bubble tea with every order--delicious and refreshing. My favorite so far is the honeydew milk tea, but I haven't tried them all yet. I tried one of their Vietnamese sandwiches recently, and it was too spicy for my taste, but from what I could taste after picking off all the peppers and still feeling like I was martyring my mouth, it seemed like the meat had a nice texture and the sauce was good...maybe just not my thing. \n\nPersonally, my go-to takeout places are usually those that give huge portions, so I can justify the price by the fact that they give me yummy leftovers for a week...Nam's isn't like this, and it makes me sad. But it's still good enough to keep going back to, just not quite as frequently."
13128,1,"Need updating A.S.A.P\n\n\nGood old Luxor from the outside the hotel still looks good fast check in, nice bar's located around the casino floor, not as big gambling area (no prob not really a gambler), Starbucks, Mc Donald's and ease of the tram to Excalibur and Mandalay place mall that connects to Mandalay Bay hotel. One problem it is a different story when you get to your room. I stayed in the west tower last year during the Cotto vs Pacquiao fight, many of the bed room fixtures looked dated from the TV, seats and etc. I also experience the shower  in my room had major problem's and wouldn't function right so I just used the walk in shower instead. Though dated items and shower problem the room was very clean. It would not be my first choice of hotel again but if you can get a low rate go for it but don't compare this hotel to it's sister property Mandalay Bay  which I stayed before but in which it will be no contest due to being aimed at a high end market."
33539,0,"Oct 23, 2014 .this date when  I rented the car and I am very very angry and disappointed. The site was no near the Airport for one. Then the employees were not fast enough on check in and returning  that made customers wait in line for hours.  So here was my big problem. After I returned the car with full gas tank. They still charges my Visa for full tank of gas and they made a big mistakes on using other customers Visa card for crediting back my deposit of $150  I called them and I also  filed a dispute to my card company. The fox manager tried to credit me back in small increments to my Visa and  until now they haven't credit me back for the full amount after so many phone calls I made. I will just let my card company to do it for me since I am very tired and angry. If you get a cheap price you also get a cheap and annoying deals with the employees.

Sort of that \""You don't talk during a meal because it's so delicious\"" - thing?\n\nAnyway,\n\nThe owners and staff here are so freaking nice. Customer Service is such an important element to dining, that a lot of places overlook, and these folks do it well.\n\nTraditional Thai offerings in a very relaxed, clean (thank you), and simple atmosphere.\n\nThis is the only Thai Basil, of the local chains, that makes Pad Prik King and other \""off the menu\"" dishes -  so I keep coming back to this particular location."
25018,1,"Did I go to the same restaurant as all these other Yelpers?? I was seriously underwhelmed when I ate at here.\n\nAfter reading all the rave reviews, I decided to give this place a shot. I ordered the Pad Thai and while the portions were large, the quality was okay at best. I feel like I could have made that meal out of a box at home (and paid less).\n\nMy server was a very sweet young man and although he was busy many tables he still took time to talk to us, answer our questions, and our cups were never empty.\n\nThe atmosphere leaves much to be desired. The inside was dark and a little dingy-looking. We were seated facing the large, dirty fish tank in the back of the dining room... those poor fish looked beyond miserable. I had half a mind to start cleaning the tank myself.\n\nI won't be coming back. Thank God I found Lang Van to get my Vietnamese/Thai fix."
18018,4,"This has got to be the foodie deal of the century!\n\nMultiple options for the tasting menu, all way under $100, with wine pairing options under $50, for dishes that approach the level of, if not quite reaching, French laundry. On top of that, all the additional amuse bouches was like having two other tasting courses. I literally counted that we had 12 amuse bouches...yes, 12! And really good ones! True, most of them were truly half a bite sized, but if they were any larger, I really would have exploded. They even gave me a glass of sparkling wine to pair with an amuse bouche...I mean, who does that??\n\nTo start, the atmosphere of the restaurant is old school, and initially a bit stuffy...but the waitstaff were all extremely pleasant (as should be for this level restaurant). Throughout the meal, they do their best to be invisible, but the space is a bit small so I couldn't help noticing now and then someone intently watching us as we were finishing a plate so that they could clear it away. Having said that, there was one time that my husband got up to go to the restroom, I looked down for one second, and when I looked back a freshly tied napkin was in the place of the dirty plate that had been there. That's stealth. You can see Mr. Binkley at the service window the entire time, so you know that every dish is getting checked by him before going out...which is always gratifying to see. \n\nIf you're a bacon lover, or even if you're not but are ok with bacon, you have to try the applewood smoke bacon bourbon drink. It's amazing, and a great way to start off the evening. They serve it with a single large ice cube that fills the glass with applewood scented smoke (you can really smell it), and the bourbon really had a nice subtle smoky bacon flavor. They serve it with a garnish of sugar coated bacon on the side, which I could have done without, or would have enjoyed more if they had cut down on the sugar. It was like trying to eat a block of sugar with the bacon trapped way inside...perhaps I was supposed to stir it in the drink? Oh well, I still enjoyed it immensely. \n\nWe each chose the 5 course tasting menu that included both a meat and fish, and excluded the cheese plate. However, before our first dish, we were given an onslaught of 4 amuse bouches! A small cup of curried pear soup, a complex plate of duck pate with toast, a spoonful of chilled granita like fruit, and a miniature (I mean really mini, the size of a quarter) sloppy joe. After that, they slowed down to 1 to 2 amuse bouches between each plate. They really like to plate to dramatic effect, but it makes the whole experience more fun.\n\nI'm not going to go into any detail about our courses since the menu changes daily, but I thought every plate was spot on. Each dish is intricately plated and though some look like works of art, others aren't quite as pretty, but still taste fantastic. There are so many ingredients to each dish, that occasionally it's a little confusing as to what might be the best way to eat it, but I often just shovel everything into my mouth, and all the flavors would complement each other. The seafood was delicate, the meats were perfectly cooked in bite size portions (the mangalitsa pork was served 3 ways on the plate). All the dollops of sauces and garnishes were flavor packed. The desserts were lovely and not too heavy. \n\nI was pretty smashed by the end of the night, after 6 glasses of wine, but I still remember most of the evening! Having recently moved from the Bay area, and eating at some of the highly rated restaurants there, including French Laundry, this really is just as good at half the price. I will definitely be making many an excuse to eat there again. It's definitely taken away a little of the sting of having to leave San Francisco."
4772,2,"So I went back to this place to try something off the rest of the menu.  My husband and I both ordered the pho with well done beef.  While I was impressed with the freshness of the sprouts, the soup left a bit to be desired.  The beef was really fatty and the noodles were really over cooked.  I know asian places are not known for their customer service but when I ordered a drink with a number instead of the name, the waitress about crapped herself.  She yelled in shock as if I was trying to order two entrees.  At least the gentlemen who work there were friendly."
23947,3,"I've been to Babbo's several times since it is so close to my house. My two favorites are the Pasta Martini and the Gorgonzola Salad. The bread is excellent, and I've had no issues with the wine, so maybe I've been lucky? I've also had their pizza, I can't recall which one, but it was excellent with peppers and goat cheese. The ambiance is great as well, and prices are very reasonable. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the service has been sketchy at times. But, it isn't so bad that we won't return. Overall, a good place."
28300,1,"This was my second visit. I had a great experience my first time in- very personable waitress, great service overall and a really great sandwich. I ordered the cheese-stuffed tenderloin with their \""signature\"" white sauce. Disappointment. The sauce was yellow (the waitress said it was because of the addition of paprika) but honestly, it tasted like cheese wiz but on the watery side. It did not have a good flavor- very bland. The pork was pretty tough for being a tenderloin and I wished I had a serrated blade with which to saw through it. Not sure what happened today in the kitchen. In the future I will stick with sandwiches. They do that pretty well. And even though I left half of my meal on the plate there was no offer to discount my meal- even by 25%, which would have probably made me happy enough to have not even written this review. Restaurants are a tricky business. You have to be great in the kitchen -or hire someone who is - and have a great business sense- or hire someone who does."
32075,4,"Vegas is a foodie town, and Aria has a lot of wonderful restaurants.  If you ask me, Julian Serrano is the best restaurant in Aria and it's one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.\n\nI LOVE THIS RESTAURANT.  \n\nService is top-notch and fast.  For a party of 14, I was worried about the wait time for food.  No need to worry, they know what they're doing!  Food started coming out almost immediately.  Tapas are a terrific option for large groups.  The pace of dishes coming out was perfect.  Also our waiter was able to split up the bill (we ordered in groups of 3 to 5 people).  \n\nFinally, the food.  It's excellent!!  Everything is amazing but I particularly recommend the calamari, which is among the best I've ever eaten.  Other notable dishes include the salmon, the risotto, croquetas, peppers, papas bravas.\n\nYou simply cannot go wrong eating here."
29933,3,"Great place for a quick, healthy bite, featuring flatbreads, wraps, panninis, salads, soups...even quesadillas!  No matter what you choose, you know exactly how many calories are in each (the calorie count is next to each menu item). \n\nI devoured the chipotle chicken wrap (380 calories). The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the flatbread was the perfect thickness--soft but not flimsy. The chipotle sauce was flavorful, with just the right amount of heat.  My only complaint is the smaller portion of chicken--more is always better.  Try the peppadew hot sauce on your meal!  Wayyyyy better than Tabasco. \n\nIt would be PERFECT if there was one located closer to Scottsdale...So many tasty options, all at very reasonable prices--$5 got me the wrap, a drink and my choice of chips, a cookie or a brownie.  Beat that, Subway!"

26511,1,"I have mixed feeling about the W Scottsdale. During the day the pool area is poorly run, but in the evenings the pool turns into a pretty fun nightlife spot.  \n\nDaytime:\nThe pool is always jam packed with a fairly disgusting crowd and the dudes out number the babes by a 3 to 1 count I'd say. That's no fun. Oh, and by dudes, I mean douche bags. And Babes? More like gross skanks covered in makeup at the pool. Ok, I guess I'm being a hater, but spend a few hours here and you might be kind of disgusted with the scene too. It's just really amateur hour here with the piss poor service and their bad attitudes and obnoxious patrons. The only reason I came was because a friend likes to stay at the W when visiting and he too noted the quality of this place has declined over the years. He has stayed at four different W locations (NY, South Beach, Westwood) and said this one is the \""worst and trashiest\"". It took an hour before any waitress came over to ask if we wanted any drinks or food. When started to get service it was always a long wait for our pitcher of margaritas or buckets of beer and food. Speaking of the food, the fries, fish tacos and club sandwich are all great. The grilled cheese, not so much. The first $42 pitcher of margaritas was weak, hardly tasting any alcohol. The second pitcher was stronger. To be fair, the Saturday service was much better.\n\nNighttime:\nMuch improved scene, but still not great. There are a lot of out-of-towners since it is a hotel, but still plenty of locals too. I think it's a good mixture. Pants and collared shirts are required, so that usually gets rid of most of the tank top, neck tat wannabes from earlier in the day at the pool.  But really, you are just trading one group of wannabes for another. Man, I'm a hater huh? Oh well, you can handle it. Drinks are overpriced, but this is the W. Be ready to spend lots o' cash.\n\nRooms:\nI've been in a few rooms at this hotel. Each have been nice and clean, but pretty small."
14294,3,"I went here for a business dinner in March. We started with some good sake, although be warned that a good bottle there will easily be north of $150, potentially FAR north. The service was great as our party expanded in scope as the evening went on and the server accomdatd us with extra chairs, prompt menus, good suggestions and kept the food coming.\n\nThe food itself was well-prepared - I had skewers of organic chicken that were ecellent, although the portions are designed to be quite small. I think we closed the place. Definitely on my list next time I am in Vegas."
49145,4,"This store is really cool! Love going in there before a shift, to relieve stress... Who doesn't love Lego's?\n\nFrom the minute you walk in, you're greeted with energetic, fun people!

Since Vegas is a Travel Destination, it would be cool if they had some discontinued sets. \n\nThe prices are comparable with any other retailer. However, they have way better selection! \n\nI love this store, wish there were more locations."
5121,2,"We decided to eat here during our vacation in Vegas. We saw a lot of promotion for a half pound of crab with an 8 oz. crab for $9.99! We couldn't pass up this deal so, we decided to go check it out. We didn't realize the fine print that says we had to be a VIP member to get the exclusive discount. \n\nThe food came out pretty good. The crab legs were served a little weird. Usually, you would have to open the crab legs yourself, but they are served in halves so the dirty work is already done for you. Which was pretty nice.\n\nThe 8 oz. steak sounded a lot larger than it appeared. It looked like a tiny little steak that was served with some crab with mashed potatoes and 3 pieces of asparagus. \n\nThey could of have been a little more clear about the prices. Plus, there were no restrooms within the cafe. I had to walk across the casino floor to take care of business."
48423,0,"Was here for a private room party. The food was great, drink was great, the service staff was cool. Place was beautiful.\n\nWhy an \""Eek! Me think not\"" rating?\n\nAlong with dessert I was the only one that night who ordered coffee, I wound up with minor food poisoning.  Most likely the milk was tainted.\n\nSo if anyone is interested at this place I would say go for it but definitely AVOID getting coffee."

7511,0,"I was with a large group today (10 people) and a few minutes after we sat down a HUGE sewer roach crawled across my foot! I jumped up and screamed. Next thing you know it made it's way down the line and crawled over three of my friend's feet! Finally, we stepped on it and ran and got the waitress. Gross. This is no reflection on the waitress - she was very apologetic - but seriously, a happy group reunion turned into a total gross out. We all wondered what was creeping around in the kitchen that we couldn't see! The Mimi's in Scottsdale is nice, this location is dirty and the a/c in the back room where we were seated was turned up. We were all sweating. (It was 93 outside today). I think the roach was trying to escape to the air conditioned side of the restaurant! Will never go back to this location."
20879,4,"If there were 6 stars I'd rate this even better.  We found this place because of Man vs. Food. When you pass by the restaurant in China Town, it appears to be a shady massage parlor or some kind of strip joint!!  But when you walk through the doors, AMAZING!  Don't try to make reservations, this place gets too crowded for this.  And if you want to test out a new date, definitely bring 'em here.  This will determine if they like to get \""down and dirty\"" or if they have a problem digging in and eatin' a real good meal.   Prepare to have your sinuses cleared.  Don't count on having good conversation, you'll be too busy scarfing down yummy food.\n\nEverything about this place is great.  The customer service is SOOOO GOOD.  Almost all the servers are real friendly (and there are some that have been there a long time which is great).  The atmosphere (music could use a little help) is perfect for a fun group dinner (New Orlean's style).  Expect to have the best shellfish and seasoning in Vegas and expect to leave with your clothes reaking of Hot N Juicy!"
44898,1,"We should have got the shepard's pie, I think it would have been much better than the basic burger we split.  There was a legit gray hair in my ketchup too, so not cool!  I may have asked for a replacement, but as usual, my fianc\u00e9 grabbed the hair out of my dip and threw it on the ground, then deemed the ketchup good to go (he did this once before when I found a huge black fly on my pizza).  The service was good and the burger was not bad, but it was nothing special!!  Next time, we will go straight to Burgr and skip this place entirely."
33734,2,"I've not had Greek/Mediterranean food in awhile.  Was craving a gyro and baba ghanoush.  I ordered the combo platter with each item.  I was disappointed to see they use the frozen, thin, pre sliced strips of packaged gyro meat.  The menu said the meat is lamb.  When you say it's one thing - it shouldn't contain a blend.  This gyro meat is certainly a blended product.  Typically bad.   \n\nWhile I sat and looked at the gyro I had to make the best of it.  The pita was fresh and warm.  Other than the gyro meat the rest of the internal garnish in the product was fresh, crisp, and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing.\n\nThe baba ghanoush was ok.  It lacked color and texture.  I would hope a fresh made product (crossing my fingers on that one) would be a bit more robust and chunky.  This could be accomplished by fire roasting the eggplant. They tried their best to dress up the dish with a nice floral arrangement of sliced  cucumber.  I sadly had to add a touch of hot sauce to give it a little flavor.   \n\nFor around $12 you get a gyro, side, and a drink.  Not too bad.  It would be nice to see them utilize a better gyro meat product.  \n\nI'll try it again.....I will stay away from the gyro meat and try one of their other dishes"
34839,4,"Wandering Horse isn't the cheapest buffet around, but OMG what a buffet it is.\n\nI can sum it up in all up in five words:\n\nAll you can eat steak.\n\nAnd not crappy shoe leather steak--delicious mini kobe or other steaks, as much as you want, pile it high.\n\nAnd you can do the same with the chicken, the fish and shrimp, the pork and crab legs, the Mexican food, the Asian food, salad, veggies, and tons of different kinds of desserts but. . .\n\nThe steak--endless steak, tasty, tender steak, eat until you pop steak.

22618,2,"I'm really teeter toddling where to go with this review...\n\nDo I review the restaurant?\n\nDo I review the service?\n\nDo I review the atmosphere?\n\nOr do I simply review the entire experience?\n\nThis is a hard pressed 3 star review, because although our entire experience here was incredible (AKA Fiance's Parents took us here  for our engagement celebration) in all actuality that's really the best this location is REALLY worth. \n\nFirst off Mastro's, your food is literally crack, and I mean literally. Your Lobster mashed potatoes, your steaks and your \""Why Thank you I'll be a fatass and order the butter cake\"" dessert are AMAZING. \n\nHere's why I'm taking two stars off you...\n\n1. Your decor, although glowing neon red was cool in the 80's, having the bar illuminated with it reminds some of us of the movie \""Cocktail\"" and that's not in a good way. \n\n2. I shouldn't have to say this but, Scottsdale, you haven't changed. \n\nSo minus a star for all the backwards baseball hat wearing, rude, shouting, 30,000 dollar millionaires that jammed the dining room, also minus heavy points in my book for the guy wearing the cubic zirconium encrusted \""VERSCE\"" sunglasses inside, (and yes, they were spelled that way too). Learn some class people...Jesus. \n\n\nAlthough Mastro's is a fail safe, avoid this location and stick to Pinnacle Peak unless you want to be embarrassed by the locals in front of out of town guests."
4253,2,"Went to Fox & the Hound to watch an OSU basketball game.  Sat in the bar area, pretty dark and dismal, but eventually they figured out how to get the game on the big screen.  Nice TV's and plenty of seating.   Lunch was a bit pricey but not terrible.  Tried the signature turkey sandwich/club on a pretzel dough roll.   Very tasty, but add two draft beers and my bill was $15.00   didn't really think it was that steep of a bar/pub food kind of place but apparently so!  Overall, it was adequate for watching the basketball game and drinking a beer with lunch, but I doubt i'll be running back to return anytime soon."
12933,2,"We came here for breakfast before the long drive back home. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. I was pretty disappointed: tiny portion on a huge plate, a small piece of canadian bacon, and barely any hollandaise sauce. I can get better in San Marcos, CA. I will never order that again.\n\nMy friend upgraded his cappucino to the larger size (cup? bowl? I can't remember the name, sorry!). Essentially, this meant that for just a dollar more he received an entire soup bowl filled with cappucino. Crazy."
36233,1,"It's never a good sign when 27 seconds into walking somewhere, you feel as if you've made a horrible mistake... That you're about to witness an example of what  Ignatius J. Reilly would describe as  the contemporary world's lack of \""theology and geometry.\""\n\nI went to the Dominion Square Tavern about a week ago to meet Joanne. I thought it was a bar. But it's not. It's a sort of restaurant. But with a bar. But fancy. There's also a sign at the front that says you have to wait to be seated. So I waited. I wanted to sit at a table, but apparently you can only sit at a table if you're eating. So I had to sit at the bar and felt self-conscious the whole time that people could see my buttcrack...\n\nAnd that's the trouble with this whole thing, really. Because this is the kind of place where I go and I think that the problem, really, is me. Because as I sat there with Joanne, getting progressively drunker on blah-ish expensive drinks, eating so-so fries, developing that sinking imposter-syndrome feeling, the place kept filling up with people for whom this was all Just Fine - a good time on the town: sitting there without really experiencing any sort of discomfort at the faux-nostalgia of the whole thing, feeling ok with listening to hours upon hours of contrived acoustic string-band music."
552,4,"Ho Ho Cherry House is my favorite Chinese. \n\nMy criteria for picking Chinese consists of a crispiness factor - I usually get sesame chicken or General Tso's -and nothing is grosser then soggy chicken covered in thick sauce\n\n....This place does it just right - and its very very affordable (think very casual Chinese restaurant definitely not upscale!) - nice crispy/ light chicken complete with  pretty good although not super memorable side items such as fried rice and an egg roll. For me though, personally they have the crispy chicken nailed - so Im in!"
35700,2,"Killllerrr hummus and pita! Seriously fresh pita bread and the hummus tastes amazing. Only problem was the appetizer came out as a huge plate of hummus and only 4 small pita squares. Hummus to pita ratio was pretty weak, especially for 4 people. All we had to do was ask for more bread, and the server was happy to bring us a warm basket. The falafel wrap was really good, falafel was very tasty wrapped in hummus, tomato and cucumber. The service was on the slow side like the other reviews, but it wasn't a problem. The server was friendly and the cook/owner? came to our table to ask how everything was, always a classy move. The other dishes at the table were a vegetable couscous (average) and two shawarmas, which were much enjoyed. I'd go back - good prices, byob, good food!"
40322,4,"Why the hell aren't there more glowing reviews for this joint?!  I'll attribute that to the fact that its in a casino in the middle of no-damn-where.\n\nFirst of all, the honey butter with warm bread they give you to get started is incredible!  Fresh baked bread and the honey was literally poured over the butter!  So damn good!  \n\nCaesar salad.  Crab cake.  Both spot on, no complaints.\n\nI had the Ribeye which was cooked perfectly and a beautiful cut.  Baked potato with all the fixings on the side was deelish. Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert... Hell yes it was awesome!\n\nWe kept looking around the restaurant asking each other why the place wasn't packed.  Oh well, more for us!\n\nNOTE:  This review was posted late.  Our visit was in February 2012."
21488,2,"I used to love CPK when I was a kid, I would always go to the mall with my family and eat there. I guess now that I have gotten older and seen more places CPK has lost its appeal. It's kind of expensive for what you get, average food and ehh service. I ordered online and selected a time for pick up. I got there 5-10 min after the pickup time and waited around for someone to ring up my food. I'm like \""I'll be outside with my dog so come out and get me\"" The manager comes out and is like.. oh Im sorry we just put your order in the oven, here are some coupons for free apetizers. But I have to order $15 worth before I get the free appetizer. \n\nAnyways, I went there because I had a giftcard but from now on I think I'll ask for Subway giftcards instead."
27372,0,"I've been here about 5 or 6 times in the past few years. Every time I stay at Luxor I look forward to coming here. \n\nOur visit yesterday ruined it all. We checked in using Yelp! and foursquare.  There was a check-in deal on foursquare for \""Buy One get One Half Off\"" margaritas.   When we showed the offer to the server he was surprised and hadn't seen it before. He talked to the manager and was told that the offer was per person, meaning one person had to buy two margaritas for themselves to get the deal. Ok. Not a big deal -- it would only have saved me $6. The server asked if we wanted to see the manager for a better explanation. We agreed. \n\nThe manager Danny came to our table. He was extremely rude and insulted us before we even spoke. He said that it was his decision about how to administer a deal and that he wasn't changing his mind. Again, before we even spoke or asked a question. Odd. Then, he said that it was a corporate decision and that he 'wasn't getting in trouble for anyone.'. \n\nWhen I showed Danny the actual offer on foursquare, which lacked special fine print or terms, he said, \""Again. Sorry.\""\n\nDanny was a complete jerk over $6. He lost the restaurant a repeat customer."
2424,3,"I eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed my meal. This place grills a good steak, the bread that comes with you meal is really tasty and different. A must try is the rattlesnake..tastes like chicken.The atmosphere is fun and maybe a little overboard but in a good way. The magician here on the weekends is great so be sure to have him stop by your table his name is Flash."
31545,2,"I like this place... for what it is. I've been to Four Kings once, and we only went because of it's proximity to the train, right across the street. The first impression was very bad, as the bar smelled of something AWFUL like feet, onions, and stale alcohol.\n\nThey have plenty of coin-op pool tables which were all busy and apparently they are a big spot for neighborhood pool teams and clubs. There were even a couple of guys giving a lesson to a gentleman. They also have Golden Tee Live and a bowling game. \n\nBeer here is CHEAP, like $7 per large pitcher which comes out to less than two dollars a beer. I'll drink in a crappy dive like this for beer that cheap. Overall, we didn't feel like it was a great bar we want to go back to, but it was a good not too busy place to play golden tee or have cheap beer."
44747,4,I love Arizona Airbrush Studio. I get a great tan in minutes. It looks natural and lasts at least a week. I have sensitive skin and this is not at all irritating. Staff is also very friendly and make you feel comfortable
31892,3,"For the me, the service has always been great.  All the employees here have always been attentive and for once, not trying to rip you off.  I know how to work on cars and know when a mechanic or manager is trying to pull one on you.  Not this place.  In fact, I've been here twice where they fixed a flat without charging me a penny.  I will definitely be back the next time I need service for my car. \n\nNow for some facts...I have a company issued car meaning that all the service is paid by my company.  Also, any additional work needed is paid through by my company.  Not a bad deal for me so I can't begin to comment on the cost to get work done becauses I never have to pay out of pocket.  I am judging this place based on service and the fact that they never tell me I have something wrong when I don't.\n\nMy only gripe is the waiting room.  Nice TV, but no cable or DirecTV.  I know, now I'm getting picky.  I had to find something wrong, right?"
37018,4,"This is one of the four Carnegie museums in Pittsburgh and definitely a must-see! There is also the Carnegie Museum of Arts under the same roof! But I tell you, it takes one complete day to visit each of them! In the natural history museum, the major extraction I would say is the minerals, stones and gems exhibition! And then comes the Dinosaurs, so much for Pitts being the first place where the fossils were discovered! The forests/animals/birds of African setting were very life like!  Kids would love this place! \n\nOverall, a must visit if you come to Pitts!"
34187,1,Urban 7 I really want to like you but I cant. Went there for a mid week happy hour. The crowd was non-existent the service was good but awkward. May give it one more shot to redeem but for now 2 stars.
17054,2,"This place is good, don't get me wrong. I love this Italian style pizza, the service was good, and i enjoyed my meal. The thing is, if you go a few blocks over to eastern there is Grimaldi's pizza, which is that same Italian style pizza, but its just much better. The pizza was a bit cold and soft, so maybe mine was just undercooked, i dont know. Also the flavors were a little bland. So try this and you wont be too disapointed, but missing out on Grimaldi's would be the crime when its so close."
6634,1,"the outdoor seating was nice.  margaritas were pretty good.  food was not good at all.  So if you want to hang out on state street and have a drink, it's nice.  If you want good food, go somewhere else."
9817,3,"Yes it's a dark smoky bar, located in a strip mall, but there is one thing that really makes this different from the hundreds of other bars in town.\n\nThe food is great !\n\nMy normal is the club sandwich, in itself it is nothing really amazing, but throw is a quart or two of their honey mustard and I am in heaven.\n\nThe honey mustard is homemade, based on the receipt of the first restaurant manager.\n\nThe ribs are good to great, the service can be spotty, but is generally good and the prices are hard to beat."
31736,4,"This is one of the best Cajun restaurants I've ever dined. You could place this restaurant in New Orleans and it would compete with some of the best. My family and I have dined there twice, and I've sampled almost everything. The bottom line you cannot go wrong with anything you order. This restaurant was featured on Triple D and Guy hit this one out of the park."
7627,3,"I had to write a review about this place after my group was torn about going after reading some reviews about how dirty this place made them feel and how they were tore up from rocks. So we envisioned way dirty water that was a trickle at places with rocks in too shallow water where we would have to go done in single file. We were ready for the worst but it's really not that bad. \n\nIt was never less than 10 yards or so wide. Yes, people do loose their trash like beer cans but it's not as trash filled as other places like the beach or the park. They do throw giant marshmallows so you will encounter mushiness. And people are peeing in the river, (are you surprised?) but it's moving water, so it's like nature's toilet anyway (like the ocean). And most everyone is drunk but I know there is a lot more stupid going on in any bar on any sat or Fri night. So, basically, if you are prissy about being things being dirty, and are one of those people that can't have a little fun with other drunk people and look down on them for doing stupid things, you will not have a good time. FYI, you will also not have any fun in places like NYC or most dive bars which you will think is dirty. Most of the people are just lazing down the river with their friends. \n\nI would like to give some tips and warning: Bring water, rope to tie your rafts together, water shoes, spray on sun block, food/snacks and a DD. I have never EVER seen so many cops out on my 20 mile drive back to our place in my life. There were check points, and 3 cop cars pulling over 1 car, and people with their hands hand cuffed behind their backs. It's serious guys, don't mess with it.  Also, you will not notice how drunk you are until you stand up, so be careful not to drown."
36357,1,"Food wasn't bad... I've been in there three times now.  Love having a good breakfast place on Mill.  So why only 2 stars?  SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.  The last two times I went, it was incredible how long everything took.  And while it wasn't insanely busy, the staff were literally running around... sometimes carrying full plates!?  Waited about 20 minutes after sitting down to get that \""Has anybody helped you yet?\"", and then it took well over an hour to get any food.  If they would just tell you at the front counter that the wait was over an hour, I'd be fine with that.  Pretty much exact same experience 2 times in a row, but like I said I'm a sucker for a breakfast joint.  Maybe 3rd time is the charm?"
29844,1,One would think when there are only two other groups in the place they would get the order right but once again another place who seems to be lost in the service department and the food was just OK.
10063,2,"This was the first store we hit when we got to Fashion Show Mall.\n\nWe dont have a Hot Topic in Canada. I always enjoy going to stores we don't have.\n\nThis location wasn't overly big. Mostly Tshirts, cheap jewelry and \""Mall GothFashion\""\n\nI wasn't in the mood to try any clothes on or I would of checked out a few skirts I saw.\n\nWe only bought a few cosmetic items, bright blue & green liquid eyeliner, and a white eyeshadow. They were all on clearance which is funny since I only use high end cosmetics.  But I had forgot some of my makeup at home, and brightly colored liquid liner is sometimes hard to find.\n\nThe girl who rang us up had super cool nails. She wasnt overly friendly but did tell us how the salon did the tips all glittery.\n\nI now kinda wish I would of tried that skirt on ... Hmmm another reason to return to Vegas sooner, then later."
35462,3,"After reading many of the 5 star reviews I was hoping for this myself!...  Giving it 4 stars.\n\nPros: \nLively place- was nice place, staff nice\nSanitary (all instruments for pedicure in closed sanitized packs)\nPrices acceptable  30 for pedicure, 25 for french manicure\nBEST nail polish selection i have seen in a while. Lots of choices.\n\nCons\nThe guy doing my nails seemed to be in a bad mood. He wasnt rude, just wasnt happy and made me feel like he hated what he was doing.  I had to have him fix one nail because the nail dryer blew a piece of thread into the wet nail - he did the nail over but didn't seem \""happy to help\"", although he did it without hesitation. Even tho when he did he nail over it wasnt perfect and he left some of the white paint on my finger...\nNot a perfect manicure...  There were some slight in perfections in my french Manicure. Not anything horrible, just not perfect.  \n\nI will go back there though, all the other staff members seemed great and lots of customers were in there having a good time, seemed like regulars."
45091,3,"After reading the reviews on Yelp I knew I had to try this place for myself. My friends and I ordered the following:\n\n1. Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings [$9]\n2. Roasted Jalape\u00f1o Poppers [$12]\n3. \""Just Fries\"" [$8]\n4. Chanterelle Burger [$16]\n5. Hell's Kitchen Burger [$14]\n6. Farm Burger [$15]\n\nIf I had to choose one item from the list above I would choose the Roasted Jalape\u00f1o  Poppers! \n\nThe food and service was great but if you go during a busy time you'll most likely end up waiting 30+ minutes before getting seated."
36470,3,Yummmm is all I have to say.  The chicken fingers were delicious. And I'm not sure of what they do to their fries but they were really good as well. I wasn't a huge fan of their new bourbon sauce or their chipotle bbq (very watery) but everything else was good. I'll definitely go again!
39271,4,This place is always good. Food and atmosphere is always amazing great ambiance overall.
31620,2,"The seating is outdoors, very limited, under very high powered fans with mist. Not really ideal for eating.\n\nHusband wanted The Lord of the Rings dog which was no longer on the menu but they made it for him anyway. So that was nice. I ordered the Chicago Polish Dog. Both tasty enough.\n\nI think the price was around $7 for the hot dogs and $3 for the drinks. \n\nWe split an order of onion rings with the parents. They are the thick cut rings and the batter was a bit on the sweet side.\n\nOverall decent experience for the price but I suspect there are better dogs to be had in Chicago."
22253,4,"Oh what a terrific restaurant this is!  On this second visit (for me) I was joined by Robyn N., & I ordered what I suggest YOU try for your first visit, a Carne Asada Torta Norte\u00f1a with salad for the included side.  (Skip the chips & order a 99 cent side of their delicious ceviche if you want a little something more.)\n\nWhat you get here is stellar everything!  It's a clean, it's comfortable, the service is friendly & attentive, the food portions are generous, & the prices reasonable.  You will leave full, & having just eaten some of the best food you have ever tasted!  YUM!!     :-))\n\nCarne Asada Torta Norte\u00f1a $7.49."
11870,2,"Wow, this place is very very hyped up.\nIn my opinion kind of overrated.\n\nThey have pretty yummy soups. \nThey are always super packed so they take FOREVER!\n\nI think the food is good, but honestly I had better.\nThe menu is a freaking encyclopedia, so maybe I just haven't ordered the right thing?\n\nIt is a local fave, so maybe it's worth giving it another chance."
26347,0,"We are in the midst of a very stressful transition, moving across the country from Charleston, SC to Portland, OR, in order to access better educational and therapeutic resources for our daughter Camille, who has Cerebral Palsy.\n\nOne of US Airways' gate agents, Connie Owens, took it upon herself this morning to make our travel even more difficult, stressful, and inconvenient. I do not have sufficient words to express my absolute disgust and disappointment with Ms Owens' lack of compassion, flexibility and courtesy.  \n\nWe have flown with our daughter many times in the past eight years, usually taking US Airways because their crews have been unfailingly helpful, sympathetic and courteous.  Until now.\n\nCamille is now twelve years old, nearly 100 pounds, and almost five feet tall.  She is non-ambulatory, non-verbal, has autistic-like sensitivities, and often will require one or more diaper changes on a long flight.  Consequently, we always sit as close to the back of the plane as possible, as she is much too large to change in the tiny bathroom, and past flight crews have been very accommodating in arranging to either block off the aisle, screen off the last row of seats, or allow us to use the floor of the galley when everything is locked down after service.  \n\nWe were explaining this to the flight crew and Ms Owens when she took it upon herself to insist that that absolutely could not be done, that we were only allowed to change Camille in the bathroom, which is physically impossible, and to aggressively verbally berate my wife Christina over wanting to make some arrangement so that we could get to our destination with a minimum of discomfort and inconvenience to ourselves and our fellow passengers.  \n\nHer aggression set off our daughter into a loud and prolonged screaming fit.  Rather than wait for the meltdown to pass, or to back off and give us a chance to calm our daughter, Ms Owens immediately contacted security to have us removed from the plane, which was unnecessary, humiliating, and a tremendous inconvenience.  \n\nThe security manager, Mike, was extremely kind, courteous and helpful as he assisted us from the plane, and consequently rebooked our flights for tomorrow, and set us up at a hotel near the airport. Nonetheless, this has made a difficult and stressful trip even more so, and has caused us to have to scramble to rearrange things at our point of arrival.  \n\nWe are also stuck in a hotel without most of our luggage and some of our prescriptions. This has been, overall, a horrible experience, and certainly will make us think twice before flying US Airways or its affiliates again.  In addition, I cannot imagine that Ms Owens' actions were in any way acceptible per the ADA.  \n\nI attempted to call to make and resolve this complaint, but the agent and supervisor I spoke with insisted that it could only be addressed through a web form, promising contact in one to three business days, which is infuriating.\n\nOn the positive side, Yvonne J, another gate agent, was tremendously helpful and compassionate.  We also received assistance from an airport maintenance man, whose name I did not catch, in replacing a bolt on the wheelchair that broke as we were bringing it up the gangway.  \n\nSpecial needs flyers and parents - have you had similar experiences? Advice? Insights? How do I get people to treat my child like a human being?"
43098,4,"Amazing cupcakes & Great Service! The ordering process was simple and easy.  Free Delivery to my hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Ordered days before and they were able to accommodate my request.  Needed one nonalcoholic cupcake and it was no problem!  Overall great experience with Sin City Cupcakes and I would recommend to anyone staying on the Strip from out of town who doesn't have a car while on vacation. Not to mention, they were very tasty!!!"
1936,2,"The tellers are really nice and helpful and there's rarely that long of a wait.  The thing that I have noticed specifically about this one is that when I want to make a cash deposit at their ATM's, it is not able to go forward with the transaction.  Now this has happened at least 3 different times.  I have large amounts of cash that I would like to deposit, but it won't let me and it's not like I leave home just to run to the bank and come back.  I make my first stop at the bank and then continue the rest of my errands, which I don't feel comfortable carrying a lot of cash on me.  Sometimes, I'm on my way to the gym and I have to leave the cash in the car (it's hidden and there's an alarm, but it's still nothing I feel comfortable doing)."
19019,0,"This review is for service only as I did not see any flower arrangements.\n\nI was looking for a local florist to help with my wedding flowers. Instead of buying the flowers from an online wholesale site, I preferred to buy from a local florist - however, I wanted to do the centerpieces and bouquets myself.  I went to Gloria's (and I believe I spoke with Gloria herself) and she was very, very rude to me. She did not like that I wanted to do the arrangements myself - which is fine if she said no, she wouldn't order flowers for me. However, she said she would order flowers for me but she just gave me attitude about it in the process. She, then, proceeded to ask me what kind of flowers I wanted. When I responded to say that I didn't know yet and was hoping a florist could help give me some guidance, she seemed shocked. \""You DON\""T KNOW??\"" I told her my wedding colors and, again, requested guidance from an expert.  She, again, asked me why I didn't know what flowers I wanted and then started to begrudgingly show me some flowers. By this point, I was very fed up and let her know that I would not be needing her services.\n\nSo, while I can not review any of her actual arrangements, I can say that my experience with this florist was extremely rude and I would prefer to go somewhere else."
12249,2,"High end for high maintenance. If you're looking to make a serious crack in your credit card I'd suggest taking it here. The decor is very nice, the people not so much. If you don't look like you belong, i.e. having white straw bleached fake blond hair and a faux tan then you'll probably get snubbed by at least one of the other shoppers or a store clerk. Not really my style, but 3 stars for the nice building and fixtures."
22257,3,"I was craving fruit for breakfast, so when my boyfriend pulls up at a Mexican restaurant, I was a little skeptical. I was wrong! Fully admitting this. The big fruit platter with honey was so fresh and perfect. I had a mango juice that was literally pureed mango. Amazing.  Boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros. Also mui bueno. I guess this joint was on Food Network for their gigantic burger. Man v.s Food.... That guy. So, funny thing is, his face is plastered all over the restaurant, including on the servers shirts!! It's cool that he could give them the spotlight they deserve!"

23936,0,"This was our fourth time eating at Red White and Brew and must say I was throughly disappointed.  It seems that we have gone from great to good to OK and now TERRIBLE.  First and formost the service was TERRIBLE with a capital T.  We got more attention from the person that was not our server than the person responsible for our table.  As for the food, 3 of our 4 meals were below average at best and one of us came down with a serious case of indigestion.  I will say the only bright spots of our trip today were that the bread in the beginning was fresh and the kids ice cream at the end.  Everything in between was bad.  Due to this experience I am sad to say that Red White and Brew has lost a customer."
28700,1,"The food is good. The service on the hand was dreadful!!! Our server was slow and it seem like he might have been new. If he wasn't, then god help his other tables! It was a Wednesday and the place wasn't crowded. Yet, the kids food took forever. Oh, guess what? He brought the wrong meal out. I love their phone and not fond of this location"

32024,4,"I have historically bought my bicycles at Budget Bikes in Madison. I still love Budget, but I cannot say enough good things about the team at Trek East. \n\nWe purchased a road bike for my wife in March, 2012 and they have been wonderful about tune-ups, minor repairs and recommendations ever since. \n\nThis past weekend my wife unfortunately took a tumble (well, actually, SOARED) over her handlbars while on a ride in Green County. Her drop bars and shifters were pretty banged up. We took the bike in to the Trek store and they immediately went to work re-setting her shifters and re-wrapping her handlebars, but only after what seemed like every person on staff asked if she was okay from the fall.\n\nTerrific, friendly service like this is priceless. \n\nThank you, Trek East!"
24311,2,"At Teharu you get what you pay for - which is $2 sushi. It's not the most amazing thing in the world, but for the price it's a decent experience. The conveyor belt is the main draw-in factor for me, but the food and service does leave a little to be desired. It's not exactly fresh all the time, but it's alright. There are better sushi places out there, but if you want a cheap meal that's decent, Teharu is the place for you."
18445,3,"One of my favorite places to grab lunch, and do a little work that requires wifi.\n\nI found this place one day just driving around and stopped for a cup of coffee, they had wifi, but I couldn't connect to my vpn.. but that has been fixed and they probably have one of the robust wifi locations around!\n\nBut first, let me talk about the food and the service.  It seems like EVERYONE that comes here is a regular, including me.. but no worries, you will be treated like a regular the minute you walk in.  The folks that run the place all seem like they LOVE what they do, love talking to customers and take pride in what they do, which is provide great food with some nice atmosphere."

9853,0,"I could not wait to come home to write this review.  I paid for this on Las Vegas.com and chose it because it is a castle and we have a two year old.  It was also the cheapest out of all of the hotels although last month we vacationed at the Luxor for about the same price with better customer service.  When we arrived I was told that there was a resort fee of $22.  That was unexpected but cool so I paid cash. The following morning I get a message light telling me to call guest services which I did and was told that I still owed the resort fee.  The woman was rude to me as though I was trying to get away with something and snorted when I told her that I'd paid cash and that should be in their system since after all I was in the room...hello?!  Then she told me that there was no note of it and that I bring down the receipt.  Well that just pissed me off as it was early morning and when I described the guy who helped me as Hispanic she answered, \""So you are saying that he's Mexican?!\""  Like what?!  I told her that I didn't know specifically the nationality and asked if there was any log of me checking in and she said, \""Well yes, but you need to pay.\""  I asked for the manager.  He came on and told me that the employee was off that day but he would check into it.  We went to have breakfast at the little table in the room and when I sat down I was stuck in my upper thigh by a skinnny piece of metal sticking out of the arm of the chair.  I called down and once again the rude woman on the line just said, \""Well, what chair and are you coming down to pay what you owe.\""  There was no, \""I'm sorry that you were hurt are you okay?  We'll send someone right away to take the chair out since you have a two year old with you...or anything like that.   This time I told her that she was rude and she just transferred me to the manager named Mark.  He was nice enough and told me that he didn't understand the rudeness and would speak to her and that they would extend our checkout time until 3p.m.  We agreed I put some Neosporin on the pin prick on my leg and we went out to lunch since we had time to pack.  We got back at 1:40 p.m. and when we tried the door key it didn't work.  I called on my cell the hotel number three times to no answer and finally a supervisor of the maids came by and called security.  The guard got there but first had to let another family into the room.  Then when I told him that we had called downstairs and that they were rude about the call he responded, \""Well what do you want me to do, I can't answer for other people.\""  He opened our room and left.  I laughed at that point because truly you do get what you pay for.  I don't know if the issue of the \""resort fee\"" was solved but I did go down to speak to them again and absolutely no record of my paying cash was lodged and I wasn't given a receipt and they also had no idea that I'd paid the hotel fee on line completely.  It was a disaster.  Leaving on a positive note, the wading pool was great for small children.  Otherwise it was a horrible experience and the unfortunate end to my lovely summer vacation as a teacher on break. Advice:  Spend the extra money and skip the castle."
14636,3,"I had lunch here with 2 others for $26 on a Monday and I didn't realize I've been here before until I saw the decor. haha We came around 3p to stick around for dinner, when all the seafood and crab legs come out. For a lunch price and to get all that food it was a good deal.\n\nThe quality of food was good, both times. I think it's better than the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. There was a large variety of food all of which were good. Usually, at Vegas buffets, the sushi is crap, but at the Buffet, the sushi was pretty decent. \n\nThe stalls in the restrooms are similar to private rooms, so you can do your business in semi-privacy. You'll load up on food, mull around for an hour, chat it up, unload the load you just put in, then load up again. haha"
12053,1,"Alright although they had a fabulous selection of beer, the food was not to my liking....\n\nI was very intimidated by the portions which are comparable to the size of a human head, so I decided to play it safe with a salad...BIG mistake. The salad was served in the exact same bowl my family and I use to serve salad at Thanksgiving dinner NO JOKE! It was filled to the brim with salad covered in tons of cheese, too much dressing, and less than extraordinary chicken.\n \nSo basically I had 3-5 bites and was done just because I was so grossed out. I wish the server would have mentioned the salad was big enough to feed the whole table and the one next to us. But he just completely ignored the fact I didn't eat any of it. But everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their gargantuan meals. I will not be going back to eat there."
36658,4,"Went here in July with colleagues; was surprised it was not listed on Yelp!  So, this is my first time to add a new restaurant for others to discover.  The food was excellent.  And the star of the experience was the unique approach of dual wine pairings - one which is an expected match (the accord) and an unexpected match (the discord).  Everyone enjoyed their food, the staff was quite cordial and the wine was, indeed, a nice fit to the culinary experience.    Check this place out and be one of the first Yelpers to see what you've been missing."
25035,3,"I struggled with what rating to give this place.\n\nThe food was among the best that I've had anywhere and certainly the best in Las Vegas, and that's saying something, with the long list of great restaurants in the city.  The langoustine ravioli was a dish I will remember 5 years from now.  The bread cart had some of the best bread on it I've ever had.  The ambiance was so beautiful that I couldn't believe I was inside the MGM-Grand.  The service was as good as I've had.\n\nBut oh, the price.  Don't get me wrong - I've eaten at a lot of very expensive, very nice restaurants in my time, but this is in a different league for pricing.  The tasting menu there, at almost $400 is twice what some of the best restaurants in the world charge.  Is it worth twice what Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, Per Se and El Celler de Can Roca charge for their food?\n\nI don't think so, hence the 4 star rating.\n\nIf you are a whale and have an unbelievable comp balance come here.  If you are foodie, you have to do JR at least once.  But I couldn't see coming here with any regularity."
10869,0,"When I approached the service manager with the concern that his people were damaging my car with the way that they were lifting it, he blew me off.  Now I have a jack with my vehicle that I can no longer use the way that it was designed because the \""certified technicians\"" at ted wiens auto smashed my pinch weld flat and bent my rocker panel  with the way that they treated my vehicle.  Stay away, if you care about your car then take it somewhere else."
18337,3,I like almost everything about LVAC except that sometime the workers are cleaning the pool area while I'm trying to relax in the jacuzzi. I don't like water splashing around and the smell of the sanitizer.  Note: It was not during the cleaning hours that is posted.
40402,0,"Bought a Groupon for 3 months of membership and in the \""how to\"" section it requires us to call (702)818-5800 to register. After numerous attempts during their \""staffed\"" hours at 10am-6pm to register, they finally leave a voicemail for my friend and lets us know that we can come in anytime 10am-6pm to register. We have to register to get the key so we can have 24 hour access to their facility.\n\nToday me and my friend go to anytime at 2:15PM and try to open the door for the guest entrance. Surprise surprise it is locked. There are people in the gym of course, the other customers who already have a key to access the member access entrance. Where is the staff? There is no sign that says \""out for lunch\"". Don't call it staffed hours if there is no staff working. Called a handful of times while waiting outside and no one answers. Bigger waste of time than trying to order a steak at a vegan restaurant. \n\nDefinitely not the best business people. Will update when the \""staff\"" contacts us back."

39542,1,"Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nI felt like it was really uncomfortable in this place.\nLike there was no real dance floor\n\nFrom all the hooplah on this place's Facebook page about a strict dress code, I expected the clientele here to be a bit... well... classier?  Better dressed?  I dunno...\n\nIt just seemed kinda trashy, very uncomfortable, and I don't think I'd ever go back.  Bleh."
19215,4,"A business colleague and I were visiting Phoenix and when we asked for dinner recommendations, St. Francis was one of two. The local pointed out that St. Francis largely uses locally bought veggies, in particular, while also having great food.\n\nWalking into St. Francis, it's clearly an eclectic, fun environment. The menu is just as attractively unusual -- and every appetizer, drink and dish we ordered was delicious and full of flavor.\n\nThe goat cheese appetizer wasa good -- the meatball appetizer was great. The almond margarita was unique, tasty and strong. We also had the roast chicken and pork chop - both were excellent. It seemed a little unusual to have just a piece of chicken on the plate, but the \""sides\"" were under the chicken, and on top. The flavor was amazing - the fresh veg made all the difference.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and ready with recommendations. We happened to go at happy hour, which features an impressive range of options - bonus!\n\nCan't wait to return to St. Francis next time I'm in Phoenix."

48244,1,"I went for dinner on a friday night, just my husband and I.. We were in the area and had heard about Flipside being a fresh, new restaurant that served food from local farms and thought we would try it. We walked in to a tiny little cafe, with randomly sized tables scattered everywhere.. Some full of people, some dirty, and some empty. There wasn't a hostess stand.. just a stack of menus on the nearest counter and someone from across the cafe greeted us and told us we could seat our selves. \n  There were a lot of different size tables and all very close together.. We chose a 2 top near the cafe counter and looked at the menu that only had food listed on it. No drinks anywhere. Nor was any of the meals described in much detail.. Just... Meat + Sides + Price. The Waitress came by took our drink and food orders.. She returned with drinks, but no silverware... I snagged my own set from an abandoned table next to me ( it was so close, I didn't even need to stand up ) The food took a pretty long time to come out.. and in the meantime we watched as random people trickle in and seated themselves, and  our lone waitress serving them all while other people working in the cafe bringing plates of food out awkwardly, and having to maneuver themselves thru the tables and serve people.. It was weird and seemed really unprofessional.\n Finally my food came.. It was good, nothing to complain about! I had BBQ Half Chicken, with Spinach and Mac N Cheese.. Once I was done, we inquired more about the ingredients and technique to prepare the food and the waitress had no idea what to tell us.. She repeated what was listed on the menu and then came back later to offer us slightly more info about the BBQ sauce having honey in it..?  It was laughable, but no harm done.. My final opinion of the Flipside cafe would have to be that its just TRYING too hard to be something It can't. Maybe Breakfast or lunch is better? But trying to eat Dinner in such a cramped space, with \""gourmet\"" prices and untrained/casual service is backwards and confusing."
16386,0,"if i could give this place less than one star i would.\n\nthis place was horrible. i had a habenjero burger - i think they mixed the pepper with garlic. it wasn't spicy at all. the fries are also coated in garlic and ... i ate a good lot of them because they were bareable, but they were pretty damn gross. the house beers are lame.\n\nit was WAY over priced for food that didn't deserve to be on a Chili's menu.\n\njust please. go somewhere else.\n\nalso, my girlfriend had a martini and there was a pit in the olive... that was a bit startling.. so, if you DO go, be prepared for that."

41456,4,Oh the butterburgers and the concretes. Got to love the frozen custard concretes. That you can mix in any two things you want from there list of many. Inside tip: They also have chocolate custard not just vanilla. This I found out after a few visits. I always get chocolate custard with chocolate sauce and Oreo cookies. I think its the best.\nThe burgers are really good. So are the onion rings and the cheese curds. I have never heard of cheese curds before Culvers. Must be a Wisconsin thing but they are really good. To call them fried cheese balls don't do them justice. Just try them. If you like cheese you will like these.\nThe service is pretty good. Sure it takes awhile to get your food but that just means they are making it fresh. For that I am willing to wait. Plus they give you your concrete first so you can enjoy that while you pull forward in the drive thru to wait for the rest of your order. They give you a number and then bring out your food right to your car.\nIt is a little expensive to eat more than once a week but it is well worth it.

49714,4,"Food this good should not be coming from a bar in strip mall, but good lawd!\n\nI know what you're thinking, \""5 stars for a Gastro Pub?\"", seriously though this place has some of the best bar food I've eaten in a long time and I use the term, \""bar food\"" loosely. I mean house smoked Pastrami Egg Rolls, Fried Kobe Beef Sliders and a insane calamari dish. Who's the f**king mad scientist in the kitchen?!\n\nRebel Republic is tucked away in a random strip mall off Sahara Ave. and the only reason I was able to spot it, is because of their giant glowing neon blue ribbon sign. Finally, all those years of drinking that terrible PBR slop are paying off. When you walk up to Rebel Republic you first notice a keen little patio area outside of the restaurant possibly for sipping and sampling. I got here around 1a.m. and it was still too hot to eat outside, so I decided to belly up to the bar.  \n\nThe beer selection can be overwhelming even to the most veteran hop heads. From what I understand they have over 52 beers on tap at all times, which is music to my ears; \""I'll start with the Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA\"". As I sipped my beverage, I noticed that the menu items here were very intriguing. \""Bartender, who's in charge of the food?\"" \""Oh, we hired a chef to come in and revamp the menu and then teach the permanent chefs how to prepare each item\""... Oh you fancy huh?\n\nThis made sense.  As I stated in the first paragraph the food here is amazing and is made fresh to order 24 hours a day! Literally you can get Kobe Beef Sliders at four in the morning... how awesome is that? Speaking of the super sliders, these are amazing little bites of heaven, perfectly cooked, seasoned, and placed between two soft pillows of sweet bread. Oh mama!\n\nThe Pastrami Egg Rolls is pretty much exactly what it sound like. You know, delicious! Salted cured meat, wrapped in filo-dough, deep fried, and served with a house made thousand island sauce. Seriously, this goes great with a solid IPA.\n\nThe final thing I decided on was the calamari. This comes in a bowl with pickled seaweed. (I'm not sure about that?) These tasty morsels resemble that of a sweet and sour chicken, but taste just like perfectly cooked calamari with a spicy, saucy coating. I almost ordered another round. \n\nRR has a very chill vibe and the decor of a Midwestern family's basement. Animal heads and wood paneling for days. Plus the servers here are very helpful when it to comes to ordering beers. They will have a beer sample ready and in your hand before you can even ask the question, \""is that a hoppy beer?\"" \n\nPRO TIP: Check-In when you arrive and get a $2 PBR. If you're into that sort of thing."
16658,3,"Linda S. does not wait in long lines for food...except today. Today was about subjecting my family to driving across town to a long wait inside a smoke filled casino which has surely stunted my daughter's growth...all in the name of PAN ROAST. I would have lived the rest of my life ignorant of such a dish, but I became aware of this PAN ROAST in my quest for clam chowder in Las Vegas. The name itself brought images of a sort of pot roast, and of course this is sooo not even close.\nI've been to Palace Station for conventions and would not have guessed I would be dragging my family here to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Crazy. I was hoping the line wouldn't be too bad, but we ended up waiting 1.50 hours to get our food. About 45 minutes into waiting, I noticed the 21 & over sign, so we inquired about take out since we had our daughter with us. They do offer take out but we would still have to wait. They only have about 18 seats at the bar. 18 seats plus 13 people ahead of us translated into about an hour to be seated.\nI was especially curious to see how they prepare the pan roast. They use special steam pans and the food is cooked right in front of you. The chef was very jovial and interacted with patrons. Maybe if he just cooked, it would go faster. But the customers seemed to enjoy it and the servers were very nice.\nI am terrible with remembering chronological order but here is my account anyway. If I missed anything, please feel free to let me know as I would like to attempt this recipe at home :) \nFirst came a scoop of butter, then garlic and chopped veges (looked like onions, celery and red peppers). Then I think he added the fresh seafood, followed by a ladle of clam juice. He let it cook until bubbly. Next came the sprinkle of chili powder to taste (1-10 level) and other seasoning...possibly celery seed. He let it cook some more. Then a splash of brandy and white wine. Finally a healthy ladle of a creamy red stock. Cooks it some more until hot and bubbling. The last step that put a smile on everyone's face was when he tips the pan into the bowl, puts a scoop of white rice and serves it up. The long wait is over :) Nom, nom, nom! Be careful not to burn your mouth as it comes out very hot.\nPAN ROAST is a delicious and creamy seafood stew full of flavor. The combo pan roast has shrimp, lobster and crabmeat. Not at all fishy and very satisfying. The broth is rich and so flavorful,  you won't believe that you finished the entire thing...I know I didn't.\nThe CLAM CHOWDER  is one of the best I've had. Creamy but not heavy. Tender pieces of clams and small little chunks of potato (not too much). Another winning dish here.\nI am happy to say that I would venture another trip to the Oyster Bar for the PAN ROAST and Clam Chowder."
42938,2,"Went into this restuarant with high hopes.  I've passed by it walking on 5th a few times and it always looks elegant and busy, so when my company offered to treat our whole office to dinner on them, I suggested 5Church.  Mandi Bane, the sales director, assisted me with coordinating it and was absolutely wonderful.  I must've sent her a dozen emails with changes and updates on our party and reservation.  We were going to be a party of 11 on a Thursday evening at 8:15 PM.  Kudos to 5Church for accepting my company's strange request of paying via check, too!  You made life so much easier on an accounting level!  \n\nWe arrived feeling like rock stars and were treated as such.  We had our own area of the upstairs and each couple had their own individual table in a U-shaped which was so unique.  Brandon, our server, had all the instructions about our party and payment and he was incredible.  Attentive, knowledgeable, patient...honestly, best service EVER.  \n\nWe started with drinks and one of my guests ordered 2 bottles of bubbly.  Brandon poured our glasses, we toasted, and then....warm champagne hit my palate.  Something was said and one of the managers (I'm assuming) hurriedly came out with another bottle that was slightly more chilled.  Very classy.  \n\nI ordered a beverage called the Viper, a trendy concotion of cucumber and tequila with a surprising kick of pepper.  It was unique.  \n\nSoooo....why only 3 stars?  Well, because frankly the food was terrible.  We had heard about the 60-second strip steak and ordered it medium rare which we knew would come out close to moo-ing.  We didn't know it would be served almost raw and cold.  I was expecting it to be seared on the outside (so hot) and cool on the inside.  It was served on top of mashed potatoes-also cold.  And the sauce tasted like a jazzed up version of A-1.  (My apologies to the chef, but it has to be said).  Of the four people in our party that ordered 2 sent it back and requested it be taken off the bill.  Me and my boyfriend choked it down, but was displeased with the entree after having such high hopes.  \n\nI will say that I will probaly go back for drinks and an appetizer.  We did share the meat tray and that was lovely.  I told Brandon that the proscitto was the best I had ever had. As for service and atmosphere, 5Church really shined, but the entree of the hyped up steak was a major letdown."
17425,3,"Have I mentioned that I love dive bars? This is a great dive bar. Small, but not overly sticky and dirty. Friendly bartenders and patrons. Standard beer selection. And there's pool and other things too. It's dark and just slightly sleazy. This definitely a good place to kill time, lose some money, and enjoy some cold beers."
15142,2,"I wouldn't say you can really get french food here.  It may be american food with a french twist, but that may be even stretching it.  That said, I've been here a couple of times.  I came here for dinner Saturday night.  I ordered the french onion soup.  For some reason, I was actually expecting it to be worse, but it was okay.  The piece of bread they put in my soup was huge and they had so much chesse on top, but the broth was pretty tasty.  The turkey wrap I order was lackluster though.  It didn't have much taste at all, but the fries were good.  This place might be okay for late night dining since I think they're open 24 hours, but I wouldn't come here for dinner again."
32445,2,"I really hate gambling at Hard Rock, but came here to meet some friends to party. We got bottle service and had a table outside, too bad it was like 50 degrees that night, but whatever. They had this fire pit thing outside that everyone went near to keep warm, or you can go inside. It was pretty crowded but it was a decent crowd nonetheless. The place isn't super huge but seemed like there was enough space to walk around, dance, chill and stuff. The waitresses were nice and the bouncers weren't total douchebags so all in all I had a good time. I would actually go here again."

The food here is really delicious, and they offer a decent selection of typical appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and entrees (think spinach and artichoke dip, chicken sandwiches, and steaks).  While you will have a great meal, beware- the wait can be atrocious for lunch or dinner on any given day of the week, especially the weekends."
12045,3,"Had a pretty good dinner at Mallorca, close to 5 stars, but not there (which is probably a lot, considering I am from Spain, and the owner is not). I started with a Gazpacho that was not very good. It lacked the texture and the taste, so I was anticipating a poor meal. Luckily, I had also ordered an octopus appetizer. The octopus was extremely tender, cooked to perfection. Unfortunately the potatoes that went with it were undercooked. That was kind of sad. It is so hard to cook octopus well that it is unfortunate to have the potatoes miss the bar. By the way, the portion of octopus was huge. I then had an excellent entree of Monkfish, very fresh and well cooked. I thought all the side dishes (chips, vegetables, and rice were unnecessary and did not add anything to the meal, honestly). I finished with the catalan-style Creme Brulee.\n\nThe wine list is pretty good and I was able to find some excellent spanish wines, although they are a bit overpriced. I went for a Priorat (Camins by Alvaro Palacio).\n\nThe service was pretty good, and they even offered free ham and cheese and liquor. That is very \""typical spanish\"" so it gave it a nice touch.\n\nI felt it was overall a very good experience although maybe a bit pricey. If I had known portions were so huge, and there were so many side dishes I might have skipped some of the appetizers though."
15058,4,"Came here with a bunch of girlfriends for brunch and I must say this was one of the best brunch buffets I have been to in a very long time.. Everything was made fresh, tasted good and the servers were helpful and attentive.  My favorite station was the crepe... both savory and sweet made to your liking... everything tasted delicious!!  never a long line and many different types of food to please any palette.\n\nCute decoration makes you think you are sitting in a lil cafe in a village in Paris... very nice touch.  Very satisfied for coming here and will definitely be back."
44057,3,"Hawaii 5-0 makes for a good tv show, and an even better cocktail! Be warned though, what tastes like a delicious, refreshing pineapple juice and fizzy water combo does actually contain a good amount of alcohol...so don't be fooled!\n\nAnyhow, the real cherry on top of the proverbial sundae is the 2-for-1 deal from 11PM until close on Friday nights (and also Thursday and Saturday nights, according to their website)!! How DLUX even manages to stay in business with a deal this great eludes me, but I'm sure going to take advantage of it for as long as I possibly can!"
13727,3,"I just came here for lunch yesterday and it did not disappoint. Their pasta, seafood, and desserts are really good and I got full off of those alone. They do have sushi hand rolls and california rolls but they aren't anything special. I was sold once I had the parisian macaroons for dessert....yummm! The only thing I didn't really like was the kobe beef. It was as rare as it gets which is just not my style. it was so rare that I had to basically saw it to cut it but even then it was too rare to enjoy. I didn't try the other beef cuts but my boyfriend kept going back for seconds so it must've been good. Definitely worth the $20 something dollars per person!"

40962,2,"Seems like with rotating changes to the foodie landscape in Cave Creek, there are always new places to replace the old ones going out of biz. Such is the case here. The bldg sat empty for a bit and then... like magic the Tap Haus appears. But...so far it just sort of a space filler on Cave Creek Rd.\n\nWhile the people are nice enough it's a mixed bag of good and \""so so\"" that is worth a trial period but doesn't bang me over the head to go back 2 or 3 times a week.  We've been there several times as it's not \""that bad\"" and even on New Year's Eve wound up there. Service has been adequate and the last time even extra good. Consistency is still the key to any food operation and they're still trying.\n\nFor the most part, the food is a 6-7. The pasta with Chipotle sauce was good and spicy, and enough to take home for another meal but the chicken was rubbery and not the grilled fantasy you might have craved. Even the nice sauce wasn't enough to mask it's chewiness. The Prime Rib on NYE was decently spiced but even an end cut shouldn't be dry and still have marks where the jockey was beating it.\n\nThe batter they use for many things is good but... 8 medium to small onion rings for 6 bucks seemed a bit pricey for this \""Road House turn Tap Haus\"". The one thing I keep hearing is that the music is good. They have a semi regular band and we might go and check that out this evening.\n\nThey've got a TV crowd as they have plenty to watch games and even Fox News, and you can sit around the lower bar with chairs which is good if you're prone to falling off high stools. Although from my experience so far, the drinks won't make you that tipsy. Let's face it, my drink of choice for 30 years+ has been the Long Island Ice Tea and I've had them from Hawaii to New York City, Vancouver to Miami. A good one should taste good not \""alcoholy\"", but if after two you can still recite the Greek alphabet backwards in four seconds.....? It's probably not made with everything it should be and for the prices they get for that drink, you should get your money's worth. They do have a few decent wines and it's almost impossible to screw up a 7 & 7.\n\nIf you want beer beer beer... then you might like running the gauntlet of tap after tap. I'm not a beer person so other than a nice Corona on a hot day near a beach, i could care less but there's plenty of choices (nearly 100?) if you have a spare afternoon. You're sure to find something there that meets your  \""hops and barley\"" expectations.\n\nSo.. for now.. 3 (really 2 1/2) stars, as the place has enough to bring in the people (maybe expectations are going down in CC) but we'll see how a couple more visits work out as this is convenient, small enough to be comfortable and with outdoor seating the lunch experience is relaxing. We'll see as we'd like to see this place make it and even replace other \""really bad experiences\"" on the Cave Creek culinary trail. Time will tell....More later."
14319,2,"This is a happy hour review...\n\nOh for God's sake when will I ever learn?!?! Another rubber stamped FRC joint to blow my cash... FRC = decent quality, high service, and low value. \n\nCorn dogs at the fair are also overpriced, but ya know what? They're f'ing HOT. And f'ing FAST. And that dude with one tooth also asks me \""How are ya?\"" eight goddamn times. And they serve $6 beers, too. \n\nI give FRC credit for training their employees well, and at least I know they will not be closed in six months... and it's pretty inside, and there are cougars, and there was a clan of sherpa's rubbing my feet, and the tempura calamari is bitchin, and the Basil Gimlet was splendid (I had to have two, and the bartender graciously taught me how he made it), and the mac n cheese was dreamy at the bottom, but...  \n\nOh yeah... my check. And the cold mac that took like 17 minutes (although the bottom was hot). I sensed that it wanted to be really, really good... It was never given a shot at the heat, man... Oh and did I mention the check... Mac and cheese with andouille sausage for $9? I'm ok with that but serve it HOT or the specialty sausage that your chef's education conceived tastes like a microwaved hot dog gone cold. ...like Ma used to make (which is very comforting, don't get me wrong, but cost only sixteen cents). \n\nYou CAN judge a restaurant by the mac n cheese... Sometimes I am just as happy at the fair for $68... try somewhere beside Greene House at Kierland first."
25653,1,"My visit to Place Milton was an underwhelming experience. I went there looking for a lunch spot that would change from the usual places I go to on Sherbrooke around the St-Urbain Street area. Basically, you get something almost as expensive but less tasty than you would at Moulin Lafayette or Godley and Cr\u00e8me. I had an ordinary sandwich with boring fries. Breakfasts I saw on other tables did not seem any better. The place seems very popular with students. On the plus side, staff was friendly, filter coffee was good, they have a little patio, and the place has a large window in the front. Still, I don't plan to go back; there are several better lunch options around there."
26710,1,Went for the first time tonight. Did not like the feel or decor. Tons of tacky Easter decorations everywhere. Even without those decorations the bar had a creepy feeling to it. 3 bartenders all with there cell phones in hand texting. Did not eat but person next to me was eating and it looked good.
37471,4,This place is amazing. It has its own vibe that draws just the right crowd of misfit artists. You wont find a better place to spend an evening among art and artists.
39354,2,"Brio is A-OK. Really nice patio seating with great friendly service. The chopped salad was decent...fresh and well dressed. The eggplant pomodoro was ok...could hardly tell the cooked-to-death mush inside was once eggplant, but it was edible. The pasta it came with was very good, perfectly cooked with a very nice balance of garlic, seasoning, and oil. Next time, I'll have a simple pasta dish; they seem to know their pasta. The desserts were very good. I had the mocha pannacotta, and my friends had tiramisu and choc lava cake...all very, very good. \n\nI can't give it more than a solid 3-star rating (this review ain't bad overall...it's just that mushy low-flavor eggplant that's sticking in my craw...maybe when I go back I'll be able to push it to 4 stars if I'm a big fan of whatever I order then). Still, it's a decent enough eatery at a decent enough price to go back."
31604,0,"We travel all over the country and hit a Starbucks for our morning shot of Joe. The worst service of any Starbucks I've ever been in is a mile from our new home. Lucky me. I asked to speak to the manager but she doesn't come in until the afternoon. So, in the morning when the place is busiest the manager doesn't work. It shows in their level of service. Drive to another location, it's worth it."
22284,2,"Pub Crawl Stop 6 (finale):This spot is just down from my office and the only spot that I visited using the light rail for my light rail pub crawl. By this time I was completely hammered and although hungry, I didn't want to wait for the $5 special of burger, fries and domestic beer.  When you consider the domestic beer was $2, that's a good deal for the food - but I just ordered one domestic beer. I can't recall much about this place. I would like to go back when I am not so out of it because I have heard they have good food and great drink specials"
20168,3,"With faux-Tuscan arches accented by whimsical Italian maxims (Due Piedi Non Possono Stare In Una Scarpa--\""Two Feet Can't Fit In One Shoe\"") and fanciful chandeliers, The casino-side Grotto doesn't promise anything remarkable. So it's all the more impressive to discover it offers many common dishes uncommonly well done. \n\nWe got off to a good start with soft Italian bread with garlicked olive oil...Calimari Toto promises that you're getting all the octopus--authentically Italian--fresh but flavorful pieces of the tentacles and head, in a light egg batter that makes it hard to stop eating... meatballs come two near-baseballs to an order, a thin crust protecting the piping hot, almost pate-soft inside (which they claim is all flavorful beef chuck, though you'll suspect more tender veal). The Italian Chopped salad balances proscuitto, bacon, egg, with Gorgonzola and provolone cheeses with iceberg lettuce so deftly that the thin-sliced grilled chicken breast on top seems unncessary. \n\nChicken and seafood are clearly the strengths here (though they also make their own fresh pastas)...particularly the Roasted Herb chicken, a half-bird rotisseried with rosemary over white oak and nothing less than tender, savory perfection. \n\nBut the pizzas deserve equal attention, especially considering how few and far between are good pies found in the city. Grotto's hand-tossed rustic rounds, cooked in a wood burning stove in the middle of the dining room, taste just like you'd expect from a street caf\u00e9 in Napoli...but maybe a bit better. Our margherita, hitting the table in a cloud of aroma, didn't have a chance of survival. \n\nThe garlicky sweet marinara sauce that accompanies many dishes is the kind of recipe you could easily crave, fresh, simple yet deceptively complete. \n\nA small wine list offers a baker's dozen reds and ten whites by the glass, including their own robust chianti-esque Rock N Roll blend, totally acceptable.\n\nBeware that huge dessert cart--it will call you, with the signature featherlight wedding cake, dense and deadly chocolate mezza notte, respectable tiramisu, and certainly not least of all, a solid New York cheesecake with strawberry cream, impressively authentic.\n\nLunch diners get a voyeuristic view of action at The Tank pool deck, and a limited selection of their most popular items, augmented by some creative panini, and an old school \""Nugget\"" salad.\n\nI think they have good deals on the pizzas during happy hour."
27632,0,We waited two hours for our dinner.  They did not care! And even when we got our food it wasn't made to our taste. The waiters were running around like they didn't know what they were doing. I would never go there... Unless you want to starve.
97,3,Had lunch with my wife. The quality of the sushi was quite good. My wife had some tempura that was fabulous. Service was friendly and quick. We really enjoyed our lunch. We will be back.
30599,1,"I love the location, right across the street from my gym (LVAC).  I love the almost guilt free menu options.  (Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Rockin Raspberry Smoothie this trip).  I even love the deals they have at this location like buy 2 smoothies get one free from 4-7pm and their free junior all american wrap with purchase of a smoothie from 7-10am.  \n\nThe two star rating is spawned from the seemingly intolerable drive-thru wait time and service.  On this particular trip I decided to time my experience.  36 minutes total from line entrance to smoothie acquisition.  On top of that I was charged for 3 smoothies initially despite being well within the buy 2 get 1 free time window.  As a minor aside they also neglected to ask what sort of \""side\"" I wanted with my wrap.  I guess I sounded like a Baked Sour Cream and Onion chips kind of guy?  Perhaps management needs to hire additional staff or streamline his production process?  The young man that waited on me seemed pretty stressed out."
43412,1,"Came here for dinner while visiting family.\n\n- Food: Well, it IS a buffet. Sushi selection was terrible and everything was obviously not fresh. Hibachi steak was dry. My ice cream had freezer burn.\n+ Price: Cheap for a buffet\n+ Atmosphere: Typical Chinese buffet layout. Good for groups.\n- Service: Unprofessional. Waiters yelling across the room is not very pleasant.\n- Recommendation: Nope."
32867,3,Great experience here with the food and service. Our group ordered the chicken and waffles and this pork dish. When they say the portions are huge it's an understatement. The food was tasty and the service was friendly. Really glad I was able to try it.
3695,1,"Outback Steakhouse\nMultiple Locations\n\nWith all the hype and advertising it was only natural to try Outback. It was a Tuesday night, and we were seated immediately. We chose not to have anything from the bar, and instead stayed non-alcoholic for the evening.\n\nCompanion #1 ordered a bowl of potato soup. It arrived hot, with nice chunky potatoes sticking out of the soup along with large pieces of bacon. No complaints were heard. Companion #2 ordered the Cesar Salad. It seemed run of the mill, and companion noted that it was a bit heavy handed on the cheese.\nI ordered the regular salad with the honey mustard vinaigrette. This was a nicely done salad.\n\nFor main courses, companion #1 ordered a medium bacon cheeseburger. The burger arrived medium but on the dry side, with barely adequate cheese and decent fries. Companion felt she had had better burgers in most fast food places.\nCompanion #2 ordered the rib eye steak medium rare. It arrived medium rare, but seemed to be poorly prepped in that it had lots of sinew on it, and the tail still had some silverskin attached. Seasoning was adequate but nothing special.\nI had the Ahi tuna appetizer along with the small sirlion. The Ahi was cooked correctly, but had been pre-cooked hours before, and was greatly over-seasoned. By the time you added the wasabi vinaigrette dipping sauce, the fish had no taste left of its own. In paying for a premium fish like Ahi, the fish should be the central character, and the rest of the condiments are the supporting role. The petite sirloin was cooked as ordered (rare), but lacked flavor and again, still had silverskin attached, making the last piece memorable for its chewiness.\n\nWe did not order any deserts.\n\nInspection of the restrooms was pleasant enough, in that they were recently cleaned, smelled fresh, and looked nice.\n\nOverall, I might rate Outback 2.5 to 3 stars. I've definitely had better at lower prices. BTW if you are tempted by the Blossom, their signature onion and your on a diet, companion #1 says stay far away from it. That one dish alone will use up the entire days amount of points!"
47980,2,"New place, long wait, what else is new. If you are from Toronto, you would be used to lining up for ramen places though (but never really quite sure why...)\n\nThe ramen is standard kenzo, so noodle is a bit chewy. What I liked was that the stock wasn't too salty. Not sure if portion is too small or price is too high (again standard kenzo so not really directed to this particular restaurant).\n\nThe takoyaki was quite okay, a satisfying snack eat to end the meal on a good note.\n\nI would say this is a welcome addition to the plaza landscape, may be tempted to visit again on cold winter days."
18076,2,"the group i went with had a discount, so we only paid about $25/person for the all you can eat meat buffet.  (i think originally it's like $35/person, but i'm not 100% sure).\n\nso the price at 25 is good, if i had to pay 35/person this place woulda been more like a 2 or 2.5 star.\n\nbasically people walk around the tables holding different assortments of meat and if you like what u see, they carve a piece for you.\n\nthe meat is for the most part juicy, but i felt the \""salad bar\"" was quite sad and shouldnt be allowed to be called a salad bar.  i dont eat THAT much meat, so i didnt enjoy this as much as my male counterparts."

40107,1,"I was looking forward to eating here ever since learning they opened in my neighborhood.  It was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nWe arrived at 7:05 on a Saturday night, fully expecting there to be a wait. I don't mind waiting. This went beyond that.\n\n7:10 Server asked us if we were eating in. We said yes. The dining room was only about 60% full. A lady came from the back to inform us that there was a half hour wait for a table. We were a little confused, since there were sooo many tables open, but said of course we could wait. She looked REALLY put out that we chose to wait, even though it was 2 hours before closing. The server sat us in a booth, and asked us if we would like some water. We asked if we could have a coke? She brought them to us.\n\n7:35 Server took our order. One of our meals was supposed to come with a salad, which is usually served first.\n\n8:05 Server asked to take our order. We told her we had already given it. Still no salad.\n\n8:30 Lady who told us there was a wait asked to take our order. We told her we put it in an hour before and could we just get it to go? She actually grabbed a sign that was facing away from us and showed it to us; it said that it takes a half hour for food to be ready. Then she said, \""and I told you it was a half hour wait to get a table.\"" We were shocked. We had already been there nearly an hour and a half, and while definitely put out, we hadn't even complained. We wanted it to go so we could take it home because we had been there long enough and were tired. She said she would pack up our food to go, including salad and desert.\n\n8:45 Our food was brought out. We paid and left.\nI have to say it was a very degrading experience and we will never go there again. I understand that they may be understaffed, but how is it customer service to behave as we are being unreasonable because we have been waiting an hour and a half and want to take our food to go? The showing us the sign was a huge insult. I know how to tell time. I knew exactly how long we had been there. Good customer service is apologizing for the wait and giving a good excuse for it. The kitchen being a half hour backed up is no excuse for it being 1 hr 45 mins before our food arrived.\n\nWe never got the salad. It wasn't in the to-go food. I cannot recommend this restaurant. I'm sure they are very nice when they have under 10 customers, but they do not have the capability to handle a half full dining room on a Saturday night.\nThe food was ok. I'm sure it would have been delicious when fresh."
29099,0,"I figured I would write an update on this review since the waiter reached out and attempted to rebut the points in my review. Unfortunately all it did was change their review from 2 stars to one. \n\nThe waiter's comments are below. \n\nWaiter response to my original review - - - \""Hi, i waited to respond so i could look at your check for this day.\nFirst i apologize for your experience Lamb Seekh Kabob is served without skewers because they are metal ones and 5' long.\nWe have daily lunch specials which run from $8.95 to $11.95 , its complete lunch and comes with everything. Lunch specials combo of two dishes is only $2.95 additional. \nWe cannot compare Indian restaurant with Chinese restaurant.\nTips were voluntary.\nWe will surely look into our prices compared to other Indian restaurants.\nThanks\""\n\nMy response to this is...\n\nI followed your lead when ordering our meal from beginning to end... I trusted you... if you had options that could have SIGNIFICANTLY reduced our bill, why was there absolutely no mention of this during my 90 minute lunch?!\n\nI originally thought the service and food was good, but meal was overpriced compared to what we received. Instead, apparently the service was not good. You seem to have let me pay $13+ for each meal plus an additional $3 for rice and $3 for nan when we could have gotten much more for a lesser price (and likely left very satisfied). We trusted you to guide us to good food, not just good food that would pad the bill at a la carte prices. In the future, you may want to guide your customers to your specials."

15900,2,"1st off the decor of the restaurant was nice and the staff was friendly. The restaurant itself was smaller than I thought it would be and had 2 main dining areas. It was pretty busy when we went but didn't seem overcrowded like in most Dim Sum restaurants.\n\nThe food at PPP is decent. We had the dim sum staples like Har Gow, Shaomai, Beef Balls and fried shrimp balls. Nothing really stood out from the dishes we had. In addition there didn't seem to be too much variety in the dishes. We had asked the servers if the Chinese Broccoli and Sesame Balls were coming out and they said soon. 3 passes later with the carts and those 2 dishes were MIA. And this is at 12 during the middle of lunch? I didn't get it. \n\nOne other thing that was a turn off is the fact that it is located in the casino and is open where you are exposed to the smoke lingering from the casino.\n\nI have to say that I was a little disappointed after eating here. I had heard such good reviews on it but in the end I would have rather have eaten at Orchids Garden. It was a nice change but I would have to say that I will not be back."

10542,4,"Vegas has a gazillion restaurants to choose from, so the list of places that I want to visit is quite extensive. I definitely knew that wanted to go to a place that would have more locals than tourists. After running through my list and seeing the great Yelp reviews, I finally decided on India Palace.\n\nWow, I was not disappointed! Started the meal off with the Vegetable Pakora and the Onion Bhaji. The Onion Bhaji, which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep fried, was amazing!!! It had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with, and when I felt like upping the spice meter, I just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce. I don't know the name of that sauce, but you know, the one that burns your mouth off.\n\nI went for my usual Chicken Vindaloo for my main course. Chicken Vindaloo is chicken cooked in a hot spicy sauce with diced potatoes, and of course, you can request the level of spiciness. I went for \""hot\""! To die for... it was sooo good!!! It was so spicy that I started sweating while eating it....yeah, that's some good shit! I gobbled this down with some garlic naan and cheese naan, and was quite full. I didn't even have room for dessert, which is usually required in my book.\n\nWhen I checked in, I unlocked a Yelp coupon code, which they pleasantly honored. The service was absolutely awesome! Nice, quick, and always a smile.\n\nWill be going back!"
17962,3,"Well this was the buffet that took my virginity since it was the first one I went to in Vegas.  I was very impressed by the d\u00e9cor and the size.

So refreshing. \n\nWhy do I make your fries so limp, baby? If I could change one thing about you, sugar, just crisp up those fries...

21748,1,"The only reason I am giving this restaurant two stars is because the food is good.  Otherwise, I am repulsed by how bad the service is.  In such an upscale restaurant,  I expect more from the wait staff.  We waited for approximately 10 minutes before bread (4 slices) was brought to our table.  When we asked for more, we didn't get it until after our food arrived.  Once the food arrived, we cut into the steak and the waiter asked if we needed anything else. We never saw him again until 15 minutes after we were done eating.  We had dirty dishes on the table until we got our check, and the pen that they wanted me to sign the check with was covered in oil that was given to the table to dip the bread in.... \nHORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!"
31208,1,"I'm torn on this rating.  Two stars is \""Meh, I've experienced better.\"", and I have.  Three stars is \""A-OK\"", which it  was.  \n\nHad the manager not compensated me for the ridiculously small plate of ribs I got, this review would be scathing.  But he did make it mostly right and that went a long way towards fixing the overall experience to a third star.  But two things about the third star:  I shouldn't have to feel like a cheapass by wondering if I got a full rack or a half rack.  The food didn't feel like anything special, which would have been acceptable if the prices were far lower.   \n\nTwo stars it is.  \n\nOur party arrived on a Friday night--we were in the area, a little lost for a good place to go.  I remembered this place as a good hangout spot on a weekday night, which it definitely is.\n\nTonight, we were seated promptly and never waited very long for anything--the service was fast and top-notch.   However, i'm having difficulty with this whole hipster thing where the wait staff dresses in  street clothes.  It weirds me out and it's almost insulting for as expensive as the place is.  \n\nI totally dig the overall ambience.  The restaurant itself appears to be in a rehabbed auto mechanic's shop, creating something totally unique in a region of unique rehabs.  The comfortable patio hangs right off Central Avenue, creating a rare big-city kinda place in Phoenix.  The fire pit is just cool, they play good and fun music.   Ambience is about the one thing about this place that actually lines up with the price, contributing solidly to Uptown's burgeoning vibe.\n\nThe beer selection felt weak.  We didn't order cocktails, so I can't comment on that.  \n\nGoing through our courses....The potstickers were good, but the thai peanut sauce just tasted weird.  The spicy edamame was an interesting twist but I didn't find myself very hungry for it   My friend ordered the cajun burger which he thought was \""mediocre.\""  I ordered what turned out to be the smallest full rack of ribs in Arizona described above--the mango to the sauce was too slight leaving it fairly generic, altho the fries and slaw were pretty good.   The meat, yeah I wolfed it down, but in the end it didn't seem like anything to write home about.  \n\nThe food and drink, all in all, felt more or less average.  The problem with average is in how much this place charges--I'm not going to give three stars to an expensive restaurant that serves three star food.     Given the other choices in the area that I still need to try out, I don't see much of a reason to come back for dinner again."
30612,4,"Best place and people EVER!!! Andy the head chef is absolutely amazing the nicest person you can ever meet.

Now I love sushi and don't mind when my wife asks to come here, I actually ask her now to come!! BEST BEST PLACE EVER!!!!"
44902,1,"This restaurant was my third stop on my Gordon Ramsay tour (Steak, Burgr, Pub).\n\nKind of a disappointment. The beer, wine, and overall drink selection was nothing special. Average, at best. The food was just OK and definitely not worth the price.\n\nService was just okay. The staff was friendly, but slow and hard to flag down. We constantly felt like we were waiting. Waiting for drink orders, waiting for drinks, waiting for food orders, waiting for other drink orders, waiting for drinks we ordered that never showed up, and waiting for dessert. It was ridiculous.\n\nI had a shot at a few beers, scallops, short rib, scotch egg, steak, and of course the sticky toffee.\n\nThe scallops were abysmal. I've paid half the cost and received twice as many, better prepared. Two people ordered scallops at our table and both orders were bad. They were so sandy that it felt like I threw a handful of sand in my mouth and started chewing. One order seemed overcooked. Would not have this again at this restaurant.\n\nThe short rib, while tender, seemed lackluster in flavor. As with the scallops, I have had much more flavorful short rib for a fraction of the price elsewhere. I would not order this again at this restaurant.\n\nThe steak was nothing special, honestly, and I felt was about twice as costly as necessary for what it was.\n\nThe scotch egg was actually very good. Probably one of the better/best scotch eggs I've had. I would order this again.\n\nThe sticky toffee was great, and I would order it again. One of the best desserts I have ever had.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this place. You can get similar or better food at a plethora of other restaurants, for a fraction of the price. If I were Gordon Ramsay I would be appalled at how this restaurant is executing."
23585,1,"Ohhh I wanted to like it! We live in Henderson, so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- I had to offer to pay LOL so off we went. I ordered NY Street Dog, waffle fries & BBQ Western Burger w/bacon. I have to admit when the food got to the table, in the cute little bar style baskets -- I turned to my roommate and said \""disgusting\"". It was so gross, to me (and I'm from the west coast) but it was all Chicago style -- like a mess. It wasn't the type of food you can just pick up and eat, the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated, wet, soggy, mushy like dough like gross - which is where my \""disgusting\"" game from. So the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog, like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled. It was not a good, high quality hot dog at all. What I didn't like was it was all pink - inside and out I don't know I like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside. This dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard. I bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate. He cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing, and I wanted to take a picture but I felt silly - it was a big piece of mush. Seriously like \u00be of it had been dipped in BBQ sauce........... It seems like the BBQ burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with BBQ/Chili sauce. I took a bite, the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and I did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the BBQ sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess, yucky - I set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the \""natural\"" fries, which ya, were very greasy. We ate all of the fries, because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good  some kind of Cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter.\n\nLike I said I wanted to like this place, I like the d\u00e9cor and the waitress was very nice but this place is not my style. I'll continue on my personal search for a great Las Vegas burger."
22056,0,I want to start off by saying I didn't attend the Luau. I stayed at the IP during a very big convention and couldn't find rooms anywhere else.  I had the privilege of seeing people get ripped off from my rooms balcony.  The show was the same thing you can see at the Hawaiian Market place across the street from the City Center for FREE. For the money that those idiots paid they could have eaten at the best buffet or restaurant.
9727,0,"I am the founder of a tech startup and a regular visitor to Vegas (50+ times). I was late booking my travel to this year's CES conference (January 2015), so had limited options for hotels on/near the strip. I've stayed at nearly all the hotels on the strip, but for this trip the best option from a cost and location standpoint seemed to be Rio. This was my first booking here. \n\nTotal nightmare. They didn't have my room ready, and finally instead of a Deluxe King room I was put into an older double bed room. It was 40 degrees in Vegas and the heater was broken in my room. I called Maintenence three times to no avail, and finally went down to the front desk to speak with a manager myself. The customer service rep, Joanna, was rude and unhelpful. She told me I would just have to sleep in the cold. The manager, William, said it was a hotel-wide problem, with no heat in any rooms. For $350/night that is unacceptable. He said he couldn't move me to any other room and offered me $30 for the inconvenience. $30?.... A credit for my stay would be more suitable. Aside from the maintenance and check-in issues, the demeanor and lack of professionalism from the staff was very upsetting. I have never seen that before here in Vegas, where hotels staffs' typical bend over backwards to ensure you have an incredible stay. \n\nI will not stay at the rio again and do not recommend it. Stay at MGM, Palms, or Mandalay Bay for the same price. Or pay more for the Wynn, Palazzo, Bellagio or Venetian."
32520,0,"Like most people, I went to the drive thru. I ordered a Daily Double meal like usual. I went to the 1st window and the cashier said, \""You got Daily Double, no onion, pickle or mustard?\"" No, I got the Daily Double with all of the fixins-- thanks for assuming *rolls eyes.* I get my order and I realized that I got the wrong drink. Instead of getting a Sprite, I got a Coke. I quickly walked back over and asked them if I could quickly get my Sprite. The worker was less than nice and took his sweet damn time getting me a Sprite. All along I saw what I believed to be a regular Sprite right in front of me. I asked him if that's mine and he's like, \""uhhh...no.\"" So I get my cup, totally relieved-- then I noticed that the cup felt light. I opened the cup to see that it wasn't even filled all of the way and with little ice and no bubbles. Hmm...a clear liquid with no bubbles; does that sound like Sprite to you? No, and it wasn't. It was water (not even cold too). So now I am pissed because I told this punk politely for Sprite at least TWICE. So I go into the restaurant and get it replaced. Then the manager asked me if I got my order and I said yes. Now I'm thinking that my meal is also wrong. I go back into my car to find they did give me the wrong meal. I went back into the restaurant FOR THE THIRD TIME to get my meal. All awhile customers are pitying me saying, \""They really screwed that up, didn't they?\"" No fucking shit.\n\nBy the time I ate my burger, I lost my apetite.The competency of this staff is beyond disappointing. I am definitely going to another McDonalds if not another restaurant because of this."
14813,3,"I'm really surprised this place has such a low rating!\n\nWe were giving a \""2 for 1 entree\"" coupon, and decided to come find The Cafe in the Monte. We were staying at Vdara, so we needed some food options! Very clean, great menu choices. Our server was great. Fast/Nice - but down to business. I like them like that, not too friendly.\n\nI was torn between a lot of menu choices - but went with the Chicken Fried Steak + Scrambled Eggs + Toast + Hashbrowns! All for a price of 12.99. The steak & gravy was AMAZZZZINGGGGGG. I was very impressed. Husband ordered the Ham/Sausage/Cheddar omelette and it was good. \n\nWe really enjoyed our meal here because we enjoy our time in the Monte. We decided that even if we didn't have the special deal, we would probably come back here!"
17780,2,"The following is a detailed review of the Tropicana Cinemas, a subsidiary of Regency Theaters.  My husband and I visited the cinema for the first time for a Saturday 7 p.m. showing of Captain America 2.  The theater and our auditorium were busy, with approximately 70 - 80 seeing the show.\n\nWe thought the (P)Leather seats were comfortable, clean and well maintained.  A repeat customer commented on the fact that there were new seats in the theater (we were in Auditorium #3).  I like the pleather seats much better than cloth and the seats rocked back and a nice incline.  Seat rows are not too close.  There is only one auditorium and no upper and lower levels.  The minus with the seats is that the back is high.  Since the theater floor does not incline that much, this means that anyone standing up in front of you will block the screen and/or shorter guests (children) might have a hard time seeing the screen.  That's probably why I noticed a very large stack of booster seats in the lobby.\n\nThere are five auditoriums.  When the lobby is busy, you can hear noise from the congestion in that area.  Theater has one box office window.  At the time of this writing, tickets were $2.00 each ($1.00 on Tuesdays) and $3.50 for 3D showings.  Tickets for this theater cannot be purchased online.\n\nUpon purchasing a ticket, you enter the doors on the right.  There is one security/ticket taker stand, and a small concessions area.  The security person does request to look inside women's purses. \n\nThe sign at the Security Stand states:  \""No Outside Food or Drink - CASH ONLY.\""  Bag Policy:  No shopping bags, no trash bags, no luggage bags, and no large bags of any kind.  All hand bags, side bags and purses brought into the Tropicana Cinemas are subject to search.   Staff and management reserve the right to refuse any and all bags.  We cannot hold any items for any reason.  You may enter the building 20 minutes prior to the show.  Ticket sales are no longer available 20 minutes after start of show.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  Not responsible for items left in theaters.  These policies apply to everyone.  No Exceptions.\""\n\nThe prices at the concession stand are not discounted and most items are comparable to a regular movie theater.   I know from my days working at a movie theater that the box office money goes to the movie makers and the concession stand goes to the theater, so see why prices are high.    There is one long line for concessions.\n\nPrices at the time of this writing for concessions:\n\nPOPCORN:\nLarge Popcorn (free refill) - $6.26, Medium Popcorn - $5.25, Small Popcorn $4.25.  Combo #1 (Family Combo) - $19.75 [two large drinks, one large popcorn, one nachos].\n\nCOMBOS:\nCombo #2 - $18.00 [2 Icee, 1 Nachos, 1 Pretzel].  Combo #3 - $15.25 [two large drinks, one large popcorn].  Combo #4 - $11.50 [one super nachos, one large drink] / All combos come with your choice of a free Sour Jacks or Muddy Bears Candy.  \n\nKIDS COMBOS:\nOne kids tray of popcorn, one 12 ounce soda and one kid's candy is $5.00 (if purchasing the Kid's combo with an Icee, then it's $5.75).\n\nDRINKS:\nLarge Drink (free refill) - $4.50, Medium Drink -$4.00, Small Drink - $3.50.  Icee - $4.75, Large Water - $4.00, Small Water - $3.00\n\nCANDY:   $2.75, $3.50, and $3.75\n\nSNACKS:  $1.00 for Hot Dogs (Eisenberg brand); Pretzels\n\nThe lobby in general is congested.  There is an ATM machine present along with many arcade games.  The lobby is the center hub for accessing the five auditoriums as well as the men's and women's restrooms - a lot of activity in a small place.  The restrooms were clean (trash not emptied as typical at most movie theaters).  Place in general is old but clean and maintained.\n\nOn the theater's Weekly Movie Guide, they advertise a \""Reward Program.\""  However, when we inquired about this, we were told that the Reward Program does not apply to this location.  However, you can sign up for e-mails about future screenings or download the Regency Cinemas phone app for show times.  Theater can also be \""liked\"" on Facebook.  Group rates and rentals are also available; call (702) 248-7469 for details.\n\nThree previews were shown prior to the show.  There were a lot of people talking loudly at the beginning of the movie, but finally stopped after the first five minutes. Also, there was a small line of late arrivers up to 5 minutes after the movie started, and an usher helped seat them. The Manager was visible several times, seen standing in the lobby.\n\nThis theater is truly \""discounted\"" if you live in the area and if you don't purchase from the concession stand.  However, if you have to drive far or if you purchase from concessions, then there isn't that big of a savings.  For us, we missed a general run of a blockbuster movie but still wanted to see it on the big screen.   Thank goodness this theater was not \""ghetto fab\"" but just too far for us, as we will return occasionally.  Most people would probably enjoy this entertainment option."
23480,1,glad I only had coffee.  meh..
49988,3,This place is a trip to morocco! Try the tea and the date shake. The bread is awesome. The owner is a gracious host and gave us a bunch of stuff to try. I love the decorations in the place too! A fun trip out
37498,2,"Mixed feelings on this place. I called to see how long and how much to fix my cracked iPhone 5 screen. The guy said about 20-30 minutes and that it would be $90 (plus $5 off for the yelp deal and I could do the $30 for $55 if I bought it on yelp). Got there and he said I can't do both the deals and that now yelp was \""updated\"" to have a $35 for $55 deal, even though mine didn't show that. I ended up paying $87 with tax and he said it would take 90 minutes!!! \n\nI was irritated by then but needed my screen fixed so I agreed and left. Went and and ran some errands with my mom and decided to just go back and sit and wait, even though it has only been about 40 minutes. As soon as I got there he gave me my phone right away...just had me wondering how long they would have had me waiting since I never got a phone call. \n\nBesides all of that, my phone looks great and brand new again!!"
8206,1,"Don't come here before 10 pm on a Friday night unless you want to listen to old ladies singing oldies songs. We were a fun group that stopped in at 8:30ish to listen to some karaoke, and it was a disaster. A bunch of blue hairs reliving their glory days and terrorizing the ears of everyone in the restaurant. I'll come back here when I'm 60. The service was also pretty bad, I remember looking back to find out server and just saw her sitting at the bar top doing nothing. On a Friday night in a bar? Really lady?"
39285,2,"Buddy and I popped in here prior to a concert at the Fillmore. We were surprised at the large amount of seating, and the giant picnic tables are really awesome. Personally I was excited to see they had Ass Clown Brewery on tap because I had not tried them yet. So I got a pint of that and boy was it good! I paired it with a brat on pretzel roll. The brat itself was very bland, lacking almost any flavor. The pretzel roll it came on was amazing though, very warm and soft. I will probably come again if a band I want to see is playing and ill try something else for food. My friend said his burger was really good."
14675,2,"eh. meh.  the fog of the casino did not divert my attention from the price tag of these generic fusion versions of chinese food.  the dim sum was actually pretty good, but everything else was sort of greasy and white-ified.  oh also, restaurants that don't have windows toward the actual outside sort of creep me out."
14558,4,"My reviews are coming all at once because I suddenly had one of those urges to.. yelp my days away :D I promise that my reviews will be a bit more consistent from here on out :)\n\nAnyways, I loved this place.  Although I've eaten at a lot of fine dining restaurants, I felt like I was a bit intimidated at Le Cirque by all its glory (yes, I gave it a 5), but I felt relaxed when I was at Ogden.  EVERYTHING about it was just.. perfect!  I sound like some blond cheerleader..\n\nNaturally, the decor in fine dining places at the Vegas strip is beautiful- pretty modern and never outdated.  Ogden's is no exception.  Surrounded by warm woods and soft lighting, it is a stark contrast from restaurants like the metal jungle Shibuya at MGM Grand and Barmasa at the Aria.\n\nMy family and close friends (party of 7), went there one night with reservations, and it was amazing.  The service was indefatigable, being able to put up with the demands of my mother, and even I could tell that she was a bit intimidated by the ambiance of the whole place.  The front of house serves traditionally- starting with the ladies going clockwise and then the men.  Serving dishes from the left, taking them from the right, everything was like clockwork.  Fancy, fancy...\n\nThe manager greeted us after the server took our drink order, which is always a warm touch to any dining experience.  The drink I got was recommended by the server- a sparkling chardonnay.  NO IT WAS NOT CHAMPAGNE, people keep telling me that, holy crap.. it's not.  It was amazing and totally out of this world.\n\nAside from the 5 choices of bread that kept me full, I got a caesar salad which was good- it didn't taste like Walmart salad, but it didn't dance in my mouth- I mean, what do you expect from a salad?\n\nThe main course I got was Alaskan halibut (Alaskan halibut, an endangered species at a restaurant whose chef seems like one of those green peace dudes?  yeah, shut up).\n\nI expected it to be bland because that's how halibut is naturally, but I was very surprised.  Slightly tangy, it was accompanied by some greens.  It wasn't filling, but are main courses in fine dining restaurants supposed to make you feel bloated?  Anyways, you can tell from the flavor and the pairings of the ingredients in the halibut that this came from a chef who was still a true gourmand chef at heart.. unlike some (ahem, Mr. Puck).\n\nThe menu is purely organic and constantly changes with each season.  When you eat in the summer, you won't see the same dish in the winter, nor will you see it in the summer the year after.  The diversity and evolving nature of this restaurant is the reason I gave it a 5-star.\n\nThe website tells you that it is traditional American, but I call it contemporary.  I don't see anything traditionally American in Atlantic diver scallops in .. coconut curry.\n\nA dinner for two there is very appropriate- they even have a bar nearby to bring your buddies to.  Don't bring your children or toddlers- you don't want to make the angelic waitstaff turn bitter on you, if it's possible.  Otherwise, it's amazing."
11556,4,Best advice for de'lucas is to get there early if you want a weekend breakfast.  We got there at 8am on a Saturday and waited for about 5 minutes.  We did some shopping on the strip and we we passed again at 10 there was a huge line waiting to get in.  Our food was fresh and delicious.   All the toast and French toast is made from fresh Mancini bread.  Pancakes were awesome too.  Service is fast and friendly for how busy they are.  Get here early and make a nice little morning out of it like we did.
28275,4,"I am rough on my heels--at least a mile long trip, multiple times a day, over asphalt, sidewalk, and tile. Needless to say, I've destroyed a few heels before the rest of the shoe was ready to call it quits. \n\nEnter Tony's. I took 5 pairs there on Saturday and all were repaired in no time! Tony was even so nice to see whether a stain could be removed from a pair of nude pumps--no charge! The new heels matched the shoe color and all look almost as good as new! $10 per pair, cash only. \n\nNow I can spend my money on some fun shoes! Thanks, Tony's!"
6744,4,"I don't live \""close\"" to a Whole Foods (I'm south side Indy-they are north side Indy), but I go when I need some quinoa or to grab some lunch if I am in the area. I needed some quinoa, was driving by, so I stopped, even though I am not from Madison. With the Yelp check in you get a free small bag. .They were out of the small, so I got the next size up. Yay! I would have even paid the $.20 difference. Yay for good customer service!!!"
38272,0,"I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up."
5542,2,"The food was very good, old school the garlic toast and homemade thousand island dressing were very nostalgic.  The 2x baked potato was huge and the steak was excellent, but the bathrooms!  Please do something about them, it hurt the experience of an otherwise nice Friday night!"
66,0,Worst climbing gym I have ever been to. Customer service was a joke. Wall appears as if a boy scout went ham with a few sheets of plywood back in the 80s and then did nothing since then. Holds are prehistoric and grimy. Setting is subpar. Insurance doesn't allow for people who can't belay to be belayed? Better off climbing the outside of the building for a good pump..
26872,3,"The tortillas alone could make this place. \n\nI went at 12:30pm - got food and a table right away. I got the bean and cheese burrito with a side of guacamole. Everything was excellent and fresh. But the highlight, as mentioned, were the tortillas. They appeared to be homemade. And they were incredible.\n\nThe menu is limited, but also cheap. So I don't really see room for complaints there. The house the restaurant lives in is cute and cozy feeling.\n\nI liked this place even more when I learned that America was the name of the owner and not some cheesy restaurant title."
11115,0,"honestly, this place sucked.  here's why.  I've NEVER left an italian restaurant hungry until I went to casa di amore.  The seating was ridiculous.  my wife and I were sitting so close to other guests, that we could've eaten off of their plates.  I had hopes in the \""homemade\"" noodles only to be let down.  Couldn't tell the difference between that and store bought.  Not to mention, I ordered chicken alfredo, right?  I could have literally held the amount that they served me in the palm of my hand.  I had like 5 or 6 cubes of chicken in my pasta. It was pathetic and didn't taste any better than the $1 crap I could've bought in the wal-mart frozen food section.  I paid over $20 for a $2 dish.  The italian ristorante to the west or the sicilian ristorante to the east beats this place by leaps and bounds, no question, and they don't treat you like cattle.  Let this be a lesson to you casa di amore, stop screwing your customers."
9361,1,"It's pretty harsh for me to give 2 stars, but read on.\n\nI'm an explorer.  I look for things to do with our young son when traveling. As a result, I have been to many children's museums.\n\nHalf of the freaking exhibits don't work, are broken, or just suck in general.   It's only two floors.  Vegas could support four floors easily. \n\nThe gift shop is great if you're 4.   \n\nThe fat trick at the front counter was on the phone arguing with her husband (?) as the other girl checked us in.  My son went to look around the corner and see inside the museum. She stopped arguing long enough to yell at him to STAY WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD AT ALL TIMES.  \n\nRight in front of her, I told him, \""IGNORE HER.  You are not mentally retarded nor handicapped. We haven't lost you yet and it's been almost 9 years.  Feel free to EXPLORE. \""   O_o\n\nShe just looked at me."
36166,3,"Awesome Mac & Cheese!\n\nSITREP\n\nI have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.\n\nTHE MAC MENU\n\nMac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate \""Classic American Eats\"", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!\n\nSPECIAL PREPARATION!\n\nBFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of \""cheesification\"".

31751,2,Ive been here a couple times. I think the drinks are too expensive for a neighborhood bar. . . Food is decent nothing special but not bad. . . Service is always really friendly if not always prompt and on point.
41753,4,"Just getting back on a bike after many, many years. Great to have a bike shop that takes the time to answer questions and give advice because they want you to do it right. Did not buy my bike from them but they treated me as if I had. Great service and rider support."
47260,0,"My son walked into this barber shop, no one bothered to greet or acknowledge him. They looked at him after already being in there for five minutes and told him to sign in. Not welcoming, terrible customer service."
15357,3,"About time I write about the monstrously monstrous monster sandwich. My first picture on yelp is me eating this monstrosity.\n\nI usually make a stop here pretty much every single time I come to Vegas. Or ask people to come here to pick up food for me to go when they leave. Why? PASTRAMI.\n\nI'm not sure what's in their pastrami, but it's like crack to me. I'll eat maybe their large sandwich worth, and then take another side of pastrami to go, for myself to make some regular sized yummy sandwiches after. The pastrami is well seasoned, with a nice peppercorny crust, and just enough marbling and fattiness to give you that juicy and chewy but tender texture. \n\nI don't even eat the bread or bother to put mustard on the sandwich. I just go about taking a fork to pastrami to mouth. OM NOM NOM NOM.\n\nThe sandwich is really a decent value for 13.95, if you take it home. If you end up just tossing the sandwich cause you don't feel like carrying it, don't come here. Splitting the sandwich (3$) is a good idea if you're not taking it home. \n\nTheir other food is just OK. Nothing really to be highlighted, honestly, corned beef is pretty dry in comparison. \n\nI keep tempting myself to get the reuben, but something about the mound of cheese on top of meat and bread looking like a big sand dune scares me a little bit.\n\nYeah, service is off, sometimes. Yeah, the sandwich is grossly oversized for a lot of people. For me, it's just eat what I can, take out, and eat later.\n\n4 stars - Pastrami is the ultimate, everything else here falls short however. Come here on your last day of Vegas, as you will have leftovers to take home."
40470,4,"Sensational! \n\nBruntsfield does it again! La Barantine serves up absolutely sensational sandwiches and their pastries, sublime. I had a pistachio macaroon and was blown away by its taste!\n\nOnly very small inside so if walking past and you see a free table inside, grab it!!!!"
8517,0,"By far the worst sushi restaurant in town. I have been there 3 times, to be fair and give it a chance to change my mind. Each time the sushi has been dull, flavorless, and completely over priced. The service is so-so, and the menu would be impressive it the sushi had any quality to it at all. I have eaten many types of  good sushi and have never been so disappointed by the quality of food. For $14.00 I expect far more than some stale crab, limp rice, and over salted dipping sauce. Unfortunately, there are far better sushi places in town, such as Stingray and Kobe Tepan. Don't waste your time or money on Sushi 101"
36131,4,"I can't say enough about Studio Mixx, It is truly an amazing workout experience. I had always been interested in doing pilates and yoga but since I feel like I need to do cardio, I never signed up for a yoga/pilates class.\n\nSo when I was about to startup running again after not running for 3-4 months and gaining 20-25 pounds, my hairstylist gave me a free weeks pass to Studio Mixx where she works out, and since she said it is pilates, Yoga, AND cardio I had to try it out since I know the benefits of yoga/pilates.\n\n5 stars all the way. The 4 different classes all challenge you immensely and Shandi the owner knows exactly what she is doing and how to change things up in all the classes to keep your muscles guessing, and the cardio is intense as well. Being able to incorporate Yoga and pilates with cardio in a one hour class has been so rewarding for me and am so happy I can work so much of my body in such a short time period. I used to run 3-5 miles 5-6 days a week when I was in shape before, and I still make it out for runs like once a week and after running for 30-60 mins I barely break a sweat and feel pretty unsatisfied now that I am a regular at Studio Mixx. And running for 30-60 mins is pretty intense in its own right.\n\nThere are a lot of regulars, but there are also a lot of people who come to try it out and never see again because it is a tough workout. Once you make it through the first week or two, you will become addicted to coming and won't seem quite as tough, but it still will be. And you will see great results, guaranteed."
43869,2,"Rated #1 by USA magazine food was great although for the price I felt it should of been a little better and lot more selection. The seafood was just great and fresh, the meat section lamb and steak my favorite. The Asian selection was not enough and the Italian section was really lacking they only had 1 pasta dish where is the rest? \n\nThe dessert was just amazing love everything that alone will come back for :) \n\nLove the setting and ambience not your average buffet.  \n\nIf you have the money to splurge then go but if not you can go to other  buffets and have more selection."
2808,1,"Waited an hour for a flu shot... Ridiculous\nI came after a suggestion from walgreens that it was cheaper and easier there. This was not true. My time is worth more than a $7 discount. Also staff was not impressive, massive bruise the morning after from adjusting the needle in my muscle. Will not return."
34742,2,"Came here in the Casino's... no room.\n\nVery old so it does smell like cigarettes like every casino but even worse... not as bad as Flamingo, but still bad. It's between Paris and Flamingo.\n\nI got a feeling that Bally's caters to older adults - close to the retiring age because I saw lots of them when I came in here."
16899,2,"A cafe that was slightly bigger. Fast to order because line wasn't that long, but a lot of people were eating here. It is a cheaper option compared to the other restaurants at Wynn. \n\nFood came slow since it was made to order. \nI got the soup and 1/2 sandwich combo. The clam chowder soup I got was good on the flavor and seems healthier since didn't seem like cream/milk was put into it, but it was on the cold side. I wished it was hotter. The turkey sandwich was meh, not that good. The mayo didn't help with the flavoring much so i used the horseradish to up the flavor. Way too much meat on the sandwich so i took out most of it. I was hungry, so i had to eat it."
27814,3,"So I stopped at Daily Dose before heading to Sedona and it was the perfect place to get a hearty breakfast before a hike. There were a lot of people there but they seated pretty fast. The patio is spacious and has a really relaxing vibe for being in downtown Scottsdale. \n\nI ordered the prime rib Benedict which was awesome and the breakfast nachos, which is more food than anyone should eat before 10am. The fruit that came on the side didn't taste very fresh and the roasted potatoes had cumin on them which kind of threw me off. The prime rib was tender and the hollandaise sauce was on point. Breakfast nachos had this really good queso dip and the salsa was light and fresh--truly enjoyed this dish a lot. \n\nOur server was super nice and the food came out fast. Parking is easy to find, it's right around the building and has a three hour limit."
40870,3,"Had an absolutely fabulous Cobb salad for brunch--one of the best Cobb's I've ever had (that might sound like faint praise, but they're harder to do well than you might think).  The vinaigrette was superb.  Definitely coming back.  The service was quick, even for Sunday brunch, and we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  Loved it!"
18720,0,Very unhelpful and rude. I sat down with Francisco Ramirez to go over details of my account. I didn't have a debit card so he asked for two forms of ID. I handed him two STATE issued IDs and he said that would not work (iv never heard of that) it was an Arizona ID and my state drivers license. I has to go to my car and get my business license. After that he was rushed and very short and rude and my problem wasn't resolved. He just told me to call the number on the back of my card for better luck. Never coming back to this branch again.
37425,3,"This is my go to spot for car washes. Once upon a time I used to hand wash my car all the time. I don't have time for that anymore. I also don't have a bunch of cash sitting around to pamper my car with fancy car washes. \n\nI've heard from plenty of car wash owners and friends that the brushes at the cheap automated car washes such as these are not too good for the finish and paint of your car. So as awesome as these reviews are, if you have a newer car  or your Honda rice rocket is your pride and joy, pay the extra money. For everyone else, like me, this place is the best. \n\nMy car is always looking fly and my friends always compliment how the inside is so clean. This location will always have a special place in my heart since it was the first time I even ever did an automated car wash, I'm like a little kid looking around and watching everything."
2144,0,"I went to Ulta in Desert Ridge and was really disppointed.  I came in to get my hair trimmed about forty-five minutes before they closed.  When I came in there were two stylists sitting in the waiting area talking to the receptionist.  They asked if I had an appointment (I didn't) and then told me they couldn't take me so late, which was fine.   Then one of the stylists, an older gentleman, found it necessary to lecture me for a good five minutes on how late it was, which I thought was terribly rude.  It's a shame, because I work and live very close and was hoping to find a good salon in my area."
11948,3,"I stopped in here when I was vacationing in LV last weekend, and it was probably the food-highlight of the trip.  I had the Kobe beef burger with peppered jack cheese, caramelized onions, and the typical burger toppings.  It was fantastic.  The onion rings were also delicious, and the bloody mary I had was hands-down the best I've ever drank.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to visit this place again on my next trip (considering how many places there are to eat in Vegas,) but it's definitely worth checking out if you're close-by."
42090,1,I only went here because my normal breakfast spots were really busy. Found the staff fairly rude and not very helpful. The food was overpriced for what it was. Coffee was bad restaurant coffee (brown water). There are much better breakfast options in town. I will likely not eat here again.
7509,3,This place has been here forever and every few years I like to come in for dessert. I had the James Dean Sundae. Very good creamy ice cream and tasty Caramel. The waitress was pleasant and friendly enough. Didn't try any food as this really is a place for ice cream desserts with the feel of an old fashioned parlor. Beats Dairy Queen hands down for a few more $$$ and more relaxing than any of the chains like Cold Stone Creamery or B&R.
39398,3,"My first experience with a firehouse sub wasn't so pleasant, so when this one popped up in the neighborhood, it took a while to go in and try it again.  What a surprise, it was actually good!\n\nI got the Turkey Bacon Ranch.  It has smoked turkey breast, bacon, and sharp cheddar cheese with peppercorn ranch to finish it off.  The bread was fresh, the turkey was moist and tender, and the bacon crisp.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  \n\nService is not bad, they make it when you order, serve it when it's ready, and you self serve your own drink, the place is clean and is more spread out than my first experience, so I didn't feel I was sitting someone else's lap.  With this experience, I will be glad to go back."
1805,2,"I've been here a couple times... very dive-y.  There is a very specific crowd of regulars here that know everybody. \n\nThe girls are ok. (sorry ladies)  There is a wide variety of types of ladies there... tall, skinny, wider, dark, light, almost naked, almost fully clothed... \n\nWe walked in once at about 1am... only an hour left before they closed.  They wanted to charge us the full cover. Eff that!!  So our buddy showed up who's a regular and we got in for free. haha  Good to be with the \""in\"" crowd here."
31400,2,"There really should be a two and a half star rating.  I mean, come on, the territory between \""Meh, I've had better\"" and \""A-OK\"" is pretty vast.\n\nIn any case, we popped in for Happy Hour to check it out.  First of all, a gorgeous space.  Really.  This is exactly what a modern restaurant should look like.\n\nIt was also disconcertingly empty. The staff was friendly, attentive and gracious as I have found them to be in every Fox restaurant I've been in.  Good job on the training there, Sam. Say what you will about the food but it's truly a pleasure to get attitude-free service in a town where that isn't necessarily the norm.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about the Happy Hour menu are the extremely low prices.  I mean, come on, two bucks per item?  Cool!  Bring one of everything.\n\nClassic slider - excellent, lovely homemade biscuit for the bread\nShort Rib slider - even better\nChopped salad - uhmmm, just ok.  Nice fat chunks of avocado\nSmoked Salmon on Toast - very nice\nFrench Fries - perfect, crispy and dark\n\nEverything was good but these are canap\u00e9 sized portions, so even after five items, we were still hungry.\n\nThe drinks part of the Happy Hour was a bit light however.  The house wines didn't look too impressive so we ordered cocktails, listed at $5.  We had two lovely, over-sized martinis and were charged $8.  Odd.  When I asked about this I was told that the martinis were more because they had more alcohol.  Okie dokie.  Then put that on the menu.  \n\nI much prefer the Happy Hour at Montana Avenue with the half-priced bottles of wine.\n\nOur bill was about $33 with tip.\n\nAll in all, not bad but not the best Happy Hour among Fox Restaurants and for that matter, not the best Happy Hour in Fashion Square. That honor would go to Wildfish, twice the price and worth every penny."
10207,0,These people are Scam artists. They quoted me 3 times the amount as everyone else and gave me a 4 week turn around. I took my car next store to metropolitan auto body and paint and they did it in two weeks and helped me with other damage with no extra charge.
38463,2,"The ambiance was great. The food was ok. Even though the menu seemed quite eclectic and interesting, the taste was ok."
42491,1,"Industry is right down the street from my office, so it's a frequent destination for lunches, happy hours, and the like.\n\nUnfortunately, it consistently fails to deliver in a number of ways, including:\n\n1. Service is always sloooowwww. On occasion, it's unbearably slow. My most recent lunch, it took over an hour to bring out dishes... and we almost just walked out.\n\n2. Twice now at lunch, I've ordered the chicken breast entree. BOTH times, only after waiting for everyone else's food has started coming out, they've come by to tell me that they were out of chicken breasts. Each time, I instead opted for a salad -- for which, surprisingly enough, they happened to have chicken breasts!\n\n3. They upcharge for drinks to be served neat and claim this is a standard practice.\n\nIn total, I'm thinking my coworkers and I will start heading elsewhere for lunches and happy hours in the future. This place is pretty disappointing."
48212,2,"Aside from my experience today ... the barista took some time to acknowledge me, then I think forgot about me cause my one small iced drink took fooorreverrr...THEN sent me off with the wrong drink!!! (I ordered an iced white mocha and was given something w caramel) I was extremely irritated, but at least the wrong drink still tasted ok. Not the best, but whatev I dealt w it... Anyway. .. it's usually a pretty yummy place for coffee.. but with my experience today I had to lower the rating. Hopefully it was just one bad day w that barista. We all have those days."
21776,2,"My boyfriend and I were searching for a dive near our house in Old Town for when we just aren't feeling the typical Scottsdale vibe.  I gotta tell you, I think we found it.  \n\nWe walked in around 7 on a Thursday night, just looking to have a few drinks and some time to talk.  I immediately realized this was not an Old Town bar.  I think I might have been the youngest person there and no one was pretentious at all.  They have a dart board and pool table, and seating with walled mirrors all around.  The patio was extremely well-misted, which was great since it was the day before 4th of July and everyone was pretty much sweltering.  Drinks were stiff and not too expensive and the crowd grew younger as the night went on.  I didn't meet tons of people, but the ones iI did either seemed drunk, super nice or both - not a bad combination.  \n\nI would go back again, just not every night (what do you think I am, an alcoholic?)\n\nAlso - for those of you with bladders of steel and small wallets, I saw a sign that says they do bladder buster deals on Tuesday night.  Small cover and incredibly cheap drinks until someone \""breaks the seal\"".  I would suck at this, but I'm sure many a person has taken advantage of this interesting drink special."
40806,2,"Great service, great food, priced a little high, and the coffee is horrible. They need a light breakfast blend instead of the sludge."
21910,1,"Stopped by for an early lunch today at 11:15. Nobody at the hostess station and it was several minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there. Our server didn't indicate there were any lunch specials nor ask if we had any questions. Once our order was placed the food arrived quite quickly which would have been fine had the food been prepared fresh. My wife ordered enchiladas which were barely warm in the middle so they obviously were pre-made and reheated. My machaca burro was fine. Ice tea was never refilled and, we weren't asked if we wanted dessert. I don't know if it was an off day for them but I'll probably not find out since one bad experience is all I'm willing to invest."
3666,3,"Came here after playing some disc golf...This place has the best calzones!!!  Their pizza is good also, but gotta go for the calzones!  You really get your monies worth for $8.  Their draft rootbeer is good, but you could taste a bit of a beer aftertaste.  Love the scenery with outdoor seating...looking at the fountain and green landscaping is so relaxing!"
34036,4,"I would give this place 6 stars out of 5 if I could!\n\nOk guys and gals, this place makes the best boba drinks in town.  It makes my Vegas trip all well worth it as long as I get to visit this place.  \n\nI ordered the COCONUT LYCHE drink and that is the best drink in town.  Order it, drink it, and thank me later.  This place use real fruits in their drinks.  It is the only place I know of that does that.  Other boba places uses powder and liquid sugar syrup.  Price for a drink is about $4 for a large.  I wished they have extra large cups, but buying 2 is probably better.\n\nThis place also sells beef jerky and other dried fruits.  If you are into that kind of stuff, its an added bonus.\n\nGo to this place when you are in Vegas to cool yourself down from the hot dessert weather.  Highly recommended!"
35289,1,"Most of the food they serve is out of the frozen isle of a grocery store. The fried mac and cheese balls are just fried cheese balls, theres not really any mac and cheese. The burgers are all from frozeb patties and they are ugly and taste burned and kinda cold. They grilled cheese bites are just buttered bread with a slice of cheese."
15590,3,"I give this place a 4 because while they have a great (and tasty) selection of soups, sandwiches and wraps, they miss the mark on  the smoothies.  They put orange juice in almost everyone, so while I expect a raspberry flavored \""Raspberry Rage\"" it usually takes like orange juice.  I have tried about 5-6 different flavors and most of them just taste like orange juice or whatever juice they use as their base.  I still get them, but Im always dissappointed.  \n\nBtw, IMO, the best smoothie is the Blue at Franktuary"
27023,2,"Bar Alba is undoubtedly one of the most attractive looking bars in the Grassmarket. Its sleek, striking aesthetic is a step away from the traditional, broody look of the other boozers in this area. It steers away from the cosy tavern appeal, opting for flashy style instead.\n\nIt certainly looks gorgeous and very upmarket, but I am unsure of exactly what atmosphere it exudes. We might've just been there on a quiet night but there weren't that many people in the bar which was a bit awkward. I liked the low lighting and it looked very swanky but I felt sorry for the barmaid who must've been getting really bored without people to serve!\n\nIt's pricier than some pubs in Edinburgh, but due to its location I'm hardly surprised. It's got the old town tax, but my friend who is from near Edinburgh thought it was reasonable for booze so I can't complain. They had a lot of high end whiskys, including Highland Park which I would recommend. \n\nBar Alba is nice but it didn't feel very alive despite the fact it was the middle of the Fringe. There was something quite eerie about drinking in a deserted bar, so although the staff were very polite and the bar was lush, I can't award any more stars. I'd be willing to give it a second shot since it's a nice place to drink, but preferably on a night with more of a buzz."
29380,1,"Boy, am I glad I never waited the two hour wait while at the NYC location for this glorified chocolate milkshake with tons of whipped cream and shaved chocolate served in a sundae cup.  Well the wait wasn't bad at all in the LV location so we decided to go check it out.\n\nI really do not know how this place is getting all the 5 star reviews! The decor fit with pink and white ceilings and oversized lamps somewhat like a venue where you would host a little girl's princess themed birthday party.  We shared a $14 BLT and it had too much mayo but was still BLAND BLAND BLAND. Thumbs down. The \""highlight\"" of the meal was their sweet potato fries tossed in a salt and sugar mix which was quite tasty even though it was pretty dry. \n\nExpensive and food is subpar. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to say skip it!"
2694,0,Got some new furniture and when delivered a end table was damaged.  I told them I wanted a new replacement.  Ashley's makes you go thru the repair process before they will replace the item.  I was livid as I did not want a brand new table repaired...Really Ashley's!  I will NEVER buy from them again!!!!!!
32761,1,"Cool Urban Vibe But otherwise...reallly!\nNo reservations for a party of six - Stupid policy. Overall attitude seems to be we can be rude cuz we're cool. But with vegans in our group and a previous decent experience we went anyway and told 35 to 45 min wait. Seated in about 10 mins because group left seemingly abruptly. Wait staff under trained and overwhelmed. He kept apologizing but completely forgetting the sangria order and then after reminded another 20 mins and delivered with a layer of melted cubes and beetle floating on top..really? Immediately returned with a \""No thanks not trying for another drink\"" but t still appeared on bill. Some of the food good. Tabbouleh salad was a joke. Ordered it a few months ago and it was good. This time just lettuce and chopped parsley. When we pointed out lack of bulgar wheat insulted with Oh just look there it is ....really... NONE. So manager brought a pile of chopped parsley. A see another diner recently had same complaint. Obviously new recipe being used where bulgar wheat must be the invisible variety. Really wanted to like this place. Loved the variety of clientele and urban vibe but food and service....Really NO."
9710,3,Nice hotel not too many smokers and there's a big restaurant as soon as you walk into the doors and you can't miss it it's a very fun type of hotel but still not for kids. I stayed here for a week and a half massive rooms the largest I've ever seen in my life besides Crowne Plaza in St Louis Missouri at Clayton
44987,3,"Being a northerner, I've never heard of which wich, but now that I have, I sure wish we had some in Chicago! The sandwiches & ingredients always look and taste super fresh, which I love. We've tried this place a few times & I haven't gotten a bad sandwich yet! I'm particularly fond of the club though."
32289,0,"I have never bothered to write a review on ANY restaurant until now but feel compelled to do so after horrible customer service experienced on Sunday, May 4th, by the cashier named Tricia.  There was no one ahead nor behind my party of 6 12-year old girls but we were met with rolling eyes, deep sighs at some of the girls' indecision to order in 5 secs, etc.  Absolutely ludicrous.  If you don't want to be in the customer service business Tricia, then find something else to do."
13370,2,"Fine place to go if you want a casual dinner but don't expect much more.  Well priced, many options, everything good but nothing amazing.  Loud atmosphere, service fine. If you're looking for a more celebrity chef type restaurant you can easily find better options."
37989,2,"Went to see Kaskade, Summer Lovin tour on a Saturday night. Club was way to packed, must have over sold it. If you left the main room, you'd have to wait in line to get back in. Club as far as decor and furniture was outstanding. The security staff is one of the reasons I gave a low star rating and a reason that I probably won't go back. Security was very pushy and mouthy. Customer service is #1, especially when your prices are so high, you expect good service with a good attitude. The bartenders were awesome, and also the bathroom attendants . Prices so you know are $10 for an aluminum bottle or can of beer, $8 for a 20oz bottle of water, and $12 for a well mixed drink."
22574,0,"Honestly, it's a really nice place with nice decor.  I guess that's why people think that the food is good.  Actually, the food I was not impressed at all.  The rolls, the appetizers.  But hey, again, nice restaurant."
31122,0,"This location has had no hot tea other than \""passion fruit\"" for the past two weeks. They claim they are switching to a different brand, but every other location I visit has what I want. This is just the one closest to my house.  This seems to be poorly managed."
4986,3,Amazing warm banana nut bread and delicious potatoes! The omelettes are huge...consider sharing. Coffee is not the best but everything else makes up for it. Friendly service and cozy place....the restaurant is inside a shopping center not to be confused by the sign.
19129,4,"Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!"
29913,0,"No...no....no!!!\n\nThe atmosphere is a very forced slightly more upmarket Spannish in a bottle you see in la Tasca and the food is much the same equation.\n\nLooking at the service they are actually very good, prompt and non-intrusive they did a fine job all evening.\n\nThe food for me though was a real let down, I tried the following:\n\nClassic Calamari: now I am a man that loves his squid but as soon as I saw the very pale looking batter you could see it was soggy and I was unhappy, the squid itsself was cooked fine but clearly their oil temperatures are too low creating the soggy mess I had on my plater. Judgement: 1 star\n\nChorizo & Black Pudding: cheap chorizo maketh the good meal not. An almost illumonous colour this stuff had no real defined flavours and was very chewy - the black pudding was of a decent quality but was over cooked and suffered from the over powering chorizo infused tomoato sauce. Judgement 1 star.\n\nPaela Valenciana: 1 prawn - overcooked, 3 pieces of chiecken - overcooked, 2 pieces of pork - overcooked. Now the flavours of this were good but as they clearly microwave the portions for serving the meat goes as tough as old boots. Judgement 1 star.\n\nChicken gougons with honey and mustard: nice bit pieces of chicken ina   light crispy batter was very nice. Def the high point of the evening. Judgement: 4 stars.\n\n\nScallops with crispy serrono : lovely crispy serrono - but with scallops do them fresh or not at all. These were frozen efforts that had been undercooked to make then seem soft. Horrid!! Judgement 1 star!!\n\nThe other saving grace of the evening was the drinks, 1 pitcher of sangria helped to wash my mouth out and the braqndy coffee was as good as ive had.\n\nAll in all not a good experience, I have heard this is a poor recreation of their Glasgow restaurant. My tip to them would be either improve or LEAVE!!!\n\nJd = not happy man!"
1318,0,"Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"

Crispy Basket of Hazelnut, White Chocolate, Espresso Gelato, Orange Flavored Cotton Candy\nDouble Espresso and Ice\n\nVisited just weeks ago for brunch as a guest of the Four Seasons there was little doubt that a return to Veranda was in order, and when the recently renovated restaurant decided to open its doors at 50% off to any diner making a December reservation on Black Friday the deal proved too hard to resist - the discount proving most fortuitous in the setting of a restaurant that has the gall to charge $14 for two tiny eggplant rolls and $12 for double espresso of less-than-ideal Lavazza served alongside, not over, ice as if defying one to make a mess in trying to do it themself.\n\nAcknowledging the fact that the first experience at Veranda was coordinated by PR with superlative service from start to finish, suffice it to say that a second meal booked under the name of two friends offered less impressive timing and having ordered substantially with requests for items to be sent out in a rather specific manner the start of the meal was almost inexplicably rushed - the delicious and soft focaccia hitting the table before menus were even opened and both fourteen dollar meatballs and the aforementioned eggplant arriving before a few small bites of brilliantly balanced salad were fully consumed.\n\nTreated next to a pizza that featured a surprisingly buttery crust with little char and rather flavorless tomatoes that thankfully received an upgrade from thickly applied Mozzarella and light accents of basil it would not be long before an onslaught of primi arrived and with the four-top table as well as meager sharing plates obviously overburdened despite our server personally suggesting he would \""space out the pastas\"" two of the dishes were immediately sent back to the kitchen - Chef Minichiello obviously taking the gesture seriously by not only coming out to personally apologize, but also individually plating each subsequent course in tasting-menu fashion.\n\nSpeaking specifically to the quality of the noodles, aside from the signature \""jar\"" with pasta that logically becomes a bit soft due to the cooking technique, it can only be said that most of Minichiello's housemade creations are served with textbook consistency and with the two meaty courses more 'up front' with the flavors of slow-cooked proteins allowed to shine the flavors of the Pasta Cotta Nel Vaso and Tagliolini were far more restrained, the first melding shellfish and herbs with light cream while the later was an aromatic masterpiece, the saffron and sea beans each offering their unmistakable flavors in balance to sweet, snappy prawns.\n\nPairing a half-chicken cooked Cacciatora-style, with far better results than that at Giada according to my two friends, to two sides that were simple yet impeccably prepared to maximize the flavor of every ingredient it was at this point that each in our party noted that we were becoming quite full and yet with a half-off dessert menu featuring no less than seven items I'd have liked to try it was with some restraint that only three were ordered - the doughnuts a but underwhelming when compared to the buttery seasonal Crostada, but neither even in the same ballpark as the 'signature' in terms of taste or presentation, the cotton-candy topped pedestal featuring soft lady fingers and mascarpone soaked in Amaretto with boozy blueberries and three balls of ice cream making for one heck of a 'sundae.'\n\nTipping on the pre-discount total to the tune of just over $200 for the table it must be said that considering the cost of the meal Veranda presented one of the best dining values on the Strip in this particular circumstance, but taking into account the service gaffs and truly laughable coffee upcharge the question becomes whether yet another visit could be justified at double the price - something I cannot say I'm certain about at this point."
28148,1,"Some really great produce prices, which are what pulled us in.  We got a newspaper flyer from them last week and decided to check it out, based on that.  Still, I kept thinking, isn't this the place [friends of ours] went to and said wasn't that great??\n\nThe produce is priced well but it seems like everything else is on the high side.  Bulk food section was small-ish, I though.  I meant to bring a pen and paper to write down prices of items I usually buy, to compare RBN, WF, TJ's, and EEFCO - but forgot.  But long grain brown rice was $1.99 here, which is same as EEFCO.  I think walnuts are more at RBN, though.  Basically - don't believe the low price claims!\n\nI think we may go back for produce and that may be it.  Free parking is nice, though - they cover 2 hours, which would give you a little time to wander, too.  Parking is covered which is oh so nice.\n\nOne negative for families is no changing table in the bathrooms.   I had to change a diaper  on the floor of the bathroom on my husband's coat.  Yeah, the floor was pretty clean, but still.  Ugh.  Not a good thing for families!\n\nupdate - they did eventually add a changing table, but I guess their low priced produce and high priced everything else model didn't make many people happy.  Defunct!"
26090,4,"I've been to this place several times over the past month now and as far as Sushi experience i'm very happy. Let me first point out that I love the reverse happy hour that they do between 8pm-10pm. Prices on meals are incredibly cheap. My wife and I usually end up getting out the door with a few plates and drinks for 25 bucks. The pricing I think is wonderful.\n\nThe service is also excellent. It's usually not long even with a packed restaurant to get your food. Service seems to be very attentive my drink gets near 1/4 and the server is around to check if I want a refill and need anything. They take plates as you finish them and im not left piling them up at the side of the table hoping someone will pick them up like at other restaurants.\n\nOverall i've been happy with just about every dish from this place. I don't claim to be a Sushi expert, but no dish thus far has been distasteful or of poor quality. I really like the crab rangoons for an appetizer, and the blue flame and golden Buddha are great. \n\nOverall i'm very happy with this restaurant and I enjoy my experiences here each time that I go."
26150,2,"Received an email from the owner of the restaurant,  who states they are still open and it was a competitor across the street that closed. I don't live in Montreal so I can't confirm,  but my apologies to the proprietor. I wish I had found your restaurant as I was very much in the mood for sushi that night. Perhaps some better signage might be in order?"
10606,0,"Wonder why they keep the lights low in this establishment? It's because they're serving you rotten food.\nI had THE most horrible experience at this restaurant, so bad in fact that I will never visit another Rainforest Cafe at any location again in my lifetime. \nOur party had 4 people in it and we wanted to grab something to eat before watching Love. I ordered a Portobello Mushroom Burger (only maybe 2 vegetarian options on the menu). Our server was nice but the service was extremely slow.\nFinally we got our food. My burger was lukewarm and my fries cold. It was bland, dry, distasteful,  and even the presentation was horrible. About 1/3 of the way into my burger I felt as if the taste was off. I opened the bun to find that the shredded lettuce they put on my burger was wilted, brown, and rotting. Disgusting! I lost my appetite immediately. \nI waited and waited and waited for our server to finally come over to check on us. Upon mentioning to him that I was disappointed and dissatisfied with my order he offered to get the manager of the restaurant. I accepted. Another waiting game. Our server returned and told us that \""the manager is too busy\"" to come to our table. Mind you the restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full given that we came during the off season. At this point we wanted to just leave. I asked if I could get the price of my meal deducted from the tab and he walked off to get our bill. 5 minutes later the manager comes to our table.\nShe asked what the problem was, I told her, and  her reply was \""our lettuce isn't rotten, the cook checked it, the lettuce wilts when it comes into contact with heat\"" which is true but it does not cause the lettuce to brown. Browning means that is is old and rotting. I explained this to her and she looked dead at me and said (with a horrible snide attitude) \""You didn't realize the lettuce was rotten after already eating half of it?\"" Never in my life have I had a manager of an establishment sass me while I point out their product is below mediocre. She deducted half of the price of the burger after giving everyone at our table a horrible attitude and experience. \nNo one in my party ever wants to visit another Rainforest Cafe based on the experience the manager gave us. \nIf you want amazing food, excellent service for a decent price go to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR in Planet Hollywood. The difference, literally, is night and day."
28716,1,"What happened, Xinh Xinh?  We used to take out of town people here because we were so impressed with the place.\n\nLast time we got take-out.  Three banh mis and an order of wings.  Wings were pretty good and certainly well seasoned with fish sauce.  (If you are not used to the smell of fish sauce, this might not be too appealing.)  My wife's sister's banh mi seemed pretty good, but ours had very little meat on them.  They still had the jalapeno peppers and cilantro, but the mayonnaise seemed less, too.  I got the catfish banh mi and the fish was tiny - especially in comparison to previous trips.  \n\nWe'd noticed a decline in the quality of the bubble teas, too.  Originally they were really strong and offered flavors that Cafe Evo didn't.   But last time we got one (it was a while ago), it seemed like it was made with non-dairy creamer instead of milk.\n\nDisappointed.  Probably not going back - I guess I have an excuse to try making my own banh mi or pho instead.\n\nThe service was still good, but the food is simply not as good as it was when they opened."

10397,2,"Who needs after hours when clubs open until 6 in the morning? I am very surprised though of the party they host here. They draw a good and energetic crowd even at 4am (and you still have to wait outside for the bouncer to let you in). The party is basically in the basement of the casino which is not laid out too well but was packed of party heads nonetheless. Good atmosphere for an \""afterparty\"" but I would rather stick to the main clubs."
22945,1,Came here in July. It was hot. Not just hot but hot as hell. That was inside. On the balcony. There was a cool view of downtown Fremont. But it is even hotter. I was in there looking for air conditioning vents. The bar was OK. Nothing real special besides the view of the Fremont. I would return in a cooler month if i am downtown again. The music was good. That is another plus. More urban less top 40's.
46570,3,"Waited less than 10 minutes at 8:45 am on a Saturday for a table outside (had the dog with us). Waitlist sends you a quick text when the table is ready - and the text includes a link to the menu. Nice touch. We were quickly served - had tofu scramble, wife had breakfast burrito and soy latte. Food was great. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive. Prices were more than fair for the quality of food served. They have doggie bowls for water if you're there with Fido.\n\nWill definitely return again. Tip from the waitstaff: Arrive well before 9 am on the weekends as it tends to get extremely busy 10:15 am onwards on the weekends. Not a problem for us at all."
19002,3,"Several steps above Pei Wei - I come here for lunch frequently.  The Singapore Noodles are great, as are many of their stir frys.  Locally owned and operated!  This place has many regulars, I know of one couple that eats there every day!"
38950,1,Horrible horrible service!!!! What happened to this place?\nFood is good and fresh. I refuse to go here during normal hours but if I'm craving sushi at 2am then I'd stop by. Otherwise I will drive way across town to Yama Sushi for excellent service and food! So sad to see this place fall apart..
49730,4,"We had one of the best meals at Cleo last night.  The staff and service were excellent. The lamb chap and all the tapas dishes we tried were tasty, creative and all a little different. I highly suggest people watching in the sls lobby as it's like a red carpet for the sexy youngsters heading out for a big night.  See a much different Vegas crowd here like the palms when it opened."
9176,4,"This course has been on my radar for awhile, but just a bit out of my price range, but I decided to make this a \""tax return splurge\"" for myself, and could NOT be happier with my decision!  Every hole is different.  The staff is excellent.  The greens, while a little marked up, putted true and very fast.  And at a rate of $110 from their own website (booked a week in advance and cheaper than golfnow, btw), it's a far better value than your standard North Scottsdale courses, and equal to, or superior in quality.  A couple negatives; sand was a bit compacted and a couple tee boxes were hard to find a level spot.  Also, if the ball gets into the desert, get a new one.  \n    I will play this one more time in \""season\"", and several times this summer.  Don't miss this.  It will eventually go totally private at some point."
46610,1,"My daughter and I visited for dinner for the first time. This is more of a lunch place than dinner.   The wait staff was very helpful.  But I have to say that I was not impressed with the food and the music was way too loud for my taste.  I thought the meal was a little too pricey for what you get.  I suggest adding more spice than you think you need.  I thought I added enough.  But, my food came out bland. I am not a fan of americanized Asian food. Definitely prefer authentic."
15517,2,"what happened Krave?! I guess it's gonna be hard to relive my first Krave experience back in 2008. back then I had heard about Krave and was itchin to go and as fate had it happen, my hook up fell through at the MGM and instead of wasting my cab ride from my off strip hotel with my two girl friends we decided last minute to walk over to Krave. And if you ask my two girl friends and myself how our experience at Krave went, we'd tell it was fuckin awesome coz we're in Las Vegas Bitch! but alas fast forward to '11 and my Krave visit was okey. yes it fizzled crashed. ok ok maybe it was my mood, things last weekend fell through because of messed up circumnstances like girl friend's friend never got through with his table rez at Marquee and someone took 4 hours to get ready!! The drinks were still good (and cheap compared to Surrender), the crowd somehow wasn't that delicious, gogo's were meh hillcrest gogos are way hotter! and the music was aight but the dj kept on doing these horrible dubstep transitions that it wasn't right. ick! But I will stop come back to Krave in the future like earlier, it still holds a special place in my heart as one of the few clubs in Vegas that are still worth going to just to dance. =)"
21060,3,"Both my wife and I ordered burgers. I had the pesto burger as seen on triple d and she had the cheeseburger with saut\u00e9ed onions. I had the onion rings and she had the garlic fries. To be honest I expected more from the burger that was featured, it was ok, I was not blown away by it. However, the onion rings and fries were the bomb! My wife enjoyed her burger as well. Will return for sure."
7315,3,"During my mercado shopping day this week my husband was craving Mariscos ala Mexico and our pal Tom knew just the place. This little hole in the wall has all the right signs as you walk in the clientele is made up  of a wide slice of phoenix from  your  people on office lunch breaks , abuelas  with their famillias  and average types like myself.  We ordered seafood inspired Mexican food like shrimp enchiladas  , fish tacos (good but nothing to start a talk thread about )  and sopa de mariscos ..very tasty!   The chips were very fresh and the guacamole and salsas mucho yummo.     word of warning they put a jalepeno butter on just about every entree, for those that dont know oil  spreads the heat in peppers ..so your food is spicy!\nI will definitely be back again  to try the sopa again ."
2538,1,"Went here recently for the first time. It was okay. Unfortunately I ordered pasta. It was overcooked, and didn't even have the mushrooms and olives that I asked for. My husband got pizza, and I tried a bite. The pizza was good. We did have the garlic knots as an appetizer, and they were pretty good. Customer service was meh. The girl Aleah, who was serving us kept smiling like she was trying not to laugh. It made for a really awkward dinner. I'd come back for the pizza, but nothing else. I probably won't be back though. If I'm going out for pizza, I go to Venezia's Pizzeria. Their pizza is amazing, good prices, and their staff is really friendly."
21460,0,Complete rip off  of an appetizer $5. $5 for 2 dumplings about the size of my thumb. The regular menus price was $8 for 4 (which we were not made aware of before we ordered or we would have just gotten that). So we paid more per piece on their special happy hour menu. Happy hour wine was advertised as $4 glass was actually $5.  We won't be coming back. Feeling like you got taken is not a pleasant dining experience.
48921,0,"My friend and I came in for a late lunch around 2:30pm and we were greeted and seated quickly, since there was nobody here. I ordered the calamari and my friend ordered the iceberg salad. Our food came out surprisingly fast, not in a good way, basically as fast as a fast food restaurant would bring out your order. The iceberg salad was drowned in dressing and the lettuce was limp and lifeless. It tasted like it was premixed and was sitting in the refrigerator overnight, disgusting. The calamari was alright. The last time I came here when the place first opened it was delicious, downgraded quite a bit. Although we got seated quickly and our food came out quickly, after that the waitress barely even came to our table to check up on us. We sat here for an extra hour waiting for our check. Definitely will not be coming back, would rather check out Olive Garden."
209,0,"This is the worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh has some pretty bad Chinese places.  The Golden Palace buffet is bad, but at least edible.  I am utterly baffled at how this place stays in business."
33906,0,"As a property OWNER, my experience with Priority Property Management was not positive, the least to say.\n\n1. they misadvertised my property by linking it to an automated voice mail that described somebody else's property. When I brought this to the attention of Michelle, the owner, she advised me it was not a big deal and that prospective tenant's don't even listen to the message but just leave a voice mail expressing interest in viewing the property.\n\n2. Turn-around time to get the property rent-ready (carpet cleaning, painting, etc) was 26 days. (in my experience, it's been between 2-7 days after tenant moves out).\n\n3.it takes a while for them to return your calls/emails, in fact it is their policy to get back to you within 48-72 hours. In my experience from dealing with other PM (property management), it's usually a few hours to 24 hrs. Their standard answer was that they were \""short-staffed\"". An interesting fact though, 3 months after I left them, I emailed to get a lost invoice, and I received an automated email response stating they were short-staffed and will get back to me within 72 hours.\n\n4.they did not change the lock between tenants, which we learnt about when we were picking up the keys from them to hand it over to another PM.\n\nOverall, I am very happy I switched to another property management. No PM is perfect, but I would not recommend this PM. Do your research and do not rush. There are better property managements out there.\nGood luck!\nSarah :)"
29322,2,"I caught a glimpse of this performance on \""So You Think You Can Dance\"" so I had some idea of what I was going to see.  There was more dancing than acrobatics.  I am more a fan of the acrobatics.  There were a couple of duets and different arrangements of songs which I felt were ok.  The musicians are very talented.  I love seeing the band up front.\n\nIt was a good show that explained a lot about Elvis' life up to his time in Las Vegas.  I do not think I will be running back to see it anytime soon but I am glad I saw it.  I did not listen to much of Elvis' music while growing up, but this performance has made me realize how much I like Elvis Presley."
37196,3,"I had just about given up on teeth breaking and cavity inducing macaroons until I decided to try one of Manon's on a whim. It was a bit pricey for 50 cents or a dollar a piece the size of a quarter, but has some substance to it and is so chewy and soft compared to the sugar rocks I've eaten before in New York. \n\nI also had an apple pastry with almond/pear spread beneath on a flaky crust that was to die for. I think that was about $4.00. \n\nThe chocolate croissants are small and a bit more chewy/hard than I'd like, but still good. There are two different kinds depending on if you want more or less chocolate, and each of those are about $2.25.\n\nWhile it's not the cheapest grocery store bakery, it's also not grocery store quality. I would go there more often if I had the money and waistline room to spare for it."
42696,1,I needed a drink so I came here. Service was ok nothing great. Hell the guy was not even happy to be there. Seemed lost really. Drinks are always high priced at the airport but what can you do. food was just ok not even good. \n\nOver all food was not good and service not at all what it could be. I wont come here again.
11281,2,"Great drink prices and nice staff in the bar, but sooooo smoky that I could only stay for one drink."
25413,2,Nice place for a brunch. A bit expensive though and no pancakes!
42158,1,"Maybe it was just because it was a Wednesday night and I was tired, but I went to see Jose James with a couple friends at Le Piano Rouge.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a huge fan of jazz and didn't know who Jose James was before the night.\n\nThis was my first time here and it is a small quaint place.  I find the setup to be very interesting for live music, because half the place can't see the stage.  If you just want to go there and listen then I guess that's okay, but still.  They also charged me for three drinks when I only had two, but I didn't bring it up because I didn't have the energy, so that would really be my fault.\n\nAs for the night I went, we went to the early show, which started later than it was supposed to and cost 30 bucks at the door.  I guess I really don't like jazz, because I didn't enjoy myself listening through the hour and a half set.  There was a later show that night, but after stating you could stay they kicked everyone out who was at the early show for people from the later show.  I wasn't planning on staying anyways, but it still was weird they did that for people who enjoyed the show.\n\nI will have to try the place on a normal night to fully appreciate it I guess, but this review was based on my experience that one night."
3752,1,"Went there for a NBA Playoff Game (Suns vs. Spurs) about a year ago.  It was crowded and there were many drunk dirty boys trying to score - ewwe!  It has the potential to be a nice little-hole-in-the-wall place, but as it stands currently-not so much.  Would not recommend this place."
37639,4,"the burgers are Delicious! the salads are yummy. The staff in the front are very attractive. for the guys, sit in the front or the bar!\n\n the flavor of the food itself has always pleased my tongue. \nthe yam fries sometimes come out a bit soggy. and the price of the burgers is a bit high for what you can find elsewhere, but heck you're at the cosmopolitan casino, nothing is cheap there.\ni want to give this place a 4.5 or 4.75 stars."
22525,0,New ownership doesn't get it .
3913,4,"I've lived in Tempe for over thirteen years and have been ordering pizzas from this location since moving to Tempe from Ahwatukee. I've never had a bad pizza from the Ahwatukee location (Lived there 6 months.) nor the Tempe location. On average we order Rosati's pizza from this location at least every 3 weeks or so. We save the coupons from the boxes so we've had a lot of pizzas for half off over the 13 years of being a customer of the Tempe location. Our favorite pizza has been the Gonzo (Pepperoni, spinach, green olives.), we are currently ordering double pepperoni, double spinach, onions and black olives. Same quality for over 13 years. And no I have not received any compensation for this review - just wanted to submit an honest review."
23389,3,"Food is excellent!  Go here for the food and not the location.  I am not a fan of the small quarters or the regular crowd here.  I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here.\nI would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction."
35790,2,"So, the good:  Plaintain and black bean mash, lump crab nachos, skinny margarita, chipolte ribs\n\nThe bad:  Service is hit or miss, enchiladas are meh, greens are very plain.\n\nNote: The grilled corn used to be fabulous when served on the cob.  Too many people complete complained about it being messy so they now strip it from the cob.  It has lost something.  Let's worry less about being \""clean\"" and more about good food!"
39643,3,"We went to the Las Vegas Grille for the first time and were very happy we went.  The owner Phil was there and he was very helpful telling us all about the different types of food at the grille and was very friendly. There were a large assortment of food to try.  We started with a very fresh salad and two types of potato salad which were good.  The ribs we had were superb, they had a great taste, moist and meaty and fell off the bone.  They were not fatty like you get at most places.  The chicken was juicy.  We had chicken and turkey sausages that were good.  I always check the bathrooms and this one was nice and clean.  That says a lot about the place and how the owners take care of it.  We were very happy and will come again."
35588,3,"I must admit...the pies in here are amazing. It's not often you'll  hear me saying I love pies (haha) but they are amazing here.\n\nIt doesn't look like much to a passer-by, but keep an eye out for this charming little bakery!\n\nThe prices are reasonable for the quality you get, so it's definitely worth a look!"
3087,3,"Been here a couple times for the XDC event and I've only ever really seen one track. BUT!!! When I do go, next to the track is a huge lake where people drive their different water vehicles and can do jumps I think if they want to go water skiing. I do get burnt when it's hot but when track doesn't get you burnt?"
43944,1,"Why didn't I check here first before buying the Groupon?  The wait is over 2 months and the only available time is 11 AM, which just doesn't fit into my work schedule.  I'll re-post a review if I can ever get my Groupon redeemed"
48648,2,The burgers are perfectly season that you don't need the condiments. Which is very rare to find. They just need to work on service.

21512,1,"It took us 3 tries to eat at the Brink. The first was a Sunday and it was so empty that we figured, \""Do we gamble on an empty restaurant during peak brunch hours??\"" We decided not to and went somewhere else. The second time there was a Rape Crisis function happening. We came in on the tail end of it so we weren't greeted by any Brink employees to say, \""Hey, this is about to end. We'll get you set right up.\"" So we just went somewhere else. The third time was a Wednesday night. There were maybe 7 patrons in the place and a band setting up. We don't like to eat when we don't know what the music is going to be but it looked like it was going to take them awhile to set up and we didn't want to leave AGAIN so we sat at the bar for dinner. There was a small selection of decent draft beer. I had a Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA...always a good beer. My dinner partner had a peach cosmo. Tasty in that \""Schnappsy\"" sort of way...nothing fresh about it. \n\nWe ordered the fondue because it was the only non-traditional bar food item on the menu. The flavor was right, good consistency but the selection of items to dip was not much to look at: broccoli, carrots (packaged mini-carrots), toasted bread and celery...yes, celery. We also ordered personal pizzas. I had the BBQ chicken and added Jalapeno...who doesn't. She had a Greek Pizza. Both were pretty good but again this place isn't trying to be real fancy. \n\nSo, make sure you check their calendar before you go...there seems to be a lot of functions at this place...and you might want to know what kind of music is going to be played before you show up. The blues rock band struck up just as we were finishing and they were playing to a table of what we could only assume were older friends and family. Someone's grandma was definitely getting her groove on. \n\nThe food will fill you up the way Wisconsinites expect to be filled...amply and without frill. No cheese curds on the menu...somehow."
5650,3,"The rooms are clean & the air conditioning works great! Prices are pretty good & the more you play there, the better deals you can get. I've had good & bad experiences with the counter people @ check-in & out.\n\nThere are multiple pools - all with different temperatures & a bar located by the pools. \n\nThe location is awesome. I love gambling @ MGM, but don't want to pay the prices to stay there. It's about a $10 ride to the airport.\n\nThe casino atmosphere is fuuuun. The music is great, the Craps table gets busy as soon as it opens. The roulette tables light up, which is definitely entertaining. (Play 29!) Poker area isn't the largest - usually only one table open so there are definitely better places to play that :) \n\nTwo bars - one in the front and one halfway through the casino floor.\n\nThe actual Hooters restaurant has GREAT food. Their wings are simply amazing. You can order all drumsticks if you want for like 10 cents each. The wait can be a little long, but the service is typically decent.\n\nThe Mad Onion restaurant inside is open 24 hours & they have some great deals, but the service is shotty & the wait can be FOREVER. They say they make the same wings as the restaurant, but they don't taste like them at all. The old restaurant used to be great, but since the name change & I'm assuming the new staff, it SUCKS.\n\nOverall: good, clean, cheap place to stay."
8583,4,"I totally understand this is a hate it or love it place. Well I love it! It's really small so no matter where you stand you have a good view. And the sound system is pretty good. Drinks are reasonably priced, and made really strong which is nice. Get some pre-show pizza it's really yummy for 3 bucks a slice!"
653,3,"On a business trip, my colleagues and I stopped at Dean & Deluca twice: the first time for lunch, the second time for wine happy hour.\n\nI had never been to a D&D, and I balked at having lunch there since my impression was that it was a fancier Starbucks, i.e., I didn't want to go broke buying a coffee and a microwaved sandwich. However my coworker raved about it and swore us two ladies would love it, so we went. \n\nI absolutely LOVED it. It is a gorgeous environment, all loaded with (admittedly overpriced) specialty food items, gourmet bakery delights, candies, cheeses, a hot food bar, a luscious salad bar - and wine. LOTS of wine. If you're a oenophile (I am not; my two companions are), then you will likely be as delighted about the wine selection as they were. I had one of their weighted salads (I selected grilled chilled shrimp, goat cheese, artichokes, sundried tomatoes - a few of my favorite things!), and it came to about $11. I thought it was insanely delicious, and for those kinds of toppings not unreasonable at all (I've bought those things separately at a regular grocery for  similar salads at-home and the cost is gargantuan). I absolutely loved their salad selection.\n\nMy companions enjoyed their sandwiches immensely (and cracked open a bottle of vino as well to enjoy). My wretched diet prevented me from sinking into one of those lovely single-serve desserts on display - but damn I was tempted.\n\nWe returned the next day for wine happy hour with the rest of the office. The wine room was packed and weren't able to accommodate our party of seven. However, a super-nice young waiter (I want to say his name was Ahmad - he had a faux hawk and lovely manners) was more than solicitous, helping us pull together several tables and chairs, and timely popping around to serve us impeccably. (My knowledge of wine and how it should be served is nonexistent, so I can't wax eloquence about it. However, I was at a table of PASSIONATE wine lovers and they raved about the two reds ordered and didn't make a peep about service so I'm guessing it had to have been very good). \n\nI'm not a wine drinker myself, so I sipped on a yummy diet cream soda (never seen the brand in a Kroger or Target myself - even the diet soda seemed exotic and fancy), and nibbled with restrained gluttony on the delicious cheese plates (rich, creamy, pungent, salty, fragrant cheese with names I can't pronounce). Prices were on the higher end, but the service and atmosphere were just so serenely luxurious that I can even forgive D&D for not carrying my top wine selection (a $5.99 bottle of Barefoot Moscato). \n\nOverall, I loved D&D. I heard that we used to have one in Cincinnati, and I'd be quite happy if they ever thought to return back to the Queen City. Probably better for my budget that they don't though..."

12289,2,"Small, easy to navigate, a good middle-class hotel. Stayed in the \""Playboy Tower\"" which was nice. Within walking distance to the Gold Coast and Rio, but not much else. Ended up here because of the good mid-week rates. Can't say I'm compelled to return for any reason, so will most likely stay elsewhere next time. Highlight: seeing a hooker get arrested in the lobby at 2AM."
1887,1,"I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night, but that's about it... I will not be returning to (this) Pei Wei any time soon..."
41306,3,Food was fantastic. I had the French Toast and my fiance had the grilled cheese and we both loved it.
46814,3,"Paul's Pel'meni specializes in one thing and one thing only: Pel'meni. Pel'meni is a sort of Tortellini mixed with dumplings, then covered in yellow curry, cilantro, and sour cream. At Paul's, they serve beef and potato pel'meni. I tried a half size of both flavors, and for someone with a small stomach like me, it was plenty of food for dinner (it doesn't look like it would be enough, but it's really hearty).\n\nWhile both flavors were good, I preferred the beef. It was spicy (as in with spices) and extra flavorful, compared to the potato and I think next time I'll probably get just the beef and set of a mixture of both of them.\n\nAlso, the price point was awesome. All this goodness for 4.50 for a half. I can't wait to come back after a night on state street. It will be good post night out food."
14879,1,Rude staff... Way over prized. Spent $60 on two drinks and two servings....

28210,0,"If you're going to book an appointment, do it by phone or in person. During our trip my fiance and I booked 2 massages online and got a confirmation for it. When we went to the actual spa, the receptionist could only find one appointment. We didn't have extra time in our schedule that day to book another appointment for a few hours later, and if we tried to change the current appointment they would charge us an extra 50%. While my fiance and I debated what to do (we were insisting that the other person get the massage), the receptionist apparently found this very amusing and was laughing. Extremely unprofessional. The spa was suppose to be relaxing but this was the exact opposite experience. I was too pissed off for a massage at that point and went back up to the room. Later my fiance said the massage was only average. Overall I'm very disgusted by this experience. Based on the the rave reviews, if they can fix their pathetic web-based reservation system, it might be worth a $200 massage. For the time being, find relaxation elsewhere or get your reservation in person/ over the phone."

19940,3,"I looove sammiches and Jersey Mike's does a great job of making some good ones.\n\nLocated right next to Firefly, JM serves up some great sandwiches in their own way. Jersey has either cold or hot subs, and everything is cut and sliced fresh in front you like like Port of Subs. They don't have baked subs but they do have a grill for their phillys.\n\nI came in and ordered the Club supreme or whatever they call it... The sandwich was great, they sliced a ton of meat on to it, the toppings were perfect and the bacon was suuuuper crispy. On top of that, the service was great! People who work here were real nice. The friends I came with had a the Chicken Parm hot sandwich, though it sounded good, it came out to a hot mess literally.\n\nThey def get points for offering a UNLV discount, but beware showing up at lunch time! They can get packed."
48777,2,"This place will do well because it's trendy and modern inside. A cool ambiance..the food is just ok. The hash browns had way too much salt in them. The mushroom, spinach scramble was dry and bland.. Huevos Rancheros were just ok. But hey, it's probably a hip place to be so food is secondary I guess."
2717,2,"We bring our daughter here since she was born 5 years ago. I have to honestly said that Dr Leavitt and Dr Guthrie are great doctors. Sometimes when she fell ill and in order to have a peace of mind,  we simply brought her in. I do not see them trying to \""sell' me medication by prescribing any kind of prescriptive drugs if is unnecessary. All they advise me is I have a choice to go and buy some medicine over the counter, or just let her rest and drink plenty of water! I am somewhat 'old fashion' and don't believe in feeding too much drugs for my kid.\n\nI have to say that the waiting time is always long even is a scheduled appointment. Waited in the front desk can be quick, but after the nurse called you in and take the kid's temperature, weight etc. there is another round of waiting, as bad as more then 40 mins. The entire visit can be simply 10mins but take 1-hour or more to see the Dr.\n\nI understand this is a busy office operating in 2 locations, and when you call the front desk to schedule any kind of appointment, whoever answer it always seems to ask you to hold....somewhat under-staff?!"
23155,0,Very disappointed. Went there on a Saturday night. They said the were down 2 chefs. It took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out. The food was hot so that's why I gave a 1 star. I'll never visit this place again. I'd rather go to YCs

38213,1,"The ambiance is very nice, it does have a good location but the food is not all that. My Salmon was on the dry side, the Arugula salad had no flavor, they just put cheese on it and the pork ribs were ok but not the greatest. It wouldnt be my first or second pick if where to eat again. Sorry guys! But the waitresses were very sweet n nice!"
19617,2,"This is small quaint place that sells pizza by the slice or the whole pie if you wish. \n\nThis is a 1000 times better than Sabarro's but nothing to write home about either.

Between the cocktails and the apps,  it was all awesome.  \n\n\nSo,  the two flat-breads and the fried mushrooms were my favorite.  Also the rum punch was my favorite drink.  The other food they had were nachos and shrimp.  \n\n\nIt is always great to see friends that I know and meet new people at events.  Thank you Lindsey and Outback for a wonderful evening out."
44629,1,"It pains me to write this review, because I went to their location on Mont-Royal right when it opened and the experience was great. This location is a different story. I went with three friends a few nights ago and sat on the terrace. Because St Catherine is closed to vehicles at this time of year down there, it was a really great experience to sit out there. The food was ok -- but the service was dreadful. We all got the table d'h\u00f4te which is $24 for salad, pizza, non-alcoholic drink, and dessert. A good deal! Long story short, the salads never came and ended up being served with the pizza (not a huge deal), then we never saw the server again. Half our table was cleared at a certain point, but about 30 minutes after that we decided just to go inside to pay. At the register, we reminded her that we had dessert with our meals and she laughed, saying she had totally forgotten. As we paid, she piped chocolate icing into to-go plastic cups and handed them to us. Strange! I actually think their pizza is pretty good -- so I recommend it -- but strongly suggest going to a different location."
6978,0,Worst flight experience ever.  Traveling with three small children and closed the door on us for our connecting flight because they had re routed us without telling us assuming we were not making our connecting flight which we ran to and arrived at in time.  Customer service may as well close up since they are just faces who can't do anything but admit we were right but they are powerless. Same with 1-800 #.  Don't waste your money flying this airline.
31765,0,All my lunch crew has said such great things about this place so I had such high hopes... I went to the counter and ordered the Lamb Souvlaki - Tender pieces lamb sirloin marinated and grilled with your choice of two sides... The sides I went with were fries and the vegetables... I mother tells me I need to eat more vegetables so I thought it was a homerun meal. I rate the experience as followed...\n\nLamb Souvlaki - F\nFrench Fries - C\nVegetables - D\n\nI have a lot of Lamb in my life and that was by far some of the toughest I have had but it did have great flavor... The broccoli was cut way to big and over cooked the only thing that save the meal was the side of the sauce I got they put on the lamb I drowned everything in it.  I will say I will not be back anytime soon.
27290,4,"I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say that The Mission is \""as good as it gets\"" like the five star rating suggests, BUT this place is pretty damn good. I've read some mixed reviews, and was hesitant about spending the money and hitting an off night, but when my wife and I ate here it was fantastic! \n\nThe entry way through the open courtyard is very inviting, the decor and lighting is classic and dark, yet hip and upbeat at the same time. The music does have a surprising range to it, but it all worked for us and it actually added another side to the dining experience that you don't usually find. It FELT like a night out at a lounge and that's what we were going for. The service was top notch: our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and the food came on time but not too fast. Gave us just enough time in between to enjoy our drinks (I recommend the Caiprihina... I had three and they are super tasty, especially in the hot weather). The manager or owner even came by at one point to ask how everything was. \n\nThe food was delicious, and just like others have said, there are so many things to choose from! We had three dishes from the tapas menu and combined they were plenty of food for us both. We had the duck empenadas, some kind of flat gorditas, and one of the pork belly selections. My favorite was the pork, and although the duck was good, the dough on the outside was a bit too thick and overwhelmed the filling a bit. The flavors were wonderful though, and we left very satisfied and not one regret about the price. Stop by for a fun night out!"

4177,0,"This is the GHETTO! Awful and lazy customer service!! I booked a reservation online and when I came in, I waited half of an hour to be greeted/helped, although there were only two people in line, on a Tuesday. Then the customer service rep told me they were out of cars, even though I had a prior reservation. She also rudely interrupted my friend (who was thankfully there for moral support). She then directed us to her manager, who also did nothing to help the situation. That girl needs to be fired. Not to mention that this branch has a dreary front office with almost no furniture and outdated 90's posters on the wall. Felt uncomfortable all around."
27590,2,"I have given this place a second-chance.\n\nI rate this restaurant 3 stars (A-OK) because of consistency of quality and consistency of delivery and appropriate price.\n\nIt isn't so bad if you do NOT have high expectations of a barbecue place. Plus, any place that lifts a finger to serve Fried Okra is A-OK in my book!\n\nFootnote: Pickles in a 5-gallon barrel, self-serve fountain drinks and barbecue sauce, and (hilariously) self-serve soft-serve ice creamsortofstuff. A-OK."
10293,2,"There is a lot of Indian Cuisine competition but this place does have great service and great comfort food at a good price. I really enjoy the neighborhood competition, Mint Indian Bistro and Origin of India more though, but there is something about this place that continues to keep itself standing, despite this. I would definitely go here if I had more friends who like Indian food or ate out as much as I used to. This place is a lot older. But I live right up the street from this place and if I got tired of frequenting Mint Indian Bistro on Flamingo, I would go here to get a change of setting. I think it is a little more authentic than the Mint, but I am not a fan of authentic, I like a little bit of flare to my food that is catered to Americans. My friend likes this place more than Mint, so maybe they have some special dishes that stand out for vegetarians...\n\nAgain, because it sits in a terrible neighborhood, the fact that it still survived the many years of recession probably says a lot about the authenticity of their dishes. I don't know a lot about their off the buffet menu entrees but I hear they are pretty good.\n\nThe decor has antique wood and has a fine dining appeal with the table cloth and nice water glass. But, this seems to be  a common theme for all of the Indian Restaurants, they are very properly set.\n\nThe Indian food buffet is a good deal, but if I had patience I would order off the menu because they will cook it to order and the food will taste fresh and more flavorful."
41945,2,"My wife & I went this buffet restaurant for lunch recently. In our opinion, we sampled many dishes, including the Mongolian Barbecue & also the sushi.  All dishes are average.  The waitress was friendly."
41902,4,"After seeing Hamid post abut someone's bad experience, Hamid are you still the owner?  I was told that you sold the shop.  Although I had good service I still was sad to hear that you left because you made my first experience there so wonderful.\n\nThey did it again........I LOVE LOVE LOVE BUSY BUGGY.  Seriously if you are having any car troubles, take it here.  Last night I received a ck chg system on my message board in the HHR.  What in the world does that mean?!?!?!  I called and he said it may be a loose wire but probably the alternator is going.  GREAT!  Plz let me make it to the shop in the morning because who wants to be stuck somewhere in 100+ degree weather...surely not me.  I was there about 7:10 (they open at 7:30) and Ezequieo (the NEW OWNER) was opening the shop.  I was willing to wait but he said no come on in.  He took it right back and sure enough, alternator.  Almost $600.00 but because I trust them from the last time they worked on my car, I didn't care.  DO IT!  I asked if anyone could take me home since it would be a few hours and of course he offered.  He was very sweet, nice conversation so I didn't feel like I was in a car with a stranger although I was lol.  Curiosity always gets the best of me so of course I called Pep Boys, $807.00 and Meinike was $625.00.  They've beat prices yet again.  A few hours later, my baby was ready.  Blasted the air, radio and drove full speed to make sure it wouldn't come back on.....of course the waiting area is clean with free refreshments.  THANK YOU AGAIN BUSY BUGGY.  You are AWESOME!!!  See you in a few weeks for my brakes!"
18328,1,"\""If it isn't you giving us your money, it's somebody else, so keep it moving...\""\n\nThat is the attitude that I picked up from the staff here at Tao Beach.  While standing right in front of the cashier waiting to pay my entrance fee she thought a text to a friend was more important than even acknowledging me or processing my credit card.  This would never have occurred next door at Wynn/Encore.  While I know and understand that the staff has to deal with out of control drunk kids they could have been a bit more professional and courteous, especially the young lady I speak of above.\n\nOnce inside the pool is tiny and the space is extremely tight and crowded.  I will say the DJ spins an incredible track and has some great mixes, but other than that if you're looking for a day party at the pool head North to Encore Beach Club and avoid this place.  Not impressed."
34308,1,"My theory that there are only 3 places (California, New York, Boston) in the Western Hemisphere to get good Chinese food is holding up.\n\nEverything was SOO salty!  The chili \""chicken\"" was delicious, but the tiny chunks of \""chicken\"" were about 80% bone.  Please rename this dish to chili chickenbone.  \n\nThe seafood soup was fairly bland but they were generous with the shrimp and fish.  It's what we needed on a freezing cold, snowy night.  I just wish they gave us some soy sauce or something to jazz it up."
36675,3,"Star Nursery is the cream of the crop when it comes to plant nurseries in Vegas.  They have everything you'd want for your home or business landscaping needs.\n\nIt usually surprises people that I'm a fan of plant nurseries.  My first real job was at a plant nursery when I was 15.  It made such an impact that I majored in landscape architecture and ran my own landscape company back home.  Walking around Star Nursery really makes me miss my old line of work!\n\nThe stock of plants and materials here is really top notch.  Everything from bedding plants to shrubs to trees is here, and all of it is well taken care of.  And all the soils, mulches, fertilizers, and pesticides you could need are here too.  And the staff is both very knowledgeable and friendly.\n\nIf you're doing any landscape work at your house, do yourself a favor and skip the sub-par Walmart and Lowes stock and come to Star!"
24619,3,"Gorgeous hotel and the room are HUGE.  We came xmas eve/xmas day on a special.  My partner got a letter with a great offer. 299.00 for 2 nights, 2 tickets to Le Reve( premium seating), and 2 buffets( breakfast or lunch).  When I booked, I asked if the special was available during xmas and was told Yes.  I was happy to see a 96.00 food credit because we were charged 50.00 for xmas eve dinner.  \n\nI don't agree with the resort fee since we didn't partake in anything else except for the internet.  I would have just rather paid the internet fee.  \n\nI had a small issue with not having our room cleaned, but everything else was good..   My partner was thrilled that her name showed up on the tv screen. We did have an issue with the a/c.  we turned it to 65, but it barely cooled the bedroom party of the suite.  We both slept nakey, because we were so hot."
20740,2,"Overall the food was pretty good but nothing spectacular. Enoteca loses a star because when I asked for no onions on my pizza, the waiter said it would be rude to even ask because Chef Marco wants them in there. I countered that I didn't care and still didn't want the onions... of course the pizza was covered in onions when it arrived 15 minutes later."
3291,3,This place is the best! The grounds are very well kept and the staff has been nothing but perfect... They even helped me find a free parking space near our room. The room is very spacious and we love having a full size fridge! The tub was large and worked great. We will definitely be back!! Great location in Scottsdale. Had to remove 1 star for the tiny TVs and Xtra slow internet although everything else is great!
18603,0,"I'm an avid shopper at Ulta. Every time I've come in here to look, etc. employees are rude and on top of me the entire time. The reason it deserves one star is because I was here before Christmas a few years ago with my mom (shopping for my daughter) and I had a police man usher me and two other women to the back of the store. They made us empty our pockets, purses, etc. and we're extremely rude to all of us. They accused us all of being in cahoots with each other and planning to shoplift... I'd never even seen the women before! I was shaken up and very upset. But still very polite to manager and said I understood she was just looking out for the store and she was unbelievably rude and brushed me aside instead apologizing greatly, as she should have. Little did she know I was probably going to spend 100$+ on Christmas gifts! Very unfortunate because two or three of the girls here are angels and amazing helpers."
5103,2,This place is located in China town in a very popular part of town. I love their milk tea boba and mango slush. The workers are kind of weird and don't really have manners. I still go here often despite the service. It's a good place to hang out.
24771,2,"This place cashes in on its location in the Ballaggio, right inside the door off the strip (I'm referring to the take out counter with the pastries and gelatos in it). Since the family and I did SO much walking while in Vegas, when we got to this location, hubby was \""starving\"" and the colorful mounds of gelato in the display case caught his eye. He purchased a big cone for himself and another for one of our kids.\n\nThe price of the gelato cones was astronomical. Granted, the scoops were really generous but still! I forget how much the 2 cones came to, but hubby and I were really taken aback and talked for a while afterwards how expensive this place was, even for Vegas standards (I think the total cost for the 2 cones was a bit over $12).\n\nAlso, my kid went to Italy last summer and her verdict of the gelato here was \""it's not legit\"". She said it was more like a good ice cream rather than gelato. Since she likes ice cream, she ate it all and loved it, but she said it wasn't a real gelato. My hubby never had real gelato so he couldn't comment on its authenticity, but he loved the cone and devoured it."
49308,0,"Wanted to like this joint...yelp reviewers were positive...but sheesh, cannot\nrecommend anything.  Service was awful & taco corn tortillas were hard &\nbrittle.  Fillings were below par too."
47323,1,The salad was fine.  The service however... the worst!  I felt like they were sooo put out that they had to make my salad!  I would have rather gone behind the counter and put it together myself.  Seriously- what's with the attitude?  They were not helpful at all in explaining any of the options and I felt had to pry answers out of them. I just wanted to pay and get out of there. What an unfriendly experience... my first and last visit- I won't be back!
38313,4,"Nice restrooms.\n\nI really should say up-front that I didn't eat anything here.  So why do they deserve 5 stars?  Because I want to give a HUGE shout out to my server (insert name here).\n\nI had just come from eating apps at another restaurant up the street and when my dining companion got her scallops, well, let's just say my tummy wasn't all that happy with it's contents.  I was probably running to the restroom every 5 minutes or so.\n\nOur server (forgive me, but I didn't catch the name during my sprints to the loo) was awesome.  She gave me several bitters and ginger in an attempt to calm my stomach and offered some other options I could pick up at the drugstore.  Unfortunately, nothing worked, but the fact that she gave a damn how I was feeling was cool in my book.  Oh, and the bitters and ginger were really tasty...too bad they didn't stay down for long.\n\nAnyway, I can comfortably say these restrooms are nicely decorated...just wish I didn't have to spend all dinner there."

39454,1,"Arrived in Vegas in the late afternoon and this was one of the few places that were actually opened on Thanksgiving. Our original idea was to go to the ramen place near this restaurant, but that place was closed for the holidays so we came here instead.\n\nI don't know if this was just an every day thing or a holiday thing, but the server gave us tea in styrofoam cups. Odd. Very odd. What restaurant actually does that? Mm..\n\nThe lady server we had gotten didn't seem friendly. If anything, she seemed annoyed when she took our order. There was 10 of us so maybe that was overwhelming, but it just looked like we were troubling her by our order or something. \n\nThe styrofoam cups should have gave me a clue. Besides their plates and bowls, everything else we had gotten was plastic. I had ordered their hoi nam chicken rice with white breast meat and oh man, it was... super dry. The sauce they gave me for it didn't even help hide the dryness of it. Ugh. I washed down the rest of the chicken while promising myself that I will never get this again. The rice it came with was good, but it didn't save the chicken. \n\nAt least the bathroom was clean. \n\n1 star for being opened on thanksgiving when everything else was closed. \n1 star for not charging for tea."

25721,1,"I've stayed at this Sheraton MANY times, as I come to Montreal often to visit family and  my family is Starwood Preferred members. I am always semi-disappointed. I've stayed in many Sheratons but I just think this one is sub-par compared to others. Sheratons are never too glam but I am talking about also in comparison to other similar grade hotels and Sheratons. It was very busy this past weekend when I stayed there with my mother. And there were a few weird & irritating experiences. One being that they put staff at the elevators and were checking keys on a Saturday night. This kind of alarmed my mother who was under the impression they did this to keep out hookers (witnessing some sort of scenario that gave her this impression). Just seemed liked a weird practice but whatever. The hotel lobby bar & general bar is really not great. First of all, Sheratons typically have their same menu at all hotels but this one did not. (This may be a Canadian vs American factor.) But regardless, the menu was not as good as the other traditional menu I've seen. What really irked me, was when I sat at the bar. Almost ordered the nachos, but the bartender was honest and said they sucked. I'm actually super glad he was honest - I prefer that (but heads up Sheraton - if they suck then why don't you change them!) We end up ordering a different appetizer. My mom was drinking wine but I decided to stick with a soda. My bartender asked if I would like \""more Coke\"" - I said yes just to sip on something while my mom finished her glass. When we got the bill I saw that he had charged us for 2 Cokes - $5 each! I was really appalled and wanted to say something but my mother wouldn't let me so here I am putting it on Yelp. I understand how hotel bars work, so it's not really the $5 coke that bothers me. It's the fact he charged me twice. I actually only had 1 sip of the refill. Restaurants will typically alert you to the fact they do not use fountain soda by bringing out the bottle so you understand. I never saw the bottle but I'm pretty confident it was from the fountain which makes this extra ridic. However, even if it was a bottle he should've showed it. And in some way they should bring this to the customer's attention. It's just good service. Or you wait for the request from the customer, how you would similarly for a bottle of wine, etc. He also told us if we wanted to order dessert and bring it up to our room, we would just have to go up and order room service. Really?"
15876,1,"After working a nine-hour shift, rushing through a quick shower, and driving for five hours to get to Vegas to meet up with my girlfriends, we stumbled into Cafe Bellagio haggard and famished.\n\nService here is awful.  Maybe it was the way we were dressed [it was 12am and we were all in a different array of pajamas], maybe it was because we all had our travel faces on, or maybe it was because they lacked decent customer service but waiting around for 30 minutes in a near-empty empty restaurant on a weekday for a glass of orange juice and a sandwich with fries is ridiculous!  At least give us some water if you can't pour me a glass of oj!  I get that the servers deals with the drunks and asshats that venture into their beloved city but we were nothing but polite.  My friends and I all work in different fields of customer service and the lack of manners and a smile is just rude.\n\nSo how was the food?  Mediocre at best.  I daresay that even Denny's or Village Inn can slap together a better sandwich and deep-fry some frozen fries.  Oh well.  We ate, we paid, and we left.  Never again, Cafe Bellagio.\n_________________________________________________\n\nSide-note:  I received a nice message from Mark H., the customer representative, offering me to give them a second-try.  I'm flattered for such a gracious offer and I admire they're business integrity on trying to bring the best service possible.  It shows great work ethics and I respect that 100% but I must decline.  Definitely noted though and very cool of them to try and kiss and make up."
44901,3,"As a foodie I was super excited to go eat at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. We were in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to spoil ourselves. \n\nI ordered the Lamb it was just AMAZING, every bit of it melted in my mouth. I also ordered a side of the mash potatoes which were also amazing. \n\nMy husband and a friend we were with did not enjoy themselves like I did though. My husband ordered the shepherds pie, it was his dream to taste Ramsey's twist on it.  Unfortunately he was extremely disappointed, his meal came out (we ordered two at our table) more like a soup. It was extremely watery at the bottom, embarrassed to complain at Gordon Ramsays restaurant my husband just stared at his food. I finically built up the courage to tell the waiter we were unhappy with his meal... It was returned and made again (which was better then the first). We also received a dessert on the house which was nice. \n\nWish I could afford to go to his restaurants all the time! =)"
44026,0,"Come to the area for business on a regular basis and find myself trying as many different restaurants as possible.  Took a group here (mid-week...not particularly busy) and was disappointed all the way around.  It's one thing if the food isn't as good as you would hope or expect but when the service is lacking for no apparent reason, it leaves a doubly bad taste in your mouth.  I'm a proponent of the \""fool me twice, shame on me\"" school but not sure about The Grind."
664,1,"My girl and I came here for their Sunday brunch to enjoy the seafood and hang out with new friends.  While the decor of the restaurant and the service was quite good, it's in the food category where this place was severely lacking.\n\nThe way they do their brunch is buffet style with an assortment of stations which are self serve and two manned stations, one for carving and another for omelets.  Pretty standard setup.  Along with the buffet they had unlimited tapas that could be ordered for the table.\n\nMeeting our friends there for a Sunday bite was nice.  The table was comfortable, the atmosphere up scale and everyone was generally pleasant.  That's the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars.\n\nThe buffet suffered from the one cardinal sin of any buffet type offering, the food was left out too long.  Congealed mac & cheese, sushi with crunchy rice and sausage that had been dried out from being exposed for so long.  On top of that, none of the shrimp had been cleaned.  Not the large cold shrimp with cocktail sauce or the small shrimp tossed into the omelets.  That's beyond gross and completely unacceptable for a seafood restaurant of that caliber.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather do the brunch at the Ballantyne Resort.  This place was not worth the money and with such a poor showing I won't even try them for dinner."
16921,2,"My husband and I selected Va Bene for our wedding reception. We were having a small wedding, 40 people, and had heard Va Bene was an excellent restaurant.\n\nThe wait staff and food was delicious. We could have not have asked for better service or food for our reception. People complemented the service and food - for that I would have given 5 stars...\n\nHowever, I took a couple of stars off due to the manager Donna and lack of communication. We originally started talking back in November over email as we live in NYC. It was easy enough to book and she provided us with a simple menu which we were pleased with. I emailed her to ask to meet with her in February as I was flying out to finalize things before the April wedding. She agreed (we did have to change the date since my flight was cancelled and rescheduled, but she agreed to meet me at the same time the following day). When I arrived Donna was not there - they had no idea that I was coming or when Donna would be in. We waited for a half an hour before Sasha helped us - I was ready to change the venue. Sasha was helpful and nice and offered a food tasting during the week. We came back for the food tasting and Donna met us - although she acted as though she couldn't be bothered with us. Michele, another manager from my understanding, took care of us.  Without Sasha or Michele I would have changed the venue. \n\nDonna was also very hard after that to get in contact with. She took up to a week to respond to us, and the only time we really got any information was when Michele took over the emailing while Donna was on vacation. Additionally, Donna forgot to inform Michele that my husband would be by the day of the wedding to drop things off - we agreed at 3:30 so the room would be ready. When he arrived nothing was set up...\n\nIn the end, the food, wait staff, Michele and Sasha were wonderful. I would eat there again, however, I would shy away from arranging another big event."

I had a problem with the quality and she reacted coldly, callously and totally uncaring. If you are to shop from Lens Crafters just make sure you are attended to by someone other than this lady.Just my personal opinion. She also quoted me outrageously high prices ( zero discount) whereas when i went on another day, i talked to two other sales ladies and they immediately offered to give me a discount. \nLens Crafters must be made aware of people like Dianne Reed who totally ruins the shopping experience of people like me."

696,0,"So, I had to play hotel switcheroo because Hyatt's rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay. I wound up here and I think I'm officially done with Choice Hotels forever. I've never had a positive experience aside from this one Econo Lodge in Walterboro, SC.\n\nThis hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants. If you want to go to a grocery store, they're all 15 minutes away. While the hotel might be convenient to some attractions, it isn't convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like McDonald's and Waffle House. Gross.\n\nThe beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square 15\"" pillows. Who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child!? It's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on. Pair the lack of comfort with the 11:00 check out and you have one unhappy guest! I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.\n\nThe hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.\n\nThe mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.\n\nNot recommended and officially denied going forward."

The rest of the menu looked promising too, with some swine-related delicacies sure to get foodies fired up. It's hard to understand why anyone would rate this only one-star - unless they have a personal vendetta. The staff was very friendly, service was quick, and my food well prepared. Good luck you guys!\n\n*UPDATE - Tried this again and it's a great place to drink too - any draft and a shot of whiskey for $3 ALL DAY EVERY DAY! They also have amazing happy hour specials and a nice bar area to hang out in.\n\nTry the pulled pork sandwich and corn bread for $7!!!"

28009,4,"I'm sure this has been already said but XS is a lot like Tryst at the Wynn but about 4 times bigger. This place is gigantic, the bartender told me it is the biggest club in Vegas too. The cover charge for guys on Saturday nights is currently $50 and $20 for girls, no discounts either, not even for locals. I guess this is what happens when you have the most happening spot in Vegas. The line for this place is legendary so I suggest getting there are 9pm when they open the doors, I know that sounds crazy but unless you enjoy waiting in a lines I would get there early or get bottle service.  FYI, if you get there after 10pm it will be the longest line you have ever waited in your whole life.\n\nBut how can I give this place 5 stars, because simply it is by far the best, most amazing club I have been too. With great music and an even better crowd! Honestly if you are in Vegas you have to go here, you will feel like you have walked into a movie. They also have this pool that you cannot go into on Friday and Saturday nights, only ankle deep is allowed. There are no signs about this though so it was funny watching random people get thrown or jump in then escorted out. Actually this whole table decided to foolishly jump into the pool, got kicked out, and my friends and I got to hijack their whole table after they got bounced... shhh don't tell anyone."
46538,0,"Pathetic food, will never go there again... My wife got a severe food poisoning having one of their famous soups..  The food tasted OK but never knew it could become this bad... I just can't imagine that there are so many good reviews, am I the only one who ordered the soup?? Dont know.. Anyway writing this review so that everyone out there can be cautious about this place and the food. \nSad that I had to write a bad review but I just hope no one gets sick from this place again..."
15640,3,"Their scones are divine and it is a nice little place with fine coffee.  I only wish they would not let dogs in.  I am allergic to them and it rather spoils my meal.  If they had a sign on the door -- no dogs, except service dogs it would be fine.  The ones brought in are not service ones.  Their scones are delicious and made daily.  Go there!"
668,2,Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed.   The food was good but not great or amazing.  Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted.  My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great.  We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items.  The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too.   Overall the service was very good but slow.  Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.
4151,0,Every time I go here there is always something wrong with my order always check your food before you leave I guarantee you will always be missing something or something ain't right.
16541,4,My first Yelp review and it had to be done. Outstanding fresh Mediterranean food that is hard to beat. Owners are friendliest in the business. Prices are certainly reasonable for the quality you get. By far the best babaghanouj I've ever had. Been going here for years. Lucky that such a great unique place is so close to me. Menu is simple and they will alter anything you want to your liking. Stop by and dine in it get it to go you won't be disappointed.
25539,4,"Had a great stay at Antoine's Garden B&B!! First, it's got a great location, one block from the central bus station, and located at the robust corner of St Denis and Ontario. With plenty of bars and restaurants to go to nearby, and with the exciting Latin Quarter just up the block, there is no shortage of places to visit within walking distance. \n\nThe B&B itself was very nice. Friendly staff 24/7. Quaint decor, especially the staircases and wall art. A rather bountiful continental breakfast with more than just the traditional toast and coffee-- a generous spread of pastries, eggs, yogurts, cheeses, ham, cereal, and on one morning, croissants!\n\nThe room was a good size, large with a comfy bed. My only complaint (and a 0.5 star reduction) was because the rooms were not well cleaned on my days there. The bed was made and the room was tidied up, but the towels were not replaced when left on the floor.  4.5 stars,"
25012,3,"The Hero Factory is 2 minutes from my office, good for my foodie obsession, bad for my waisteline.  This place has absolutely one of the biggest heros I've had.  $10 will get you a hero and a drink.  A little pricey but I can never eat the whole thing and that means lunch the next day too."
32781,3,"I didn't stay here, but was dropping off my best friend and went with her to check in.\n\nWe arrived at almost 11pm on Thursday night.  This was the week of CES and the Adult Entertainment Convention.  So when we got there, the front desk women said they had overbooked, and that she needed to speak with her manager to see what could be done.\n\nWe waited a couple of minutes, she returned and said that they went ahead and upgraded her.  Her upgraded suite was amazing.  Full kitchen, dining room, jacuzzi tub, washer/dryer, projector, and an amazing view of the strip. \n\nShe and I were both really impressed.  Had they flinched when upgrading her, or made a stink about it... this rating would be one star, but since they did the right thing... Good for them!"
42606,0,"FUGGHET ABOUT IT! I personally know one of the male cooks who works there and from what he tells me the pizzas are left out way past holding times, no one uses gloves, money is touched then the same hands touch pizza. You couldn't give that to me for free! Yuck."
3685,0,"More like stress zone. I came here for my 19th birthday with my girlfriend in October,  we got facials and a 1 hr massage. Cost well over 300 dollars. We paid by credit card and they called us 3 hours later telling us it did not go through and threatened to call the cops! They probably thought I was dipping them...I apologized and went back immediately. Turns out they charged my card 2x!! I ended up getting my extra they took from me and no apology on their side. It's a very old building And the blankets are like hospital blankets but older. I will never come back here. Honestly, go to a four seasons hotel and it actually cost less with  a steam room and a beautiful built building. I will never ever ever come back here. Horrible experience for my birthday. Plus, now that I think of it they should have given me a special cause it was my birthday the day I went. I would give it zero stars if I could."
20006,3,"Big mall, with all the good shops just like down in H-town. Hollister and abercrombie. They even have the ABC store. You can buy like chips, drinks, and shirts and hats here. The mall is nice, and the convenience  that it was within walking distance of my hotel."
22969,0,"Did not honor website prices, overcharged on a la carte lunch specials, and charged extras without warnings. And every table was available at noon. Coincidence? I think NOT!!  What happened to the restaurant that was here under the same name a year ago!?!"
37865,2,"All this hype I heard about wicked spoon. Let me tell you, does not live up to the hype.  Prime rib felt like rubber.  Crab legs were cold.  Their version of ramen tasted undercooked and had the texture of playdoe.  I honestly think their sausage and dessert was the best thing there.  Would I go back? Probably not."
27802,4,"At $10 per adult, you can't really go wrong here. We spent probably a little over 2 hrs at the museum and felt it was well worth the price of admission. I enjoy American History, and this was no exception."
41659,3,"Came here for lunch and, based on the recommendations of other reviewers, ordered the chicken salad sandwich.  It did not disappoint!  Croissant was moist and flaky, and chicken salad had a fresh, light flavor.  And I loved that the sandwich came with a a mini cupcake."
1968,4,"A great garage with a great owner.  George goes above and beyond to provide quality service, fair prices, and detailed explanations of what's wrong with your car.  A recent experience demonstrates the honesty of this shop.  I had some engine lights turn on and auto zone ran a diagnostic that suggested some larger problems but after taking the car to George I found out that it turned out to just be a dying battery.  There is no other place in town I'll take my vehicles."
12615,4,A couple of tips - the delicatessen on the Grand Canal level has a self-serve soda fountain so refills are free.\n\nSelf Park is much closer to guest room elevators than valet.  Both are free but you'll have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators when you leave your car with the valet.  With self park you are on the Grand Canal level and only pass a couple of stores before you get the guest elevators.
34999,0,"Bachi Burger has been on my list to go visit/eat in Vegas for a while now and since our family's timeshare is less than 10 mins away, we decided to stop by. We literally  just walked out of this place with my fianc\u00e9 and 2 young sons, one 8 and the other 3, and this is why....We saw how many people were waiting so we decided we'll just do takeout. It took a while for the hostess to even acknowledge us and when she did, she handed me the menu and told me we can order at the bar. Waited and waited...and waited for someone to finally greet me. Surprised how long it took given the fact there were so many waiters walking by, not even a hi/hello etc... FINALLY made eye contact with one of the three employees behind the bar BUT to only tell me that it'll be a 45 min wait for takeout the same as waiting to be seated! WTF is the point of takeout and on top of that, if that was the case someone (anyone) should've told us from the get and not have us wait around. No apology, no nothing! We ended up at McDonalds down the street and believe it or not, their customer service was 100xs better! So so so disappointed......"
17083,4,"This restaurant is about as first class as it gets.  The food and service were just spectacular and the ambiance quite romantic.  It's a very good place for a nice dinner for two with your spouse more than anything, although I saw all kinds of people there. The menu is a bit pricey and everything is a la carte, so be prepared for a big check.  I loved the whiskey menu, quite extensive."
47252,3,"Great Coney's.  Something about the hot dogs themselves they have a great \""snap\"" to them.  Had the cheese fries too, they did not dissapoint."
504,3,"I went with my wife a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived not knowing what we wanted to see.  Noticed that Bridesmaids was scheduled at 9:25 and decided to see it even though it was only 8:50.  We walked around a bit in the shopping center across the street, and came back.  The lady said the theater was ready yet so we sat and read for a bit until I noticed it was 9:25, so we went in to the theater only to discover the movie was playing!  but it quickly became apparent that it wasn't the beginning but  rather the end!\n\nTurns out that the sign was wrong outside (i double checked to see what it said) and that it was a 9:55 movie not 9:25.  Needless to say we were a bit annoyed to wait another half hour for the movie.  However, the manager came over and offered to refund our tickets, which I thought was a very nice gesture given the screw-up.   It definitely is a move that will make me come back again to this theater.\n\nVery cool vintage 50's facade, and an interesting mix of independent and main-stream cinema.  I like it.  And who cares about the seats anyway.  They might be old, but I was never uncomfortable."
20907,2,"Recently stayed here again. As I have stayed here now multiple times over the last several years and have seen the multiple name changes and face lifts of this hotel I feel obligated to update my prior review. \n\nI must still state that most of the yelp reviews here are way over rated. Look this isn't a horrible place but certainly not 5 star as multiple previous reviewers have posted (IMHO). \n\nPositive: Pools and grounds are beautiful. Yelp photos don't do it justice. Restaurant was way better on recent stay. Food was excellent. Room service was prompt. Staff is friendly. \n\nNegatives: I still contend it is pricey especially off season. Again, the Four Season's in North Scottsdale was actually cheaper but less convenient for me so I stayed at the FS. There is no comparing the two hotels (see my review of 4 Season). I don't care for newly decorated rooms. To be honest I preferred the old look. The exercise room is a joke. No locker room, sauna, or steam.  Half the rooms face a parking lot which can get noisy. Denied me a late check out after staying there 5 days. \n\nAnyhow, check it out if you must. Let me know what you think."
15075,2,"Great flavor in the Kansas City beef ribs, but unfortunately the inside was cold... Makes me wonder if they just reheat everything... Brisket was good and with the 3-4 different BBQ sauces you'll find a flavor that suits your tastes."
24871,4,"The Library is one of my go to places  the South Side.   I have a frequent visitor of the Library for several years now.  \n\nFirst off is the food.  I have NEVER been disappointed here.  My favorites are the Thai Wings and the Alice in Wonderland.   Amazing flavor that never disappoints.  The sweet potato fries are a must have as well.   There is always a great selection of beers on draft - as well as great bottles as well.\n\nThe best thing about The Library: the fact that they offer a \""late\"" happy hour from 9-11.  $3 drafts and 1/2 priced appetizers make me very happy.   Especially for the people like me who are always running a little late.  \n\nCheck out the Library - you will be hooked."
34482,2,The deuce. Pricey ass drinks as per usual.
5415,3,The food was very good and tasty. Portions were big and priced reasonably.
24164,2,"I was drove past there this weekend, and then read yesterday on azcentral.com that they have closed their doors.  I had never dined there but the building & decor looks awesome, huge outdoor patio with a glass enclosed fireplace, guess it's just another sign of the struggling economy...."
16977,2,"By the time we reached here, we have so much liquid in us.  We stopped and rejuvenated ourselves with whatever soda and water we can find while walking on the strip, well u want to make sure u are amply hydrated with that 105 degree heat.\n\nBut I still wanted to taste at least 3 float samplers, but the line was too long and unruly, ppl were darting in and out like crazy, so that was enough for me.  C'mon, kids, move along...perambulating, to the M & M World."
35256,3,"I have never been to one of these chains before.  So stopped in for lunch to pick up a salad to go.  A plethora of options for salads, which is the point of a salad buffet.  Decent price and it was super clean (always important)."
37514,4,I love this place. They are so accommodating and the food is delicious. They made a special meal for my daughter and were happy to do it. Our server was helpful and friendly.  I had the roasted beet salad and the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I can't wait to go back.
19837,1,They have gone severely down hill. Have gone here for a couple years for close by chinese. I wouldn't go back.
17452,0,"God, why did I ever go back?\n\nI had low expectations coming here again, because of what it was like the last time, but this time it was worse. We sat in these seats which reeked of BO, and had to move several times to a seat that wasn't nasally offensive. WTF."
9311,2,"Looks like McCarran has a new terminal, which is Terminal 3. I like this Terminal - wide open spaces, high ceilings, lots of natural lighting. Also, brightly light signage so it's easy to navigate. I guess I'll be flying in and out of this Terminal a lot. \n\nOne thing that I don't like is the lack of a TSA PreCheck Screening area, and airports which are not experienced with TSA PreCheck are often somewhat confused as to what to do with those who are a part of the PreCheck Program in my experience thus far."
11831,3,"The crispy rice salad with chinese sausage, mint and lime is by far the best thing I have ever tasted.  I always order 2 portions.  If you HAVE to go to Vegas, (God forbid) you should check it out."
47374,4,"Aaaaaaammaaazing! I had so much fun shopping here! The staff was super friendly and VERY helpful! There are 1000's of shoes to drool over and the price so cheap that you don't have to choose one pair or the other- just buy them both! The price on shoes is $10 and some change. The sale shoes range from $5-$8! The boxes of shoes are stacked almost to the ceiling and since I am short the sales people helped me get my size shoe which always seemed to be on the bottom of the pile! I never even had to carry around my purchases, there was always someone there to grab it for me and add it to my growing pile on the counter! I don't think me and the sales staff stopped laughing the whole time- so upbeat! I left with 7 pairs of shoes for a little over $50.00. That included some sale ones and regular priced. They also have adorable handbags! I can't wait to come back to this store!"
10445,0,"Food tasted like if it had been reheated in the microwave. The only good thing about this place were the chips and salsa. Food didn't have much taste, but did make me feel sick later in the evening (perhaps because it's not fresh). I know Mexican food isn't the easiest to digest, but my stomach should be able to handle it since I've been eating it since I was born! This is definitely a no go for me."
46148,1,"First off, this rating was an average taken from my two visits to SuWu. \n\nVisit #1:\nI'm a sucker for rustic, hipster d\u00e9cor, so when I saw those wooden paneled walls, green filled space and the pendant light bulbs dangling, I told myself I would get my lazy butt there even through the midst of midterms. \n\nI dropped by with a friend on a Saturday evening at around 6pm expecting it to be pretty packed. However, it was surprisingly pretty empty and we got a first dibs on the seats. The waiter was attentive and patient so there wasn't an issue with the service. \n\nWhat I really had a problem with was how they didn't have half the things on the menu. I remember seeing some pretty interesting dishes and getting all pumped up to try them only to find out that none of them are available. I mean, why have a menu when you don't even have half the things? And keep in mind this is pretty early on into the night so I thought it was a bit weird that they're running out of things in the kitchen already. It got to a point where we simply asked the waiter what they do have and I ended up ordering a Philly steak sandwich and some rosemary fries. \n\nI'm usually not a meat person, but I have to say that was a meat sandwich that I would definitely eat again! The meat was succulent and I don't know what kind of witchcraft was going on in that sauce but it was divine...and I have to say, that steak sandwich was the only reason why I did decide to go back.\n\nVisit #2\nThe second time here was for a date. It was a Thursday evening and this place was jam packed and loud! I lost my voice by the end of the night trying to scream across the tiny table. Probably not the best first date experiences. \n\nThis time around they changed everything on the menu! Personally, I think this time around, the menu didn't look as appetizing as the previous one. Most of the food items was fried or some sort. I ended up getting their poutine and my date got corn dogs. \n\nI thought my poutine was overpowered with the green onions. Definitely not the best I've had. Apparently the corn dogs were so dry and bland that he couldn't even finish them. For his first corn dog experience, I would say it did not end well. \n\nConclusion:\nThey make a hell of a great Philly steak sandwich that would forever have a special place in my heart until I eat a better one. I would go back to simply enjoy d\u00e9cor and romantic ambience. But food wise, due to their inconsistency, I'll probably pass."
32616,3,"This place reminds me of a smaller scale Francesca's. Everything is color coded, the prices are very reasonable and super trendy and adorable.\n\nWhy am I not a millionaire? It's stores like these that I wish my money was unlimited. A definite must if you're in the Southside."
41586,4,Love this place!! Great bagels! Great service! Turkey bacon club with swiss on a bagel is the best clubs I've ever had and I worked at a sandwich place before. I can't want to go back again and eat more yummy food.
32838,4,Me and my boyfriend came to hash house because of our restaurant.com coupon and because of all the great reviews.  \n\nWe went on a Sunday morning and it was a 45 minute wait.  They give you pagers but they don't work downstairs on the casino floor.  Our waiter was really cool and very informative about the menu.  He talked us into ordering the the chicken and waffles for me and my boyfriend had a meatloaf sandwich with fries.  Omg the portions were huge!  I tasted my bf meatloaf and it was soooo good! My waffles were really good but the chicken I think needed a little more seasoning but they did put a little bit off sauce on the plate for the chicken. But  overall the food was good. Had a great time and would go back again!
39591,4,This is some of the BEST food you will EVER taste.  The SERVICE IS EXCELLENT!!! No need to run down the list of their dishes I have had everything and its all done to PERFECTION!! From the prices to the portions this guy KNOWS how to treat a customer!
370,3,"I came here in October and ended up going on the \""Ghost Tales in the Dark\"" tour. Pretty much, you get a candlelit tour of the plantation at night. And your tour guide gives a history lesson on the house and plantation, as well as shares some ghost stories that either they/coworkers have experienced.\n\nIf you come at night, it can be a little scary getting here. Once you turn off the main street, you're driving down a dark road with nature on both sides of you. Since we were already in a spooky spirit, it kind of felt like we were in a horror movie, hehe. Once you arrive at the plantation though, you just park and walk into their little gift shop. After everyone arrives, you watch a little video about the history of the place, including paranormal history. After that, your tour starts.\n\nYou walk over to the house, and tour the house, from downstairs to upstairs. Then, you walk outside to the outdoor kitchen, and then to a workmen's shed. Then you walk past an old log cabin, and then get led back to the main gift shop. \n\nThe tour guide we had a was a very informative old lady. She told us a lot of history, and I learned new things. At one point of the tour, I did get a little lightheaded, and felt a little weird, and it was near an area where the tour guide said that she also has had weird feelings. What's even weirder is that on our back home, my dad was telling me that he got lightheaded in a certain area, and when I asked him where, it was the same place I had gotten the same feeling! It was kinda spooky finding that out, but then kind of cool.\n\nThe tour was about ~$10 and I think it was worth it. I got a little spook, and learned a good history lesson. And I visited a historic plantation.\n\nIf you're visiting the area, and are looking for something interesting and different to do, I suggest coming here. No matter what time of year. But if you happen to come during October, then you'll just get an added bonus of hearing some ghost stories along the way too."
29397,1,"Over\n\nMy lowly review is unlikely to have any effect on the patronage of this over-hyped, over-crowded and over-priced tourist trap.  \n\n$15 for a double frozen hot chocolate?  Shame on me for giving into hype.  I feel like I got slapped silly and got called Susan.  It was kind of like a chocolate shake with ice chunks.  \n\nMy buddy had the \""coward's\"" banana split.  For $14.  It looked to me like a big...banana split.  That cost $14.  Last I checked, I bananas and ice cream don't cost much.  But I suppose rent at Caesar's Palace does.\n\nWe could have gone to Max Brenner...or maybe just stayed home and saved ourselves the hour wait for a table, the 45 minutes we waited for our orders to be served and the $$ I spent.  \n\nSweet?  Yes, very.\n\nBitter?  Nah, just over it."
12786,4,"The night I went to DDS there was this awful, whining, emo Dashboard Confessional wanna-be band there.  So... since it was a warm night, we were outside most of the time waiting for our friends.  We'd go inside occasionally for shots, or some other form of liquor.  This was about 6 months before I'd meet some other Vegas residents that were about 20x cooler, and would never ditch us two girls in the middle of a town we weren't familiar with.  But that's a story for another time... DDS is dirty.  Not in a Scolari's Office kind of way, either... but really deep grit.  My assumption is that it's always so full they can never really take a sponge, broom, or mop to anything (when really what's needed is a pressure-wash head to toe.)  The walls were covered in artwork: drawings, some lovely skilled grafitti, some not so great penned on grafitti, and some just plain rude phrases.  The people were generally pretty cordial to us (I won't kid myself that it wasn't obvious we were vacationers.)  As soon as the sniffly bitchy boy bands were done, I loved it there.  What I did not love, however, was even the name Ass Juice, much less the drink itself.  It wasn't bile-inducing, seeing as I was already drunk, but it wasn't even close to \""good.\""  I don't know what's in that stuff, but you've been warned."
4788,0,"I took my family here on Valentine's Day. What a disaster! The 45-minute wait was to be expected given that it was Feb. 14, but the hour-long wait to get our food wasn't. Plus, the food was terrible. The clam chowder had some weird spice in it and was congealed. Ick! The burger had a soggy bottom bun. The lobster bisque was gross. It tasted like butter and cream with very little lobster. The only thing I liked was the wedge salad (but it's hard to mess up a chunk of lettuce sprinkled with bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes.) We were all disappointed and will never go back."
6067,1,"Friendly atmosphere and very good service. But the Reuben sandwich didn't have very much meat, a disappointment since the other ingredients were plentiful."
29509,3,"I think the other reviews are unfair.  This place does not pretend to be a high-end eatery.  The food is for college kids who working through a hangover or need to load up for an all-nighter.  That said, this place does the job.  I stopped there after a long car ride from BMI airport.  I was starving so everything tasted good (though  also had to remove a good amount of the fries to eat the sandwich like another reviewer).  It did take a really long time to get the sandwich even though the place only had 1 or 2 other customers.   I had no problem with the bathrooms but I imagine they are in worse shape on the weekends after everyone's been out to the bar.\nThey have rolls of paper towels at the tables instead of typical paper napkins.  I did have to use a lot of them after unwrapping my sandwich.\n\nBasically a 2 star type of restaurant; sandwich shop/fast food, but it does a 4 star job of it.  Good, but the food could use a little more 'engineering' to taste better vs just paying for a lot of calories."
34687,0,Gimmick - they say no enrollment fee but they want 69 admin fee.  Whatever. The other lifetime fitness is only 69 enrollment. \nBullshit
13434,4,"Having eaten so many times at Le Cirque, I would say I am a bit of an expert.  I've had everything on the menu, sometimes multiple times, and I can honestly say that they do not serve even a single bad dish.  This is one high-class restaurant that has earned their Five Diamonds.  In fact, their sister location in New York City has been the haunt of many of the cities elite.  Ever since their opening of their Las Vegas location in The Bellagio, they have been a shining star in the Las Vegas dining scene.\n\nThe fine french style cuisine is separated into two sections on the menu: Classic and Contemporary.  They have a well prepared prix fixe menu, that I would recommend for the indecisive, but I have always just chosen my own.  One thing I would leave up to the staff would be the wine pairings.  The Sommelier is very accomplished, and knows exactly how to find a perfect match between your personal tastes and the food you are eating.  For those more interested in a liquor or cocktail pairing the Bartender is as seasoned and artful as they come.  \n\nHere are my suggestions for the Appetizer and the Entree, both for the Classic and the Contemporary\n\nAppetizer, Classic:  Salade de Homard\nThis lobster and fresh greens salad is in a black truffle oil dressing, and it is their signature appetizer.  It is crisp, fresh, lightly rich, and expertly well balanced.  A perfect prelude to a fine meal.\n\nAppetizer, Contemporary:  Risotto du March\u00e9\nWhile the risotto they serve changes once each season, I have yet to have one that wasn't completely decadent.  I believe one of the best I've had was the Wild Mushroom and gruy\u00e8re.\n\nEntree, Classic:  C\u0153ur de Filet de B\u0153uf\nWhen people ask me my absolute favorite food, this is what I tell them.  A large rare to medium rare tenderloin steak, saut\u00e9ed foie gras on top, with little potato croquettes and sweet onion compote.  And of course, plenty of the reduction made from the steak.  While fine dining has a stigma of not being filling, this is one large dish that I have only managed to finish once out of the several times I've ordered it.  If you plan on it, get a salad for your entree, and maybe take desert to go.\n\nEntree, Contemporary:  Magret de Canard\nThis dish of Honey Duck Magret uses the natural richness and flavor of the duck to play with the sweet flavors of the Black Mission Fig, Apricot, Daikon Radish, and Cassis Coulis.  This is something that I would not only be surprised to see on Iron Chef America or Top Chef Masters, but even impressed.\n\nWith whatever dessert you find most fitting, they also serve a tray several small bites such as a mini-raspberry tart, dark chocolate covered almond slivers, and tiny meringues.  And finally to go, they give each party a tiny chest of drawers, with a chocolate truffle to remind you of your experience.\n\nAnd believe me, if it is your first time or your thirtieth, you will always be thinking and wishing for the next time you will go."

21753,0,"Dear Lowe's - When a customer comes in and wants to spend $5,000.00 on a floor and installation services please don't ask them \""can you come back tomorrow, my sales associate just went on his lunch.\""  Prior to this the sales associate couldn't find my file and I spent four trips back and forth to the front customer service desk.  Finally I just left because space cadet  (the manager)  was obviously not going to be able to help me and was too interested in taking a lunch.  Seriously I don't how else I could have attempted to hand them 5K, but they would have nothing of it.  \n\nObviously this Lowe's doesn't want to be bothered in doing business in the  Phoenix area.  There are better stores that run a tighter ship that I would recommend shopping at.  Sorry, I don't work around your employees schedule - I am the customer - hope you can figure that concept out.  I left your store completely fuming on a Sunday afternoon. \n\nI suggest someone read the other reviews of your store - this one is nice in comparison - something is really going wrong at this store and I hope you can figure it out.  \n\nRegards, Jack"

14263,4,"Best music during our weekend stay for a Flirty Thirty we celebrated in September. I would definitely come back. The location was a little bit smaller than I remember, but probably because I was a lot more sober. The waterfall and outdoor dancing was a nice touch. One of my top three club choices while in Vegas."
24993,4,they have everything you need at a really good price. dude has always been helpful not steering you to spend more money but getting the right stuff. that will keep me coming back.
40167,3,"I really loved how this place wasn't an insane wait and crowded like Hot & Juicy Crawfish.  Don't get me wrong, their tables and booths do fill, but their service stays great.  The staff was very friendly, and helpful.  My party of 8 ordered a lot of food and our server never forgot any of our orders.  There was so much cajun food to choose from...from Etoufee to crawfish.  I really recommend their Cravin' Cajun flavored shrimp and clams!  We also tried the lemon pepper one as well, but liked their signature seasoning better.  Their sweet potato tots were yummy and their fried catfish was delicious and fresh.  Their fried oysters were crispy and plump.  We tried their chicken wings (which were a good full size) and it came with a lemon pepper sauce on the side.  Their dessert was a little overpriced for the size it came in.  We ordered a keylime pie for $3-$4  and it was  this dinky cupcake-looking tart.  I don't recommend dessert, but the seafood was bomb."
49227,1,Drive through is soooo slow.  Had to repeat order 3 times and been in line for nearly 10 minutes now.  Just brutal!
29712,2,"Found this place for lunch through Yelp -- Thanks, Yelp!    I was a little nervous of what the restaurant was like by the loud almost club-like music being pumped into the parking lot, and it was a little loud in the restaurant itself, but I was happy when my chicken asada came on a heaping pile of very fresh local veggies, that were cooked nicely (still a bit crisp, not squishy and over done).  The chicken itself was still moist and sauce that came with the chicken was really yummy too.   \n\nI'd go back if I'm in the area again and looking for more upscale/healthy Mexican.  One of my gripes with Mexican food is that it generally isn't laden with vegetables, so I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity of the veggies that came with my dish. (baby carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, onions, and fresh sweet corn that I could tell was cut off of the cob - yay, that makes me happy!).  The salads that other diners were eating looked delish too, so if you like to eat fresh veggies, give this place a try."
9693,1,"They have monthly free poolside concerts, yay. They have no consideration for the disabled, boo. The problem with these shows is that every show has different rules and the Rio nor the radio station promoting them let anyone know the changes until you get there.  The best example is my girlfriend is disabled and cannot sit on the hard ground.  The first 2 shows we went to there was lounge chair seating, the next show we were told we couldn't sit in the loungers, the next show after that we could, then couldn't.  Last month we tried to go and was told no seating but we could bring our own chair to use.  I asked security \""Any chair?\"" and was told \""Yes\"" but I know for a fact if we came back with just any chair they would not allow us to bring it in so we had to leave.  The other things they change is one show you can swim, the next you can't swim but you can use the jacuzzi, the next show both are off limits, the next show the pool is open again, what the heck?  And the last reason not to go is the alcohol, they offer an \""open bar\"" which consists of 1 free drink of whatever they decide that night whether it be flat, warm, foamy beer or watered down who knows what.  The Fosters big can is the best deal but one show it is x ounces for x dollars, the next show the same can goes up 2 dollars, the next show the price goes back down but the can is smaller, the next show the price is higher for the smaller can.  Its been 3 years that I have been trying to attend these shows and nothing has changed in that time, still inconsistent and just plain wrong.  If you want a good pool party/free concert with open bar go to Hard Rock on Fridays in the summer, its always righteous and a good time without all the frustrations of the lame a$$ed Rio."
1254,0,"I have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work, and I must say that the first time I was there, the service was slow and the food mediocre.  The last two times I went there, it was not by my choice but by group consensus.  The food is also mediocre at best, having a friend whose mother is from El Salvador, this food was terrible, absolutely terrible in comparison.  The beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water, and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water, 1 part hot sauce.  Each time I went there I called ahead and placed my order, and I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min. to wait for my food (after ordering ahead!!).  I brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant, and they told me, in their exact words, it's not their problem, and if I had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer, they have many more waiting.  I don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly.  I have been overcharged and never received items that I have ordered that were still on my check and I had to argue with the owner.  It is by far the worst service I have ever received in this city.  About 5 people I work with have all sworn to never return to this store."
17501,1,Old Town Scottsdale - ten hundred tchotchke shops in a contrived wild west setting - all selling the same stuff.  Nothing unique or original.

39392,3,"After reading the reviews here, and watching this place featured on a television show, I've been itching to try this place out.  I finally went here for lunch and wasn't disappointed.  I shared 3 arepas with a friend- carne asada, chicken asada, and the cold chicken salad.  There are menus in English and Spanish, and in English the asadas are called wood fire.  I ordered these three because they were identified on the menu with a small icon, which meant they were chef recommended.\n\nThere was a short wait because this is not fast food where meals are prepared ahead of time and placed under a heat lamp.  They appear to be made to order and you can taste the difference.  The cost of the arepas were $5.00 to $5.50 and cheese ($.50) and avocado ($.99) are extra.  I liked the beef the best. \n\nWhat struck me was the size of the arepas.  They were larger than I thought and one was enough to satisfy me for lunch.  I had 1.5 arepas and was stuffed.  The breading used is gluten free and is not chewy.  I would describe it more similar to the crunchy outside of a buttermilk biscuit.  \n\nThe cons were a very small parking lot and it isn't in a very safe area (right across from the Olympic Garden).  But overall I recommend this place and I'll be back to try the empenadas, which I was told were home made."
23695,0,"Carne asada meat was dog food quality--simultaneously fatty and tough.  The woman who took my order had trouble communicating in English.  And they have a no substitutions policy, so you're stuck paying $2 more for an equivalent burrito or eating their nasty pico de gallo."

12272,3,"We always stay here when we go, about once a year.  It is super cheap (like $30-60 a night), it has a bowling alley, and the place is huge.  There's also a movie theater if you get sick of the Vegas scene.  It is off the strip, but there is a shuttle that takes you to the middle of the strip, so it's pretty convenient.  The food isn't that great at the main restaurants, but there are new places like TGIFriday's and Fudruckers, so things are on the up-and-up in that department.  There are tons of slots since the place is enormous and lots of cheaper slots and tables.  I'm already looking forward to next year!"
45188,4,"Nice modern hotel.  The rooms are affordable, and trendy.  Just beware it is no where near the strip.  I have stayed here several times and have always been more than happy with my stay. The rooms are clean and the bed and linens are nice and comfortable.  It's a great place to stay for a \""stay cation\"" or if you want to stay somewhere quieter than the strip.  It's convenient to Nellis Air Force base so if you are TDY I suggest staying here.  The rooms are 150 times better than on base plus there's excellent food choices just steps away in the casino. It's also convenient to the 215 so it's easy to get around the city.  It has a great pool, free wi-fi and free valet parking.  Great prices and great rooms! I highly recommend it!"

1287,0,"I am surprised to see other reviewers rate it anymore than an one. I would have given it a zero if it was an option.  We went to the zoo with my family, as we are visiting the Scottsdale area, plopping a hefty $45, expecting to be blown away. I am not well versed in zoo's other than as a mom of two young kids only to find an endless walk to see no animals. This zoo/park reminded me of a deserted zoo- could it be the time of year (Dec)- I don't think so.  Yelpers!! Take your money elsewhere. Did I happen to tell you that I asked for a refund and got a flat out NO REFUNDS. They offered tickets for another day but if I did not see any animals in the park why would I travel again for the same sub par experience?? The two supervisors listened with their Starbucks in hand and had a lot of reasons why our experience was terrible. Not exactly what I expect from a business."
9471,1,"One of the girls that I went with got us hooked up at this hotel for a 4th of July weekend / friend's birthday. It's clean and the rooms are of a decent size. If you want to party downtown and have the Fremont Street Experience - old school Vegas style - this is not a bad place to be centralized. There are still way more hot females at the hotels & casinos on the strip though since it seems to be more family vacation oriented here. Slipping down the water slide through the shark tank is not as cool as it sounds, but it's fun and faster than it seems. A bit too fast to get a good look at the fishies while going through the tube, but you can swim next to them in the pool (with a glass separator of course). There's a couple of reservation only pools on the upper levels of the swimming area, but they are small and dinky. Gambling doesn't seem too exciting from the crowd and most of the table game workers seem down; we were probably the noisiest ones, but hey, at long as it's fun :p. It sucks that there were no fridge in the bedrooms, so we had to ask for pales of ice. They do leave out a bottle of Fiji water and a box of instant coffee which if you open will cost $7 for the H2O and $10 for the cafe. First thing I did when I came into the room was drank that water because I thought that the hotel was being nice, until my friend told me that we were going to be way overcharged for it. I was also planning to make some coffee afterwards, until the price tag was pointed out - Starbucks down stairs is even cheaper. At least the parking was free for hotel guests."
28684,3,"Regretfully, I haven't eaten in here yet, but due to the proximity of this fab little sushi spot to my office, I often get take-out for latenight work sessions.\n\nFirst off, the presentation.  I know it's supposed to be function over form, but the extra care the itamae put into the preparation truly shows.    \n\nSecondly, and more importantly, the fish is fresh, no one ingredient overpowers the other, and it all comes together well.  \n\nI look forward to dinner pickup at least one night of each trip to Montreal."
31865,4,"I am officially in a deep passionate food embrace with Il Vinaio and I don't see this liplock breaking off anytime soon. \n\nThe espousa and I went for a 6 course wine pairing on a Thursday night.  The dinner was six courses of seafood. We started with an amazing scallop dish, a tuna tartar, seared shrimp, halibut and steak and ended with a grilled pineapple and shortcake. With each course a glass of wine from prosecco to a syrah to a white port. Absolutely mouth watering fabulous, stellar, delicious, i could go on but you probably get the point!\n\n The wine pairings are a monthly event. I found the wines unique and not your run of the mill choices. We were seated at a long table with all the patrons who had reserved for the event. The owners of the restaurant joined in as well and the conversation was enjoyable and lively. A true diverse group who enjoyed wine. As new course arrived, there was a brief explanation of the wine served which was interesting without being too much information or taking away from the flow of the conversation. \n\nAll and all, a very enjoyable evening. Thanks Il Vinaio."
32801,0,Would not recommend this place.  The management is arrogant and the food is mediocre.  We have visited them annually for the past few years with a group of 15-20 following the Crazy Legs run in Madison.  Everyone in our group (15) agreed to look for a different venue for next years event.

So we called target and they actually weren't gonna help us with a refund because the sticker had been removed. So how is someone going to know if a gift card is gonna have any value to it without peeling the sticker out, WOW!!!! They wanted us to call apple to have it clarified, but what a hassle. Finally the manager took care of it after being on hold for so long on the phone with apple."
49655,2,"I've passed this place several times since it opened and I kept saying I wanted to come here based off the few pics the yelpers had posted, but I was disappointed that they were out of 2 of items I wanted to order. They were all out of brisket and the baker had not come in yet to make most of the pastries so it was very limited. The cashier was nice the and the cafe gave u the feeling of being in a lil cafe somewhere other than in Vegas ( which was refreshing). \n  With all that being said, my husband ordered the sirloin burger which I might add was huge and he enjoyed it! I however ordered the avocado burger which is advertised w a pretzel bun, which it wasn't. Now this might seem very minute to some, but my agreement is u can't just serve a burger on a sesame bun and not even acknowledge that u changed the bun all together.. \n   All in all my husband enjoyed his meal so it wasn't like the food was bad but they need to fix some inconsistencies."
10500,4,"The Steakhouse is by far one of the best dining experiences I have ever had hand down.  We went here on recommendation by a friend.  We were skeptical at first since it's in Circus Circus and the atmosphere there we try to avoid.  But this place is a slice of heaven!  From the moment we walked in we were greeted with an amazing aroma of food.  The meat locker in the front behind the hostess desk has a beautiful array of cuts of meat, and if you look close enough the slabs have dates on them showing how fresh they are.  We were ushered by a very nice man from NY past the grilling island were you could see them preparing your food and we were promptly seated. The atmosphere is pretty upper class with rich woods, a fireplace, darkened room and pretty quiet aside from the restraunt music and the chattering of other diners. This is definitely NOT a place for small children. Our waiter (who kind of liked like Drew Carey) was attentive but not too the point of being annoying. When I described what kind of wine I wanted he suggested one that was spot on perfect.  Our water glasses were never empty and our meals were beyond good.  I had the petite filet mignon and it was the best I have ever tasted. The cheesecake which was recommended by both the NY gentleman and our waiter was also phenomenal.  The place is a bit pricy but absolutely worth it!"
7272,0,"Shasta pols workmanship was ok however the crew told me they would be finished in one day. around 3 pm they were gone with the job 1/2 done. I wasn't informed that they were leaving for the day. they also left a mess with garbage, wires and tools laying around. on day 2 they finished the job and did very basic clean up. they clearly had no respect for my property or my stuff. I informed the office of the lack of supervision of the crew. I was informed that the Supervisor only checks the work after it is completed. I would not recommend them."

46782,4,"I have been in this restaurant for 2 times and tried their Lamb Sandwich, Baba Ganouj and Shawarma Chicken. They are all very delicious. Next time I will try Sleek which has kale inside. It looks really tasty and servings are large. Waitstaff is nice and helpful. Decor is cozy. I can't wait to go there again and try other dishes."
1281,1,I really wanted to like this place since I really dig family owned businesses I guess I will start my review by saying I ordered via phone but when I called I got an automated system that was horrible and didn't route you to anyone instead it said to call another number. After placing a huge order they said it would be done in 30 minutes. I went to pick up my order an hour later and it was still not ready and ended up waiting another 30 minutes when I looked around it seemed that everyone there was waiting for food and no food was being served in a timely matter. After finally getting my food I really wasn't impressed. \n\nPulled Pork-Dry\nBrisket-Dry\nSauce-Weak and needed spice\nBaked Beans-Very good especially with the sausage \nHot Links- Not bad but not spicy\nColeslaw- Very good \nCorn Bread- bland and tasted old
3103,0,"I will not recommend this vet. It is here to take your money. There are worse veterinary clinics than this one such as Arizona Veterinary Specialists. Their prices are lower. However when your vet needs emergency, one of ours did, you expect Your vet to take over when they are open. This is especially true, when the emergency vet (AVS) is charging thousands of dollars just for an IV drip and specialized (Level X) care. This care happens to be a metal fence in a backroom. \n\nThink carefully before you use them. I'd suggest using low cost vet and making sure that you keep animals healthy by regular dental cleaning and shots."
32733,3,"A year after first visiting, Cooper's has definitely gotten some upgrades! They do offer a little over 20 taps (many local ones), which is more than a lot of restaurants can offer. The beer selection is nicely cultivated as well. I had a lovely IIPA from the Great Dane. The server told me that the Great Dane (a Madison brewpub) only distributes their beer to Cooper's as well as serving it at their own establishments. Pretty cool!\n\nThey also expanded so they have another floor, which means a shorter wait time. The upstairs is beautifully renovated. Since I was attending for a graduation dinner, the owner kindly welcomed us -- a very nice gesture, and escorted us to our table himself. The menu was fairly limited (perhaps because of graduation), but everybody seemed to find something they enjoyed. I got the mussels and they were nicely prepared with lots of garlic. A few of the people I was dining with said the fish fry was excellent as well...next time.\n\nService was great once again! The servers did well serving our table of 20 plus!"

5839,0,"If you want service with a smile, don't go here. These guys all seem asleep on the job and uninterested in providing any type of customer service.\n\nI went to the shop to take a look at paper weight and asked their opinion on the best paper to use for an invitation. They handed me a book and basically walked away - so forget about consultation of anything. I emailed in my print job and they sent back a proof. When I responded with edits, I didn't hear back for a few hours, and then I got a message saying my print job was ready. After taking the time to drive around the Southside to find parking and then waiting in line to pick up my order, I was disappointed to see that they had printed off the original proof (and on some sort of giant flimsy postcard with the invitation on one side and the addresses on the other - not sure how they thought that made sense, and especially when my email clearly talked about printing envelopes, etc.). So they said they would fix it and reprint, but offered very little apology for the inconvenience. So two hours later, I finally was able to pick up the print job.\n\nI thought I would give them a second chance, mostly because a friend had reccommended them and I thought maybe the previous mishap was just a fluke. Unfortunately, the second time I tried to use them, they never responded to my email. I was near the shop and stopped in to follow up and they told me they couldn't print the project for me (addressing envelopes) because my envelopes were the wrong size. The sleepy sales clerk was answering me in as few words as possible and when I asked if there was anyone else I could go to for this job, or what my alternatives were, he just said \""I don't know.\"" While customer service is obviously not their speciality, I guess I was hoping printing was and maybe they could say, \""we have these other envelopes,\"" or \""you can use labels.\"" Instead, I cancelled my order and left.\n\nIf you want anyone to take a moment to walk through options with you, go somewhere else because these guys are strictly here to hit print."

9702,3,"We decided to stay off the strip this time around. We wanted to relax more, without all the crowds. Plus the rooms were a lot cheaper, so we put the extra money we saved on a rental car. We drove everywhere, so we didn't have to walk as much. It was pretty cool, because it didn't take us forever to get to one location to another. Especially when we went out at night, instead of getting a taxi, we hopped into our car.  \nI was very pleased with the room, it was fancy, but huge and comfortable compare to other Vegas trips I have been on. Only problem was that we booked for double beds and they were only able to give us a King bed, but there was a pull out couch. \nThe food choices was okay. We went back on the strip to eat though, but the bar at the pool was pretty cool. The pools wasn't crowded like the other casinos, plus they had a DJ playing music and the bar was open. It was a nice day at the pool.\nWhen I come back to Vegas, I'll come back to RIO and stay, if I want to rent a car."
24540,0,"I usually don't write any reviews, however Raku has really disappointed me this time. I have been the biggest promoter of Raku ever since its opening. My family usually has our family functions at the restaurant so when my friend, who has been living in Japan for many years and recently moved to UK, came to visit, I decided to take him and his friends to the most authentic Japanese restaurant in Vegas.\n\nI have never been so disappointed by the customer service by the guy manager. He never smiled, and only gave yes, or a resounding no, or only nodding for answers, even when I asked for recommendations or special menu. Working in customer service, I understand that people can have a bad day, seeing that my friend is already frowning at the service we were getting, I tried to lighten up the mood by trying to have some small talks (\""your restaurant looked so busy tonight.\"") The manager only rolled his eyes and fixed his attention back to the floor. \n\nHaving lived in Japan and been a loyal customer to Raku for the past so many years, I admit that I have higher expectations of Raku than any regular restaurants. However, this time, Raku really had let me down. Even my friend, who was first time to the restaurant, was commenting that the customer service is not even on par with any Japanese restaurants that he would expect.\n\nAnother example, when we asked for special menu, he disappeared for a whole ten minutes, when he came back, he slammed the blackboard on the table and very impatiently listed the items on the menu  without explaining what they were. When we asked for fork and knife, he did not even acknowledge and we had to remind him twice before he came back with them. By that time, the dish was already cold under the AC. \n\nI felt like I was such an inconvenience to the manager instead of enjoying a meal with a friend that I haven't seen for years. To make things even worse, we saw that the manager was laughing and proactively introducing the menu, the Specials, taking care of their drinks (refills) to another table of customers. I not only felt not being appreciated as a customer, but also discriminated for nothing.\n\nI don't think the Raku I dined at tonight was the same restaurant Endo San had envisioned. Both my friends and I were appalled that this gentleman was put in charge as the manager of the spot. While he was expected to teach the other servers to deliver an amazing meal to the customers, he did completely the opposite and ruined our night. I sincerely recommend him to look for a job outside of customer service and hospitality."

42104,2,"After reading so many reviews on the positive and negative about the place I just didn't know what to expect.  My opinion after chowing down there is that there's a lot to love about the place and a lot to be... What's the right word?  Annoyed at...\n\nMaybe we'll discuss the positive first, the food!  Let me first explain that I hardly EVER order chicken at a restaurant.  Usually it's never cooked right.  Sure I order wings here and there, but never as a main dish.  It's usually too dry.  I hardly even eat chicken at home, I can't cook it right either!  So going to a BBQ place while dieting creates a lot of challenges.  One is that the BBQ chicken (non-fried) was the best option.  So I was nervous, real nervous.  But let me tell you... It. Was. Awesome!  So tender and juicy and flavorful.  Best chicken I've ordered in a restaurant EVER!  I was in cluck cluck heaven!  \n\nWe went hog wild (funny, right?) and ordered every single one.  When in Rome, right?  So let's go down the list.  \n\nCornbread: Okay, but a little too grainy for my taste (and $3 for one slice!!)\nPotato Salad: Okay.  I like Potato Salad with crisp not mushy potatoes, and they were but the taste just wasn't there for me.\nMac n' cheese: Good.  It was incredibly creamy and tasty, but not the best I've ever had (Kelly's, Six Penn Kitchen, etc.).\nColeslaw: Okay. Vinegar based, which I usually dig, but again, just wasn't the best I've ever had\nBaked Beans: Delicious!  I loved the taste!  Bacon, perhaps a little sweet Maple Syrup or Cinnamon?  Whatever, it tasted awesome!\nGreens: The winner!  It was vinegar based as well and bursting with flavor.  Toss in some more bacon and bam, best of the night!\n\nThe food presentation is pretty cool too.  They just bring out everything on a big metal try and every side comes in a different looking pan it's probably cooked in.  I loved the BBQ too because again, the magic ingrediant, it had a ton of vinegar flavor!  Good thing they had extra sauce on the table because I doused my chicken in it.  \n\nThe bad.  It's WAY overpriced.  The food is simple but good.  The meats are $12-$22 for half and full racks and the sides are $1-5 on their own.  Why the high price?  Do you want to be upscale BBQ?  Does that even make sense?  Upscale I imagine has a totally different environment to go with it.  The sad thing is, it's pretty good so I bet they won't lower prices.  \n\nThe decor is minimal and simplistic.  Red gingham walls and long picnic table seating.  I wouldn't mind the picnic tables if they were a little skinnier.  It's true what everyone's saying, it's hard to hear the person across from you.  Also, if it's busy and there's a wait, people at the front are standing there with no tables to put drinks on while they wait and pretty much starring down the people sitting at the tables right in front of them.  It's just awkward and I feel like they need some high tops up front or some bench seating.    \n\nIf they lowered prices, I'd probably throw on another star and be back more often.  Because of that very reason, I probably won't visit often, even though I did enjoy it.  Time will tell...."
22206,1,"Loui Anderson was funny. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I had a coupon when I stayed at the Plaza it was for free admission to the show, which I figured there was some kind of catch. When I went to get my ticket at the concerge desk. The lady told me there was a $5 box office charge and 2 drink min and the total would be $25, I asked here how much was a reg ticket to the show and she told me $89, which was a lie. So I get my 2 drink tickets, which should be valued at $10 a piece. I go to the bar and ask for a redbull vodka and he told me you could only get well drinks, really so my free drink is not even worth the $10, what a rip off."
20336,2,"I shop here every Saturday. I can't give it 5 stars because the majority of the cashiers are terrible. Seriously I dread that last part of food shopping. Some of them are quite lazy. And most of the baggers do not know how to bag groceries. Most times I come home with something like bread smushed or broken.Also they have left items out of my bags a few times. I have many times called to complain, but apparently it falls on deaf ears. In case you ask why not use the self check out? Well to me the self check outs take jobs away from people. \nOK, so you ask why do I shop here, 3 reasons Anthony in the deli department is a pro. I never even have to tell him what I want. He remembers from my last visit. I know I am very boring, I get the same cold cuts every Saturday. That is the OCD in me. Then there is Estrella in the bakery dept. She is the sweetest person. She always greets me with a big Hello, how are you, have a nice day. And last but not least , the two gentlemen in the Pharmacy dept. I wish I knew their names. They are very kind an answer all my questions with kindness and intelligence. also the pharmacy tech is also a superstar. \n\nIn a perfect world, all the cashiers and baggers would be replaced with people who want to be there and do their job well. In this economy I would think do your job to the best of your ability. These are union jobs so they are getting a good salary and benefits. So for your loyal customers how about not being rude and smushing my bread."
23788,3,"The draft beer selection makes this place far above what the food does. The food is good, but normal. Nothing bad, but nothing amazing, besides the beer. Loved it, and I'm not even a beer fanatic!\nDave"
39797,3,"Absolutely killer flavors. Very impressed with this place. The taco selection is magnificent and the prices are affordable, and it's open late! If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.\nThe only reason I'm giving Tacos El Gordo four stars is because the line system can get pretty messy. It's not a big deal, just ask a worker or someone around you if you're confused about which line to wait in. All I'm saying is that a couple small signs above the ordering counters would make the line setup a whole lot better, and would earn this place a solid five stars."
6579,3,"What I love about this location over the two that I am used to in Milwaukee is the basement used vinyl section. The two in Milwaukee run their vinyl on the floor, completely packed. I always have to sit on the floor, pull some out, and move like 20 at a time.\n\nThis location has 75% of the stuff in bins that I can stand and pick through...and the best part is that there is no one in the basement, so you don't feel weird if you want to sit there for two hours literally looking through every album. I don't feel welcome to do that at the one on 76th st in Milwaukee."
1857,0,"Broke a pair of perscription sunglasses at the hinge.  Costco referred me to this place.  They did the repair by afixing new temples.  When I got them out into the sun, they didn't match the frames...the frames were black so it wasn't like it was some freaky color or pattern to match...just black.  When I took them back in to remedy the situation I was informed it was the best that they could do.\n\nA few weeks later the screw came out of the hinge, so I took it back.  I was informed that the policy of the store was not to do any repairs without charging for it....even resetting a screw, which I supplied.  \n\nHow much could it be to reset a screw you might ask? Would you believe $20.00!  I prefer to select who I let screw me, and this dump ain't one of them...."
21328,4,Love to watch movies and I love this theatre.  They have tons of options all of the time and really large theatres which makes it nice.  Always clean and lots of variety.
36980,3,"Loving this neighborhood froyo joint.  The topping selections are interesting and slightly different thatn some other places.  They have these yummy little chocolate rocks...kinda like candy coated chocolate shaped like rocks.  They were fun and tasty.  A nice assortment of topping sauces too...peanut butter, mallow, strawberry.  This place gets jam packed but they do have a good amount of seating both inside and out."
16263,4,"My favorite place to eat in Vegas.  My wife's favorite too!!  We are so happy another one opened around the corner from us, i guess that means I'll have to go to the gym more though."
2889,2,"Good Pizza,Calzones nothing exceptional.Shopping center wine bar."
26223,0,"Huge dissapointment. Service was lousy. It seemed like the waitstaff was completely untrained. Since I ordered the chicken parmesan, I felt like a side of pasta. The waiter let us know that \""chef\"" didn't allow sides of pasta. He reccomended that my girlfried and I split the $19 pasta entree. Well \""chef\"" had no right to not allow sides of pasta based upon how the rest of his food tasted. The chicken was overcooked to the point that it tasted burnt even under a layer of cheese. This wasn't even the worst part. The chicken parmesan was covered in so much garlic that not only could I not finish it, but it tasted more like garlic bread than the actual garlic bread did. Not impressed conisidering the amount of money I paid."
12342,4,My husband and I hotel hop for this birthday bash. So that weekend we decided to stay at three different hotels and one of which was Bellagio. This place is really nice and we came back again for the summer. It gets really crowded sometimes but it's all worth it because they have everything here. Love their buffet for dinner and the Cafe for brunch. My family are always here for the buffet and brunch whenever we are in the city. Can't miss it.
42019,0,"What a disaster for lunch.  Arrived at 12:20 for lunch with a party of 11 and when we got there we were the ONLY people on the whole restaurant.  This was a business lunch and a big party so you would think the place would pay attention to us. WRONG.  The waiter was a slow as molasses and once seated it took 10 minutes for him to bring us menus and take our drink orders. Again remember we were the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT!.   Finally after 20 minutes we order and our drinks some 35 minutes after we sat down.  Meanwhile the waiter and another guy were wiping tables and moving stuff on the patio. Who knows why, no one else was in the place.   After over 1 hour we get our food and several orders were wrong.  He does not apologize and challenges the person saying they changed the order and he brought the correct order.   Finally after over 2 hours we finished and it still took 10 minutes for the server to bring the bill.  No wonder this place was empty. Absolutely horrible service avoid this place like the plague. I will be sure to share this horrible with every possible person to let them know what. Horrible service, inconsiderate wait staff seems to be acceptable for this place. unless you have lots of time to sit and wait avoid this establishment.  Can i give them ZERO stars??? We finally walked out at 2:35!!!!  2:15 hours later....  Prior reveiwers are right that the MIA stands for the waiters being M.I.A."
14411,1,I was really looking forward to getting pizza from here as I've had it before and it was good.  So after looking at the menu I decided on a pie with two toppings sun-dried tomato's and hatch green chili's.  I ordered around 730pm and figured about a 30-40 minute wait.  At 840pm still had no pizza so I called and asked what the issue was.  Just then the driver called and asked for directions to my house.  I got the pie close to 9pm and the Pepsi was not really cold and the pie was far from hot.  So based on this experience a two star review because the pizza was good but for bad delivery and high cost for the poor service.
38879,2,"The food was good, portions huge, and there was a good variety on the menu.  However it took us an hour and 12 minutes from arrival to getting our food, even though the place wasn't full.  So worth it for the food quality and portions, but be prepared for a long wait to get it."
19969,0,"This was a second visit for me. I t had been a few years and last time I had a pretty good round. This visit was a bit surprising for me. First, they claim same day reservations as they are the largest spa in the country or the world. When I walked up for a service to be schedule later in the day between 12 and 4 I was told that most of the massage types I was requisition were not available and then I found one and then he said it was booked while we were talking. So, I ended up with just a general massage which was fine and he did give me 20% off for my troubles. Now, that is not really a big deal as this is an easy discount to get but I appreciated the effort. I think this was more of a staffing issue than anything else with the availability. \n\nWhen I got there ahead of time it took them quite a while to get me back so I had almost zero time to spend in the steam room and sauna. What I noticed that was different this time was that the massage rooms seemed to be almost like a cheap row of motel rooms. The massage was nothing stellar, just run of the mill. This is where the biggest disappointment would occur.\n\nI left my key ten miles back in the room. Now, I do not think there is any way you could remember which room you had been in. If there was, I never saw it. I asked the locker room attendant if he could help. He looked for my intake form and could not find it. Then, he just pawns it off on another employee who was very irritated to be bothered. Finally, when he found the slip which has been misfiled because the guy wrote hi T like an L or something he walked over to my locker and opened it and then just walked off. Now, this gave me no opportunity to shower or anything without leaving my locker open. Very poor service and frankly unacceptable. I will not likely return when in Vegas. \n\nI did want to bring this to a manager's attention on my way out but they had one person working the desk and a line of three folks and i had a dinner reservation to get to and now have to get to my room to shower."
48913,2,"I've walked by here during the day and never thought much of this little watering hole. On certain nights, however, there is live music to catch your attention. \n\nTo be honest, we only came here because our friend was part of the entertainment one night. The bar itself is a mixture of luxury and oddity. While seats and furniture are cozy and the lighting low the art displayed runs the gamut of interesting and enjoyable to strange and out of place. Take the lightbulb sculpture and chandelier; it an interesting non-functional talking point that highlights the confusing theme of the entire bar.\n\nAs far as selections; the bar is stocked, the waitresses knowledgable, a good selection of specialty drinks, and the bar tenders are well trained enough to make complex drinks to order.\n\nAt the same time, the drinks are not cheap. There is also no flat water available unless you're willing to pay $12 for one of the designer Voss bottles.\n\nIn honest, the drinks were good and I didn't mind paying a premium for them to watch my friend play guitar. But they're not so good that I'd keep coming back to the strangely decorated and overpriced place when considering the number of quality bars in Vegas."
9398,0,I was unsatisfied with all aspects of their customer service process. they did not explain things clearly. their policies are not meant to help you and i had a very unpleasant experience. save yourself the trouble and fly with rates so low. i would give zero stars if the option existed.
36446,2,"Good service, food was OK. I've tried the pancakes twice and how can I put this? There's no way around it, they're not good. They were burned the first time and both times hard and not very tasty. The basic fare (eggs, bacon, potatoes) were good but Biscuits will not be my first breakfast place choice."
45668,4,"I was pleasantly surprised that the fitness center was included with the Luxor room (the convenience fee covered the cost).  Even though I read this really fine print in the materials we received at check in.... I still expected to pay an additional fee like most other hotels on the strip.  Once I got over that, I was expecting a small 2 treadmill gym and man was I wrong!   This is a full gym with plenty of treadmills and stationary bikes, and 6 elliptical's.  There is a full set of free weights, bench press with it's own full set of weights.   Medicine balls (5), yoga mats, ab rollers, stair stepper, exercise balls, plenty of TV's positioned in front of the machines.  They had sanitary wipes to clean the machines before and after you used them.  They provided towels and water   I was really impressed, the Luxor got it right!  \n\nI posted lots of pictures!  The center is located in the West tower, casino floor level, inside the spa and near the pool.  If you're looking for it then you can't miss it. It was great to get a workout in with all these buffets around."
32977,1,"I ordered the T-bone and eggs. The food wasn't the best, especially hash browns and toast. The hash browns were extremely bland and a little burnt. Speaking of burnt, the toast was. One side was charred while the other was slightly burnt. As for the T-bone, i asked for medium and got well-cooked. It was dry but A1 sauce helped a little. The only safe thing was the eggs. But a little later I got a stomach ache. Although I wasn't happy  I gave a 2 star because I've had worse."
22693,2,"Cantina Laredo is a nice mexican restaurant.  If you like super salty chips you'll love these chips.  There are two different types of salsa, a cold and a hot.  The hot salsa has a smokier, spicier flavor than the cold.  Both are really tasty.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with sour cream poblano sauce.  They were ok at best.  The chicken had no flavor and the sauce was kind of bland.  The pinto beans were really good and the spanish rice was average.  My husband had the carnitas.  The meat was super tender and fell off bone.  He ordered a side of flour tortillas so he could make tacos with the meat.  He had a side of mixed vegetables that consisted of zucchini, red peppers and squash.  He said that they were seasoned perfectly, and he doesn't even like zucchini.  He also had a side of rice and a margarita.  All and all the meal was good and relatively cheap at only $45."
11362,4,"Came here a few nights ago for some brain food, and I guess I came in at the right time. I've heard stories about lackluster customer services but each experience that I've ever had has not been bad in any way like the \""others\"" say. Like forreal.\n\nIt wasn't busy that night, but they saw me park my car as they were cleaning up to pass the time and all the employees pretty much got up into position and waited for me as I was walking in. Kind of awkward, kind of nice to be appreciated. They all intently waited for me to make up my mind.\n\nI ordered the STEAK RICE BOWL with brown rice and veggies. By the time I was done paying for the order, they were practically almost done with my food. I was thanked for coming and it did feel genuine. I was pleasantly surprised that the services was so good.\n\nNow the fact that the food was cooked so quickly, I was hesitant, but the taste test proved otherwise as my food was delicious. I've come to this place before, one of my younger brothers used to work here and the quality of the food has always been very good. I don't usually go to other locations so I can't speak on their behalves, BUT this place never disappoints."
21848,0,"This place is terrible. The whole idea of the place is dumb; I'm not paying overpriced prices for bad service, bad jokes, and to be seated on a bench with other couples. I left before I ordered."
13920,0,Not bad. But if ur a dude. It doesn't matter what u spend. Bathroom line is ridiculous. Not worth the cover. If ur a dude. Don't come. .
15929,1,"I would MAYBE come here for happy hour and appetizers but we didn't enjoy our dinner at all. I ordered the chicken piccata and it came literally drowned in butter. I know it's a lemon butter sauce but it was ALL butter and very little lemon - and zero flavor. The broccolini was also drowned in butter. My husband ordered the veal porterhouse and guess what? It was drowned in butter. He said it was also flavorless. The other couple with were with ordered the baked ziti (HUGE!) and chicken Alfredo (HUGE!) and they weren't enamored either. The food was absolutely terrible, bland and heavy. Maybe their plain red sauces are where it's at, I don't know. The bruschetta was really good and the service was excellent as well - judging from the other reviews maybe we got lucky with a good waitress. Oh, and the valet situation - what a nightmare! Cars parked everywhere, stupid valet kid left someone door open while he ran around so no one could pass...cars totally bottle necked and stuck - it took us 15 minutes to get through and find parking!Total chaos."
19443,3,"I really like this place! It's small but I don't expect a grandiose atmosphere like some of the reviewers obviously wanted.  Like one said \""Go to P.F Changs for that\"".  I love the food here and the people! They are very nice and after you've been there a couple of times, they remember you.  Even when placing a phone order!  I have the house chicken, which is FANTASTIC! It is spicy but not so much that you can't even enjoy it.  They give you big portions, so one lunch special for $5.00 is enough for 2 servings.  $2.50 a serving?!? You can't beat that.  I can't really say anything about the oiliness of the food, since I do not find mine to be oily at all.  The food ALWAYS comes out HOT!  Some much so, that it can not be eaten right away. Never have I gotten my food in 2 seconds as one reviewer did and I eat there often.  If you are looking for good food that is not over priced and just want to eat and not worry about all the decor and what not, then you should give it a try!"
33225,4,"I visited Nikki for the first time last week and it was great.   She was able to match the Pink I had in my hair previously and get me taken care of an happy!  It did take a while since it was my first visit with her and we had to work a bit to get the match but she was totally amazing about it.  And now that we've got the formula we will be ready to rock my next appointment.  I also got a fabulous trim, first time in a long time I'm totally happy with a hair cut.  \n\nCheck out the salon, stop by and see Misty for a manicure, pedicure, or facial and see Nikki for a cut, color, or style. They're both fabulous!"

5251,0,"My dad took his small Maltese here a few months ago and it was the worst experience ever! First of all his haircut was awful and they only accepted cash. But the worst thing is that our dog was traumatized! He was shaking the whole day and started limping as if he had been beaten. He also had some small cuts and was not his playful self. We almost took him to the vet but decided to wait to see if he would get better. The shaking stopped the next day but he limped for couple days. I don't know what they did to him but it seemed like they grabbed him to harsh and hurt his legs. Be careful in taking your pets here! Also, since they only accept cash you don't even have any proof of your visit!"
3314,2,"We only ever get the Louisiana Chicken pasta or cheesecake any more.  I think the menu is so big that it is hard for them to have any specialties (other than cheesecake).  The last 5 dishes I've had have been nothing special at all, and one I even sent back because it was so bad (and I NEVER do that)."

14142,4,"******CASINO REVIEW ONLY******\n\nI've never stayed at the hotel so I'm writing this review strictly on the casino. It is by far my favorite casino in the Las Vegas area. Now, I should admit that I never play slots, and no, not because I think they're for \""suckers\"" I just don't enjoy them. (Let's be honest, if you gamble at all... you're a bit of a sucker... these places aren't made of solid gold for no reason :-) Back to business; right when I walked in, I knew that it was going to be my kind of place. It's never ridiculously crowded. The drink servers greeted me right away and took my order. The table limits allow you to play at the level YOU decide you are comfortable with. Also, if you're a dice player, this is the only casino in Nevada that I've noticed has a Fire Bet. There is a great, reasonably priced food court if you want to grab a bite to eat and don't feel like taking out a 2nd on your house. It really is the ONLY place I feel comfortable gambling at in Nevada. 5 stars for the Jolly Green Giant. \n\nRegards,\nCFC"
30889,0,"Gag, they used an old bucket of water to wash down the inside, it reeked.  I had to drive home with the windows down.  Moldy old water and they wash the inside with that same rag for the tires.  Awful.  It's hard to find this place on the very South side of the shopping complex.  Skip it."
24472,3,"Happy is the name of the game here. They have a pretty awesome happy hour and luckily, the hours aren't too limited, so I can actually make it in time. They also offer it on weekends and all day on Sundays during the football season. Sweet. \n\nI've always been a fan of Claim Jumper, one of the better chain restaurants around. Big portions and pretty tasty food. Desserts are good here as well. \n\nMy fella's not a fan, so I don't get here too often, but it's always a food option for HH."
40955,1,"I have had way better. The chips are boring. The regular salsa tastes like it was out of a jar or possibly just not seasoned very well. The hot salsa tastes like spicy ketchup got mixed into some salsa. The refried beans are probably canned (just judging by the way they curdle on the plate almost immediately) and the rice is nothing to write home about. I had the green chili burro enchilada style with green sauce. I'm not sure what in that was seasoned weird (possibly the sauce, but it may have been the green chili pork) and it just did NOT taste like Mexican food. I didn't really care for it at all and left 2/3 of my burrito untouched. \n\nMy mom goes there regularly and gets a burrito filled with veggies covered in red sauce. The red sauce is much better than the green sauce. The veggies taste awesome - especially the carrots - and she really like it. My step-dad gets a spinach enchilada which he really likes.\n\nI am not really keen on going here again. Everything but the veggies in my mom's burrito was so... bland.It did not taste like \""real\"" Mexican food to me. Not even Amercanized Mexican food. I am sure I will go again because my mom likes it, but I will be sharing her veggie burrito and staying far away from the green chili pork."
40765,4,"My bf and I were in town for the weekend and had dinner here last Saturday. The place is small, but WOW is it delicious! I'm almost embarrassed to say we went back three more times before leaving town. The miso soup has a great home made taste, along with the special rolls (lion, amigo, caterpillar, what the heck, and a few more I can't remember :/) even the house salad was amazing. The prices are great, I've paid a lot more for sushi from the big chain sushi restaurants, and in no way do they compare to sushi house."

The wax I get is advertised at $55 and up. I assumed mine would be $55 or $60. When I walked up to the desk to pay afterwards, my total was $75, before tip. I may have let myself go a bit but this seemed a bit high. It would have been nice to receive a little warning from the esthetician. \""Hey, I had to use extra wax to get everything so this one will cost you a bit more,\"" would have sufficed. After tip, this service ended up costing near $100. Seems a bit high for 15 minutes of their time."
48524,0,"Worst experience with any company I have ever dealt with. Nothing was completed when promised. Final deadline was missed. No estimates provided for any work. You have no idea what your budget is and when you ask you are not given any helpful information other than to go to the store and pick out like for like items. If you don't remember or know brands you are not provided any guidance. Regardless of whether you follow insurance allowances you will always be told you are over budget and need to pay out of pocket. Don't feel pressured to use this company, take your time and figure out how to do it on your own."

32579,1,"This is such a fun and unique bar. The wings are AMAZING! And the selection of beers is second to none. However, the service is complete and utter crap. I recently went to this bar and got a Guinness that was on special and I tasted it and almost spit it out, it tasted like straight gasoline! I told the bartender about it and she proceeded to argue with me that I didn't know what I was talking about. I couldn't finish the beer. Guinness for the record is my favorite beer. She proceeded to ignore me and my group for the rest of the night and we had to ask the poor food runner to get out checks for us. Needless to say I will think twice before ever going here again."

Even though Bobby was at home making dinner and I'm dieting, I still was hungry and needed food. \n\nI ordered the teriyaki chicken from Asia Tea House.

44256,1,"Been getting their menu in the mail and been looking for a good, local pizza joint. I love pizza, that and a beer is one of my favorite meals. I called in an order for pick up and it was ready in the time they gave me, I think 25 minutes.\n\nThe pizza is overall.... Ok? I ordered pepperoni and extra cheese and the amount of cheese seemed a little less than \""extra.\"" The pepperoni and everything tasted pretty good. I especially like the crust, it's on the thinner side but not too thin and was really tasty. Although I know pizza isn't an especially healthy choice, this one was rather greasy, which was a big turn off to my boyfriend. Also it really falls apart the further into the slice I got, eventually completely coming apart from the fat crust at the end. Between the grease and fall-apart quality this makes for a messy pizza experience.\n\nOverall I have mixed feelings. It definitely wasn't bad pizza but not great either. My boyfriend also ordered a calzone and thought it was \""boring.\"" Gonna keep looking for a good local pizza joint."

But ultimately, the 4 stars are for the drinks. Cherry and strawberry limeades, watermelon slushy.. the possibilities are endless. This place is a nice treat when the weather gets warm!"
44415,4,"I honestly cannot remember the last service call I have made of any kind which went nearly as well as this. As consumers, we always hope for the best but expect the worst. Robert certainly turned that thinking around. He was prompt, courteous, knowledgeable, and willing to explain exactly what was wrong and what his recommendations were. \n\nI will definitely recommend Dukes of Air to everyone I know, and should the need arise in the future, I won't hesitate for a second to call upon their services again. THANK YOU!"
46268,4,"Absolutely love the food and service. Everything is always fresh and high quality. Can't beat the lunch specials and the portions are shareable. I havn't found anything that I don't like, I've tried."
9053,3,"This visit received a prompt greeting by the hotess/manager after efficient service, food in a timely manner, and as we ordered it. Restrooms were well kempt. And as Forrest Gump says...\""that's all I got ta say about that.\"""
4344,3,"For the price, it's not a bad deal. I got the wings today. 9 of them plus rice and a small amount of mac salad. I normally get the seafood combo. It comes with mahi mahi, teriyaki chicken, and shrimp. I always tell them to delete the shrimp and give an extra piece of fish. Normally the fish is thick, moist and good. Last time over cooked and dry. The teriyaki chicken always good. The shrimp always horrible. Don't get it. Too thin, too much bread, too dry. Step back from their shrimp. \nAll in all, the chicken always good and the mahi mahi most times good. Not great. But good, and enough of it."
27930,4,Love this place! The gyros are delicious along with the honey fried bread AND chicken Caesar pita! Definitely happy to have this in my neighborhood!
13264,3,"Wow! This was impressive. Absolutely loved the decor, although I think we went there too early. Around 7pm and the place was barely getting going, then again, it is Vegas. We would have gone later but had a show to catch. The food however was fantastic. We had kobe flat iron steaks. They melt in your mouth. Also, the truffle oil macaroni and cheese was to die for. The tableside  ceasar was spicy! Not sure why, but it was still cool to have someone come to your table and make everything by scratch in front of you. Definitely recommend the goat cheese and truffle oil bak lava. Very rich experience."
5291,0,"The only reason I called Molly Maids was because we got a coupon in the mail for them and my mother was coming to visit.  The first issue I had was that the number on the coupon didn't even work so I had to google them to get a working number.  I made an appointment for Saturday morning on a Tuesday.  Saturday rolls around, no call, no maids.  I call and get ahold of a \""Kate\"".  She proceeds to tell me that my appointment was lost or never properly recorded in their system.  When I asked her how they were going to make this right, she got attitude and raised her voice to me.  I asked for the manager and she tells me that she's the owner and she's the only one in the office on Saturdays......G-H-E-T-T-O  Don't waste your time with this terribly run \""organization\"".  (if you can even call it that).  My friend from back home told me that the main company is going out of business all over the country.  Now, I can see why."
41727,0,***WARNING****\nDO NOT EVER go to this club!! WORST club I've ever been to. The girls there are hideous and fat. There is a dancer there named Suzy Q that smells so bad. She left the stench of stinky underarm on the sleeve of my shirt when she sat down on me. I almost bought the deodorant out of the vending machine to give to her. Most all of the girls are very unfriendly and lazy. They have great drink specials but that is the only good thing about that club but I wouldn't recommend this club to my worst ememy.
401,1,"My husband and I visited the Dunhill, originally planning to spend our wedding night there. They are historic, quaint, and conveniently located in Charlotte. Walking in to the check-in desk was a breeze. Everyone was very friendly. Walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel. It really could use some restoring. The hotel room was small, bathroom was small as well (though they've tried to modernize it with decoration & hardware), and just overall underwhelming. The ceiling had many water spots where water had leaked from above and dried the ceiling yellow. They also have a restaurant in the hotel with good eggs benedict, but for the price, I wasn't impressed. Again, friendly, great historic hotel (which I normally love), but didn't live up to its reputation for us. (We visited before our wedding and booked a room at the Ritz, which in Dunhill's defense, was brand spankin' new.)"
30197,4,First time here! Food is good and customer service very good! Price is good! Love it!
14493,1,"Meaty. Markety. Should be ladies night everynight--there were some incredibly tireless, strong and fun women who seemed to love their music--knew all the lyrics. They made  my night! Save the adorable security staff, men didn't really dance, except for a few who didn't know how to put down their drink--it's a DANCE CLUB. Are those boys there for themselves? Priority for me: first is the dance. Enjoying atmosphere/scenery is second--and scouting is a far third. Go to Axis Radius to be, have and behold some grope and ogle. Reminds me of Borderline, in Chicago--closed now, i think. They serve as the after bar party--but that means to me, they should be open til 4am--if it were not for Scottsdale law, eh?"
49152,3,"I am so glad I capped off 3 days in a row and 3 shows with Olivia!  She is my father's celebrity crush and when we found out she was debuting her show the last night he was in town, I got tickets during the pre-sale.  We got in line about 30 minutes before the show, which starts at 7:30 PM.  This is the same showroom that features Donny & Marie and George Wallace.\n\nWhile waiting in line, I realized I was perhaps 3 decades younger than everyone else, but what the heck!  We had balcony seats at a table.  We sat with a couple from Ontario, Canada.  Olivia was very conversational with the audience and had a band complete with a percussionist, bassist, drummer, and back-up vocalists, one of which played a variety of instruments including the fabulous flute, saxophone, and even harmonica.\n\nThe female back-up vocalist also helped Olivia with the majority of her on-stage costume changes, which was changing jackets primarily.  She only did one costume change at the end of the show before a 2-song finale, wearing head-to-toe gold sequins.\n\nShe sang songs from all aspects of her career, pre-Grease and post-Grease.  She is an Aussie who moved to England at 18 and sang in lounges.  She sang songs she was inspired by, like \""Cry Me a River\"" by Julie London (in V for Vendetta for my generation).  Olivia sang from Xanadu, from her country hits in her early days, songs from her 90s album Gaia, and of course...PHYSICAL!\n\nThe most excitement for the crowd came from her 4 minute montage of her life early in the show, with pictures hinting at the order of her career, and the nod to Grease.  She started with a tease of \""Look at me I'm Sandra Dee\"" and then broke into songs from Grease with her back-up singers: You're the One That I Want, Hopelessly Devoted to You, Summer Nights, and We Go Together.  The crowd went wild!  Sure, there were songs throughout the show I did not know, but I did not grow up with ONJ so I was just thrilled to see my dad so happy.  Cool show no matter what generation you belong to, I'd say!"
41113,0,"First, the service was very bad. The bartenders were DRINKING after the customers and the OWNER was sitting there with them socializing and DRINKING his own beer.  It was hard to believe even after seeing it.\n\nMy girlfriend tried the Key Lime Pie Martini.  It was WAY too strong and the sugar on the rim was gooey and running down the glass. It was impossible to even drink half of it. \n\nFor my self, I ordered the Blueberry Mojito and it was disgusting. It was the equivalent of biting down onto a mint leaf with every sip, I could barely stand it. Should rename it the \""Extra extra Mint Mojito\""\n\nBasically, we gave it a try and we won't be back."
35464,0,"dirty all the time, food never cooked right, people do not speak english, need to\nget the playground out of there, kids run all over the place, screaming, and they\nwalk around without shoes, they let anyone use the bathroom and most of the time\npeople from the outside are using the bathrooms to take a bath in."
40801,1,I had a craving for good BBQ and this was a disappointment. Ordered $35 worth of food and did not enjoy most of it. The pulled pork was okay. The brisket was mediocre. The chicken was okay. The beans were under cooked and pretty bad. Threw that away. The sauces were decent. I just ended up asking my father in law to make some brisket since I couldn't find anyone to buy some good southern style brisket. \n The staff was extremely nice and the place is really clean. Inside and a little outside seating. The portions were really small though so I was not impressed.
6270,3,"I think i just got 10x cooler and more hipster jut walking in the door! This is a really cool funky little place that has everything from beer and wine, to toys, candy, and quirky gifts. You can hang out there in some small seating areas, and even order food. Worth it just to come in and look around even if you dont need anything!"
40121,0,Went for Mj vs. Prince event 1/4. I had high hopes for this and I was really let down. The event did not even start til after 11pm on a Friday night (hello most peeps have worked all day.) The pre-dj was better than the mj vs. Prince dj only thing is that he wasn't allowed to play any of music we paid to hear. Sad part is that many people left after waiting so long because they were tired of waiting. This event had a ton of patrons and could been a blast. Instead I was walking out by midnight. Hopefully another establishment will take on this genre and revamp the idea!
37302,0,Horrible. From the price of juice and milk for kids to the moldy grapes that laid on my food and I mean white mold. Disgusting. Lost my appetite. Service is very very slow and there was only 5 tables. For a place that had steak in their name my daughter did not eat her steak and eggs as it was a horrible peace of cheap sirloin. We live a block a way and will never go back again.
34797,4,"I also had Broken Lemon Tart which consisted of yuzu parfait, frozen shortbread, pistachio puree, compact watermelon, and coconut jelly. This was fun, light and each item had a distinct unique flavor. \n\nAs all good culinary opera's must end, so must this one and it did with my signature doppio espresso with a twist. In keeping with the spirit of the rest of the evening, this near perfect espresso was accompanied with a delicious collage of petifores, (Fudge cheesecake, honey of raisin granola, honeycomb tuile & tanka bean ice cream). I mean seriously how often does one get to eat tanka bean ice cream. This dish was actually the best desert I had this night and it was served on a groovy piece of drift wood. Which reminds me, everything from the preparation, presentation, service and taste at Hawke & Hunter was above and beyond my expectations. I have been to several places that boast food of this level but fail to deliver. Hawke and Hunter was quite the opposite. They didn't boast but they sure did deliver. \n\nBravo!\n\n(Pictures are available for all these dishes on the Hawke & Hunter Yelp link)"
2638,2,"Let me start out by saying that I'm not a Trader Joe's fan, but after a recent debate about grocery stores where a friend really stood her ground about it having such great prices, I figured I would suck it up and give this location a try. It's located in a strip mall (surprise!!) with the worst parking lot ever, so I didn't really know what to expect. My only other TJ experiences have been in Center City Philadelphia (gross) and a stand-alone in a suburban Seattle neighborhood.\n\nThis store is really clean. I went on a Sunday afternoon so it was fairly crowded, but the shelves were stocked and it was pretty easy to maneuver around. If I had a cart it might be another story but I grabbed a basket and went up and down each aisle a couple times. The only messy area was the bathroom but I probably just caught it in between cleaning shifts. \n\nNot knowing what I was looking for, I picked up a couple items for dinner and snacks for the kids. Yogurt tubes - good price. English muffins - good price and probably the best I have ever had. Orange Chicken (frozen) - could have been spicier but the kids loved it. Meat dept - expensive...better prices at Sprouts. Frozen blueberries - cheapest around. All-in-all it was a good experience, I was pleasantly surprised, and I started drafting my \""okay, you win\"" text to my friend who stood her ground and I headed to the register.\n\nI stood in line and when I was my turn, I told my cashier that I had a bag. This is where they get docked 2 stars. For the amount of time it takes to ring up the 7 items that I had, my cashier made not one, not two, but five smart-ass comments about the fact that I had a Whole Foods bag. I know, I know, what a dumb thing to get bent over, but for me it has to do with service, and Roger (cashier), should just bite his tongue, keep his opinions to himself, and just be happy that I am contributing to his ability to receive a paycheck. I know the $22 I spent is just a teeny-tiny percentage of what the store brings in on a normal day, but because of that interaction, I won't go out of my way to shop there, even if it means saving a couple bucks."
6323,2,"I thought Taipei express was pretty damn good.  The shrimp in the Shrimp Lo Mien were plump and nicely browned, and there were plenty in my order.  The Sesame Chicken was juicy and the sauce was sweet and tangy.  I did not eat too much of the browned rice, but the chicken wings were crunchy, salty, meaty and tasty, especially with a splash of mustard and duck sauce.  The dumplings were massive, the biggest I've ever seen.  They were a little doughy, but the pork inside was nicely seasoned, and the sauce was delicious.  \n\nThe orders were large as well.  I ate my fill last night, and still had enough Lo Mien left to have a nice sized lunch today.  For the money I'd say Taipei Express is a great deal, true its not gourmet, but it is good... the portions are large and the prices are reasonable.  I have to disagree with Jason L. on this one and give Taipei Express a thumbs up, try it for yourself, and let us know what you think."
3272,3,Decent breakfast and service. Cute little restaurant. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing!
42415,3,"This is a great place for lunch in the Quartier Latin (Ste-Catherine St.) area, near Berri-UQAM. I go there often for lunch. Service is quick, food is healthy and tasty. There is a choice of at about 10 different salads (greek, pasta, Asian, mango + bell peppers, spinach, apple, potatoes, legumes, cabbage) and as many sandwiches (mostly paninis, but also wraps, and they have many vegetarian options). They also have baked goods (muffins, croissants, biscottis, cookies, cakes...). I like their combos (I usually have sandwich + 2 salads + drink for 11$ taxes included). They also have one or two kinds of soups. They serve coffee and expresso drinks but they only have decaf in espresso drinks (which is not included in the combo, but I got away with a decaf Americano). There is a lot of people who take the food away so even if it's often busy, I never had trouble sitting down, even right around 12pm. I wish the cutlery were re-usable (instead of disposable). But it's one of the best deals in the area, with a wide variety of choice for lunch."
36035,2,"Gets a 3 instead of 4 because its only a shadow of places like Portillo's, Al's Beef, Wolfies, etc etc.\n\nHot dogs are great, piled high with hot peppers, onions, relish and tomatoes.   Isn't grilled enough, as far as I can tell.\n\nCorn beef and pastrami, however, are disappointing.  They store portions in the fridge/freezer, stuff them in individual rolled bags, and have like 10-15 of them in huge ziploc backs.  Take them out to cook; not impressed.  \n\nOverpriced and heated the marble rye is soggy, and the meat wasn't really great.  \nWill go for hot dogs though man.  Delicious."
37580,1,"After reading several reviews, I decided to go here for a pedicure. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed. I was expecting the usual massage chair and jet foot bath. Not here. They fill up a small tub and stick your feet in it while you're sitting in a make-shift pedicure chair. The \""lounge\"" is not a lounge what so ever. It's a tiny, closet sized room. It's only you and the person doing your nails in the room at one time. And it's a good thing because you couldn't fit another person in there!\nThe place was very clean and professional looking and I greatly enjoyed the nail technician and the conversation we had. But for the price, you can go somewhere else and get a much better pedicure..."
9446,0,"I have NEVER done this, but this place was deserving. I went in for lunch at 11am. The was almost a 1:1 ratio servers:patrons. It took a while for someone to acknowledge that I was sitting at a table, but once he did, he promptly took my order and even suggested the sauce on the side. So, I thought, \""OK....this might work\"" however that is where it ended. 15 minutes later, he must have sensed my lack of patience because he told me that my meal would be right....they were waiting for the chicken. I ordered a chicken teriyaki rice bowl. Now, how long does something like this take??!!! (and where was the chicken coming from??) \n\nEvidently, too long. I got up and walked around the corner to Starbucks, got my coffee and a sandwich and on my way back....still no meal at the table. It is unfortunate that the server has no idea if I left or went to the bathroom. I really wanted to talk to the manager, but I was at a conference on a limited break and he was wandering around a bit bewildered. \n\nGiven all of the other reviews that are even worse than this one, they really should do something about the management - this was not really the server's fault."
3332,2,"I happend to find this place as I was itching for some sake and left very satisfied. \n\nGrub a dub- I find it sometimes hard to eat asian food , unless sushi or sashimi is involved, because I always feel so full after, but this place is different , slightly smaller portions , with fitting prices. The hot and sour soup intantly became greatness to me.\n\nService- I guess i went at a weird time as I was the only one in the place , so every thing came out fast and hot.But you can tell the server was about to leave and kept rushing away to do her final things.:(\n\nThe Get up- kinda standard look to the place , blacks and red stark asain decor . nothing new or stand out. but not cheesy either.\n\nAll in all, ill go again but probably wont suggest it when headed out with friends."
17851,3,"Another one of my finds thanks to my time spent at IP's poker room. The lunch special is what got our attention, actually -- a giant slice of yummy pizza (don't get two slices unless you've an appetite of pro-football star proportions) for just a couple bucks. \n\nIt's a teeny-tiny little Italian restaurant, with checkerboard tabletops and comfy booths. The service is fast and friendly. I tend to catagorize it in my mind of being strictly a pizza joint, but the menu is actually much more extensive than that. They serve a chicken Caesar sandwich that's pretty good, though I vaguely remember the chicken being of the McNugget variety. They do have a little salad bar which offers plenty of tasty veggies and a couple meats, and a low-fat Italian dressing that I honestly can't taste the low-fattiness. It's thick and flavorful, just as it should be."
24518,1,"Fairview Grill has changed its name to Lucky Louie's. So what? The service is still horrible. The food is mediocre at best and their beer list is short. I went there last night for dinner and drinks with a friend and walked out sick to my stomach from the food. Even had to pull out the Pepto-Bismol when I got home. \n\nThe Food...\n\nWings: If you get wings, stay away from the Jerk sauce, it sucks. The Barbalo sauce was decent.\n\nSides: I got the buffalo fries with a side of ranch for dipping and I must say they were tasty...very tasty!\n\nBurger: I got the Bacon Cheeseburger and ate about half of it. I prefer my burgers to be well-done and should have mentioned that so I guess that's my fault. However, the bacon was not crispy at all and they didn't even have A1 Sauce for me.\n\nLucky Louie's does have a couple of redeeming qualities though:\n\n1) Very Nice Golden Tee and Silver Strike Bowling Machine\n2) Pool Tables\n3) Projector Screen in front plus plenty more flat-screen TV's positioned correctly throughout the bar\n4) They carry the NFL Network\n\nWill I go back? Probably not unless forced to. Especially not for the food."
29618,3,"Hands down the best Thai Restarunt in Las vegas, definitely worth checking out if u love Thai food, the portion sizes are good, great location, with great prices. Customer services is good. It can be better but I don't mind it because the food is execellente"
426,2,"This place seems to be going a tad downhill. Super disappointed that the drink specials went up. The waiter was super nice, but the service was slow. If you do go, then sit downstairs...it seems that they had better service. Well drinks on Fridays are $5.00 and not worth it. Pizza was decent and the spinach artichoke dip was pretty awesome."
1871,4,"Where has this place been all my life?\n\nBest burger on this side of town. I'd recommend the full-size burgers over the sliders, which, while still delicious, somewhat pale in comparison.\n\nGenerous portions for a very reasonable price.\n\nWhen I worked close by, I'd try to eat here once a week for a daily special that I liked."
16119,2,If Spearmint Rhino and Treasures were siblings then Spearmint Rhino would be Charlie Sheen and Treasures would be Emilio Estevez. Spearmint Rhino is a lot more fun with a lot more going on. Treasures is small and booooooring. Bottle service is a lot cheaper though.
20755,3,"Good food, service , in a cozy atmosphere."
6847,0,"I really want to like this place, but I've had a bad experience every time I've ordered from them. A few weeks ago, I ordered delivery from Nam's and my food took almost an hour longer than the estimated arrival time. When I finally received my food, there was a curly black hair sitting directly on top of my curry. Luckily, I still had my crab rangoons and I was able to eat those, but I certainly had no appetite for the curry... I called Nam's as soon as I found the hair and was told by the employee that answered the phone that he would \""leave a note\"" about getting me a free entree next time I ordered from them. Well, I just ordered food from them again and received a very rude phone call from one of the workers demanding to know why I was receiving a free entree. Let's just say that I am a little insulted that, after I gave them a second chance, they would call me and accuse me of lying to get free food. \n\nSide Note: After being reassured that my food would be here in 45 minutes, it has now been an hour and I am officially never ordering from here again."
48733,2,"Ark is OK.  I've had better rentals from hertz and also a local company Verve  http://www.VerveCarRental.com  They do cash car rentals in Las Vegas to like Ark does them.

43704,0,"The worst fish and chips I have ever eaten.\n\nThings were looking good when I arrived:  the feel was authentic, the menu said the fish and chips were batter-dipped as opposed to breaded, they brought me malt vinegar without me having to ask after I ordered , and the fish even looked pretty on the plate when they sat it down.\n\nBut when I started to eat it things were wrong fast.  At first, I thought there was fish roe in my fish because there was goey orange stuff inside.  Gross.  Then I realized that was liquid, uncooked batter.  Then I poked around at the other two pieces of fish.  All three were swimming in 1/4 to 1/3 of inch of doughy, undercooked, and in case liquid batter.  It was inedible.  When I scraped it off, the fish underneath was not particularly attractive, nor do I believe that it was either halibut or cod as I believe the menu promised.\n\nAvoid."
308,3,"Just around the corner from my work, me and a few coworkers came looking for some play!  We went early and got a cush spot on the top floor with the window.  Clearly it's a hot spot in the neighborhood because it was packed by 7 pm on a Tuesday?!  The outside seating area was buzzing even in the chilly fall weather.  \n\nThe first quenching sip of that half-price RASPBERRY COSMO and I was sold!  Add on some true \""Pittsburgh\"" food (I'm talking about putting fries in a salad, oh yes!) and other yummy munchies like a super stuffed chicken quesadilla and our fun time was complete!"
27062,3,"I've often popped in here for coffee at the weekend as it tends to be a bit quieter than the rest of George Street. It is a stunning building and correct me if I'm wrong, a former bank? Anyway I've never been for dinner (yet) but the menu always looks tempting.\n\nLast night a small posse of us trooped in for hot chocolate. It won't be the cheapest hot chocolate in town but it is bloody awesome. A cup full of melted chocolate with milk on the side - I went hardcore and passed on the milk. It was fantastic - pure, lush, melted chocolatey goodness and just the treat on a blowy Edinburgh night. Centotre even made us fresh cupcakes incase we wanted some sweet treats (did you think we would say no?!) and even made a GF option which looked exactly the same as the other girls cakes.\n\nSo, fab hot chocolate and after this, I really want to go back and have dinner now, with maybe a wee hot chocolate to round off the meal..."
33062,0,I will never bring my stuff here again!! They send their stuff out to clean so they TAKE NO REPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR CLOTHES.  If you care about the things you buy I would go somewhere else

I have to remind myself sometimes that I don't live by the ocean anymore and very few restaurants here in the valley provide good quality seafood dishes along the lines of the paella.\n\nIt was mediocre and I know many other things I have had at Havana Cafe are much better.\n\n:-( \n\nI'll just have to bank on my upcoming dinner at Wildfish for Restaurant Week to set me right.

6535,1,The place is under construction so VERY limited seating.  Was very cold inside.  Very dark lighting as most fixtures were missing.  holes in ceiling and walls torn apart.  Some guy at the bar in camouflage seated us and took waitress almost 10 minutes to greet us.  There was only one other couple in the place.  Food wasn't terrible but lacked flavor.  Decent prices but the Greek music was competing with the country radio station that was blaring in the bar area.  Was just really weird!!!!!
31142,3,"Awesome, authentic Mexican cuisine.  Great service and $1 beers, what could be better."
28061,0,Absolutely the WORST club I have EVER been too. Service was horrible and they must be desperate for funds because the club was way over capacity. I love going out but I will not be returning here.
18927,3,"My husband and I have been to this Black Angus about half a dozen times in the past year. The service is always excellent but the food has been hit or miss. It was a Friday night and he was craving a burger, but not the normal fast food burger, I wasn't. So we decided on Black Angus, close to the house and they have a kids menu.  \n\nIt was about 6 and the restaurant was not busy, no wait..on a Friday..made us think here we go again..The hostess sat us quickly and the server said he would be right back, waited about 5 minutes and he came back to take our drink order. When he brings our drinks we order our entrees' the Steakhouse Burger, fries & garden salad for the hubs, 6 oz filet, loaded baked & garden salad for me, the child decided he wanted mac & cheese. Salads arrived quickly with the complimentary loaf of bread.  Salads were nothing to write home about but the bread was hot and fresh baked. Entrees' arrived shortly after. Husbands burger looked awesome and he said it tasted great. The fries were the average frozen type. My steak was cooked to perfection, hot and pink on the inside with the right amount of seasoning. The potato was picture perfect but could have used a tad more butter, the meal as a whole will get no complaints from me. The child's mac & cheese was classic Kraft's, he ate it eagerly waiting to get that sundae that comes with each kid's meal. \n\nThe service was outstanding, we never had dirty dishes nor did our  beverages run dry. Our waiter was polite and made conversation. The food was above average. \n\nIf Black Angus could nail it every time like they did on the last visit it would be a favorite on our list."
30680,4,"WONDERFUL!!! I can't say enough about it. What a beautiful little gem of a restaurant. I received a gift certificate from a friend for Christmas. I had never been, and was excited to go. It is a tiny little place, but they manage to seat more than you'd think could fit in the space. Such a calm, relaxing atmosphere. The food is gorgeous from start to finish...it looks gorgeous, smells gorgeous, and tastes gorgeous! I savored every bite like it was my last. I took an out of town friend there for dinner and he loved it! Exclaimed over everything and said it was the best Thai he'd had in a long time, and he lives in Atlanta. The hostess/waitress is so lovely. She answered all of my questions about the menu, recommended dishes, and even adjusted the spiciness of a dish to my liking (I craved more spice!). The soup is to die for! A glorious experience all the way around. All I can say is go, go, go!"
7370,2,"We have a problem every time we go to Claim Jumper. I'm ready to give up. Last night I got the Grilled Chicken Pasta. They forgot to put the sauce on. It was supposed to have garlic olive oil on it. I told the server and he said he would bring it on the side. What he brought was not garlic olive oil, it was water based with lots of seasoning. So I went ahead and used it and it was not good. Only ate half the dish. We ordered the brownie for dessert. It is NOT a brownie, it's a piece of cake. I don't know if they ran out of brownies, or that's their brownie. But we were very disappointed with that. We ordered extra ice cream to go with it. That came separately just as we finished the dessert - thanks. On previous  visits to this location we've had to return dishes because they're barely warm, etc. Something every time. The only reason we come here is because we get gift cards..."
7806,3,"Great place!\nI've never had to wait very long for a walk-in, maybe 20 mins at most. \nThe staff is friendly and does a great job.\nPrices are consistent with similar salons.\n\nParking can be tough in this shopping center, but that isn't the fault of the salon."
35962,1,"I've only been here once, so I don't know if this is a common problem or they were having a particularly off night, but the service was ridiculously, unacceptably slow. It was not a big crowd; several of the tables around us were empty, even. Drinks took so long that we began to doubt whether we had ordered them at all. Drinks ordered at the same time sometimes arrived 10 minutes apart (and these were not complicated, umbrellaed drinks - just beers and ciders and sodas).\n\nThe cheese plate I ordered was fine. I'm guessing it consisted of young, fresh cheeses when my order went in, but by the time it arrived at the table they were all nicely aged. The person sitting next to me (who shall remain nameless) ordered the fishiest fish pie that I ever did smell. \n\nThe waiter, when we did see him, was friendly enough. Plus I think he was the first kilted waiter we've had in Edinburgh, which seems like some sort of important cultural milestone, right? Or maybe not.\n\nI feel like Ghillie Dhu has the potential to be much better than 2 stars, but not for the experience we had last night."

31025,1,"We went to Rustic Cafe today for breakfast because we saw that it had a 4 star rating.  Normally, yelpers are right in their assessments of restaurants.  This, hoewever, was not the case.  My hubby and I both got omelettes.  They were both filled with stuff, but quite greasy.  The hasbrowns on my hubby's plate were cold.  We were both frankly quite underwhelmed by this place.  The price point was good.  I am a stickler for tasty OJ at a breakfast place, thus I am taking a star away for the sole reason that the OJ was obviously from concentrate.  I don't even drink OJ from concentrate at home.  Why would I pay $3 for it?"
14210,0,"Watched Dita Von Tease at House of Blues. May 17th 2012 : The show started 20 minutes late, since it is standing room only tickets at $45-55 a pop and we had to arrive at least 30 minutes early so it is not very pleasant. A total of 50 minutes standing time and some audiences were sitting on the dirty floor... Once the show started it was disappointing and not worth the wait at all. What a waste of life and time this was! I didn't know a fat woman twirling nipple tassels is entertainment!? The MC told us the more we drank the better the show becomes and prettier the women too. I understand HOB started the show late so they can sell more drinks, but it is not fair to the audiences. Only thing nice about that place is the chandelier, I had the chance to stare at it for 50 minutes."
16382,4,"Very good vietmanese sandwiches! Good price for a good sized sandwich, I had the grilled pork one. The only downside is the location and all the potholes in the parking lot. Worth the effort though."
42485,0,"This place really sucks. Wish it would get out of Lawrenceville. No character, terrible food, and rude servers. Belongs in Station Square with the drunk suckers."
5486,2,"This is a good sushi bar.  Other reviews say the fish is fresh and they weren't joking.  Its a small place with not much ambience, but if you're going there for good sushi, you won't be disappointed."
37472,4,"I agree with the positive reviews of this spa.  I had a massage there last week, and it was very clean, and the massage was great.  I was glad I got to keep my clothes on, and the masseur put towels over my clothes to protect them from the lotion on his hands when he massaged my back.  Though it was a little painful at times, I didn't ask him to lighten up the pressure, because I wanted to see how I felt afterward.  My feet were in heaven for over a day!  The price was great.  I will be back, and bring friends with me."
32161,3,Get there before rush hour so you can miss the traffic. \n\nThe staff is the only reason I can't give this 5 stars. They seemed pre occupied. You don't want to seem like this when  you are getting stuck with needles. It just is a bit upsetting. \n\nThe mobile team is awesome though.
26968,3,"Had curry noodles with chicken, as spicy as they make it. It was pretty spicy, but I wasn't crying and sweating from my forehead like a few of the other good pad Thai places around Vegas. Chicken and vegetables were fresh and simple. I will have this again for sure. Eat it with chop sticks,everything just falls off the fork. \nVery nice atmosphere, very friendly, extremely attentive staff."
9756,2,"The Salmon Sunshine Roll will forever be my favorite roll. OMG so delicious~!!! Salmon, tuna, sriacha & lemon... what more could you ask for?\nYou wouldn't think that this little Chinese/sushi joint at the Orleans would have fresh fish but man their stuff is GOOD!\nThe hamachi kama with a side of sushi rice is also a winner in my book!\n\nAs for the Chinese food I really like their dry chow fun, Singapore Street Noodles,  double pan fried noodles and their seabass tofu hot pot~!!! \n\nAs for service everyone has always been really nice.. Especially the cute cashier/hostess Songyi ;]]] \n\nI would give them 4 stars but their food is pretty overpriced ...it's in a casino of course.. So I suggest you find someone who gambles a lot and make them buy you dinner here using their comps.. LOL"
23557,3,In a pinch you can always count on Ace Hardware!\n\nI needed some stake tape for my tomato plants and it was a tomato emergency so off to Ace I went.. being that its my local neighborhood store you'd think I would have been in here before. The Mr LOVES this place and is constantly making up reasons to go here.. I think he just likes the Ace points for discounts on future purchases.. anyhoo.. they had the tape and my tomato plants were saved from ruin! \n\nThank you Ace!! You're my neighborhood hero!
11682,1,"It's been said that \""It's the little things that count.\"" While true, it neglects to mention how important the big things are.  Barrio Caf\u00e9 is a perfect example of the limitations of this maxim.\n\nYou see, Barrio Cafe nails the little things: great art, horchata served in empty Mexican coke bottles, banana leafs on plates, a fantastic mural, pomegranate seeds in the guacamole, a very enjoyable adobo flavored ketchup, a hip ambience, a smartly dressed wait staff - all very well done and deserving of stars.\n\nWhere the house of cards crumbles is when the food hits the mouth.  My cochinita pibil sandwich, recommended by the waiter and a signature dish, could only be described as bland.  Served atop two plodding pieces of thick French bread - it made me long for the powerfully flavorful and soft bites at Tortas El Guero down the street.\n\nBC has been out for a while and has a reputation in the area as a winner - maybe their food quality has slipped with a change of chef.  \n\nUntil the eats get better, barrio cafe will remain, to me, just a place that gets the little things right.  \n\nTwo little stars"
25866,1,"Meh .\nDa Emma has now officially joined the ranks of \""just any other Italian restaurant\"" in Montreal.\n\nThis used to be my favourite Italian restaurant in Montreal. I would make it a must stop for everything from birthdays to wedding anniversaries, to graduation fetes. I'm not quite sure what happened here. :(\nBetween getting cold (yes, COLD) pasta sides to getting a different side from the one that I had ordered, albeit without even having been told. All the way to not even getting acknowledged half the night by our server (I had to flag him down most of the time. Really?! When many main dishes are over $40, why am I running after servers?) To getting bottled water when it was never even requested. I had even asked to get another table in the restaurant (as it was pretty much half empty) and the table I asked for didn't even have a \""reservation\"" sign on it. No big deal, right? Wrong. I was awkwardly told \""Sorry, we save that other two-spot table in case we have to push two sets together for a party of four\"". Okay, that's fine.\nKnow what happened? \nThey pushed the tables together alright - for another couple. They had their nice big spot and we stayed put. What happened to saving it for a party of four? Am I missing something here?... \nWhat a disappointment. Cold food is never okay. Off nights happen, but it won't change that I'm likely not going to go back. Having been to many top restaurants in New York City like Babbo, Del Posto and Scarpetta, I'd say Da Emma should re evaluate their service. Times are tough, people! If you want to keep charging your exorbitant prices you better make it worth the customers' time and money. What a shame."
37390,3,"Compared to some other reviews on here, I'd argue that Doodles really isn't that overpriced. You can get a pretty filling lunch here for 5 bucks or under. Additionally, the add-ins they give you with your ramen are served in substantial portions. The add-ins themselves are of great variety and offer things that aren't too easy to come by at other Green Street restaurants like quail eggs or Thai fish cakes. They also offer several pre-configured 5 dollar combos that offer lots of add-ins. Additionally if you're really bothered by eating top ramen noodles, get the #10 Fen Si Doodle- it's got bean thread noodles instead of ramen!"
27939,3,"Located on the fifth floor at the Phoencian resort, J&G Steakhouse is a dark, open, sophisticated space. If your schedule is flexible, I would recommend dining around sunset to get that extra ambiance. However, even at 8 pm (that is the time we had reservations), the twinkling lights in the distance gave an extra romantic feel.\n\nMy husband and I decided to have a date night on Friday night, and we chose J&G since it was Restaurant Week and we had been wanting to try it. As most other reviews have said, the service is incredibly lacking and is only 2 stars. Luckily the food is exceptional and pretty much makes you forget how poor the service is that you are receiving. \n\nWe both ordered the RW menu - I had the caesar salad, parmesan crusted chicken, and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The caesar salad was very fresh and for an appetizer was quite large. The chicken was the highlight for me. You get two nice sized chicken breasts (I could only eat 3/4 of one because they were so large)...the chicken was so incredibly moist. Plus the parmesan crust on the chicken gave it an upscale fried chicken feel and had a hint of saltiness to it which I loved. The chocolate cake was sinful - once you broke into the cake, there was molten chocolate inside which was complimented perfectly by the ice cream. My husband loved all of his food (tomato soup, hanger steak with fries, apple tart) and even shared the french fries that came with his steak with me (the fries were salty and delicious). With our entrees, we also ordered a side of the mashed potatoes which were amazing. They were so smooth and had just the right amount of butter in them. I only wish the side had been bigger because we argued over who got the last scoop!\n\nFor a beer, two RW menus, and a side of mashed potatoes, our bill before tip came to $79 which we thought was great. For a nice, resort steakhouse, the prices on the regular J&G menu are incredibly reasonable and we are already planning another trip back to try more items on the menu!"
22034,3,"I came here with a friend on my past trip to vegas. (Wish I could go back already) \n\nWe were walking around the Forum Shops at Caesar's and came across this place. We were distracted by the delicious looking pizza everyone was eating. After looking at their menu, we decided to give it a try. \n\nWe sat at the bar since it was just us two. We got there during happy hour and totally didn't realize how late it was.. It was about 4/5pm but it only felt like it was 1 or 2pm.. (Time difference was so hard to get used to at first) Not to mention that they weren't even crowded. It is usually crowded at places during happy hour back at home but I'm glad we didn't have to deal with crowds. \n\nAt the bar we ordered some drinks to try.. When in Rome right? Or in this case, Vegas. I got their Frozen Bellini which was like a slurpee.. it was awesome! If you know me, I don't like drinks that have a strong taste of alcohol and I like prissy drinks lol. Not to mention I don't really drink. But when you're on vacation.....\n\nWe ordered the butt load of food for two people.. Tomato Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms, Fried Calamari (a must for my friend every time we go out) and a pizza. It was all so yummy. \n\nService was great and I thought that the price was reasonable for happy hour. But then again when you're on vacation you don't really look at the price =/ \n\nHere's the link to their happy hour menu: \nhttp://www.trevi-italian.com/pdf/menus/TRVI_happ.pdf"
24583,4,The best ice cream sandwich in town and (for future reference) they deliver. What's not to like?\n\nPlenty of adventurous flavors if you're into that sort of thing and if you want the usual suspects (I'm a mint chip aficionado) you'll be pleased. I'm going to be back. A lot.
33869,4,"Vegas Computer Doctor ROCKS!  They fixed an iMac that, without a doubt, would have had to been 'junked' had it been taken to a dealer.

30645,4,"WOW!!!!!!\n\nSo glad I went here! My mother in law goes here. My husband was in NEED of a pedicure (When you start referring to the bottom of your souls looking like alligator assholes you know its time for a pedicure) Since I was dragging him to his very first pedicure I figured I would take one for the team and get one as well. \n\nThey did such a nice job! I liked how the pedicure chairs were in the back and closed off so you weren't on display to the rest of the shop. It is really nicely decorated in here. The staff is friendly enough, same language barriers as any where else. \n\nWe did the works and added the sugar scrub and also did the paraffin wax treatment, all in all with tip for two top of the line pedicures it was $100. Not to bad. \n\nI will for sure be going back! They do gels here and I really want to try those out!"

28912,1,"I've eaten at the Sahara location and been satisfied with Sammy's before.  This being my first visit to this location I expected around the same enjoyment.  Let me start by saying the service and the restaurant were both excellent.  Clean restaurant that wasn't cluttered and had a great overall ambiance.\n\nThe menu had several choices and for a woodfire pizza place certain items seemed out of place.  A lot of seafood and greek style apps.  \""Tapas\"" had a spot on the menu and consisted of things like Artichoke dip and Edamame??? Ok, not Firefly tapas for sure but still small plates... I guess.  The woodfire pizza that stuck out to me was the prosciutto.  At Settebello its my favorite so I figured I would compare.\n\nNo comparison needed, Settebello's prosciutto kills what I just ate.  The pizza wasn't terrible but it wasn't great in the same sense.  Little chunks of prosciutto and an over abundance of artichoke and green onion to mask the flavor of the prosciutto.  Also, if you look and the photo I uploaded you can tell there are way too many green onions on a couple of pieces than others.\n\nFor those movie fans out there, you all know from Casino with De Niro and Pesci \""you need an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin\"" hahaha.  Overall, just didn't stick out as a place I would ever return to for pizza and its in the freakin name of the restaurant.... come on!!!"
22810,4,Great place. Gotta have Nick as your chef. We had dinner real late and service was awesome. EveRything there is good from chicken to the lobster to the sake. You will have a great time. Just watch your wallet cause it can GET EXPENSIVE! LOL
21269,3,"The faux cobblestone floors in this bad boy are being replaced with super slippery tiles (gray and black). Upside? You can see up people's skirts in the reflection. Downside? Forget about traction when you walk in. I wore some flip flops and walked in the entrance near Sephora, nearly fell flat on my ass, and was told by the Sephora security guard that happens daily. So be careful, wear sneakers, and take a strong person with a good sense of balance along with you.\n\nLots of decent shopping with some crazy stores thrown in. A little disorienting when you're walking thru, because it's shaped in kind of a circle. I think I walked thru about 10 times trying to find the restrooms. Oh, the restrooms are nice, and have private little stalls. Good potty break area. Lots of good restaurants."
44565,1,What's the point of opening until midnight when vendors are closing left and right and others are out of specials! What are we paying for?
2054,3,"I stopped here occasionally when I'm in the mood for Mexican.   The food is good.   However the reason I go there is because The staff is always friendly.   It's like they're happy to see you.  Other than that it\""s just an okay place with good food"
42384,2,"Pros:comfortable bed, Great price 31per night, location, high energy casino, free parking. \n\nCons: dirty bathroom with leaking faucet, rooms on Fremont side very loud. AC is loud, our room was basic with no chair to sit in."
7876,1,"Over the years I have been here many times.  Typically the people watching is great, the food is reasonably good, service above average, and so on.\n\nHowever, this time it didn't cut the mustard.  A simple thing like a ketel one tonic or grey goose tonic, which is what a friend and myself ordered, terrible.  Yes, of course we have had vodka tonics before and know what they taste like.  The tonic was either flat, cheap, or something different altogether.  It would have also been nice if they had spilled a little in the glass, maybe two fingers.  There's wasn't anything.  It was diluted piss basically.  We ordered apps and waited a long time so we cancelled and closed out.  Went across to Yard House, much better.  Even the people watching was marginal - maybe the economy or have people just gotten sick of this place."
35404,3,"Came here for the first time the other day while on my lunch from work. I ordered the #8 Sparky which was really tasty and was a great size. It was much bigger then I had expected. I wish they offered kettle chips or a better variety then Lays potato chips. Also, I wish they had some homemade potato salad like a red potato salad with dill. Something more exciting than the plain, old, boring, yellow potato salad that most places carry. So instead of getting a combo I bought just the sandwich, and went across the street to QT to buy a drink and chips, which is fine.\n\nOkay I do have one pet peeve about this place.  I think it's absolutely crazy that they don't answer the phone during the lunch rush. To me, that is really poor service. Don't get me wrong, obviously by my rating I truly like this place, but to say you're not going to answer the phone because of the rush seems almost...lazy. There are PLENTY of places that have lunch rushes, and some bigger than here and they answer the phones. I almost didn't come here because I originally was told about this place from a coworker so I Googled their number and called to find out more specifically where they were located. But instead of speaking with someone I listened to a message that stated no one would answer the phone during this time. It's a good thing I found them because had I not, that alone would make me not want to try them. It's a pretty big inconvenience to customers who have never been or would like to know about the items they carry. I just don't feel a business should ignore their customers just because they're busy.\n\nEven with the above I will still come here because the sandwiches are excellent!!! And this is coming from someone who isn't a huge fan of subs or sandwiches; I think it's because I ate them so much as a kid."
14800,2,"I don't know how I feel about Prime. Sure, the location can't be beat. However, the restaurant itself is large and is not intimate or romantic. My girlfriend and I sat down at the last seating (10 pm) and there was still plenty of commotion. The decor is very old fashioned and seems outdated and like I am in my grandmothers dining room. \n\nI prefer modern decor in an intimate setting where you can enjoy conversation and not feel rushed . This is not Prime.\n\nAs every other review points out, the food is good and so is the wine list. The highlight from out meal happened to be the salmon sashimi appetizer, it topped sashimi from Nobu."
19152,3,The employees here were extremely helpful and very nice. They helped me find exactly what I was looking for and very quickly at that. I definitely recommend this Ace for anything and everything you may need.
19933,0,"The wife and I joined another couple on a Hoover Dam Tour.  Part of the tour package was lunch at the Miracle Mile Shops upon our return, along with a voucher with Whittlesea Cab to get us from the mall back to our hotel.  Sounds like a winner, right?\n\nAlas, not to be.  At the end of a VERY long day, I called the number on the voucher, and got the dispatcher.  This incredibly arrogant and rude woman proceeded to tell me that Whittlesea does NOT send out cabs to pick up customers with vouchers.  I'd have to wait at the mall until a Whittlesea Cab showed up by dropping off other customers.  BUT...if I wanted to pay, she'd be glad to send one out for us.  Given that we were seeing one cab (of ALL the cab companies) show up every five minutes, we all decided to just jump in the next cab.\n\nBased on this dispatcher, you could not PAY me to ever utilize Whittlesea Blue Cab.  I'm in Vegas for business six to eight weeks every year, and NONE of the cabs I jump into will say Whittlesea on the side, I assure you.\n\nStay away.  Stay far away."
10465,4,"What's up with all the bad reviews for this place? I adore this place...\n\nFirst off, they've remodeled and I must say it's rather lovely inside.  But more importantly, the food really is fantastic--well, if you ordered what I always get :)  \n\nI LOVE their starters.  The seared scallops (I have no idea if it's a regular item or seasonal one) are ridiculously good!  They are seared to perfection and burst with flavor.  I've also had their crabcakes, and they are divine. The portion is rather small, but the quality speaks for itself.  OH! AND THE LOBSTER BISQUE!!!  Best I've ever had...the soup itself was savory and loaded with lobster chunks.  To top it off, there's a wonderful pastry shell that tops the soup.  I'm telling you, get the Lobster bisque. You won't be disappointed.  \n\nTheir steaks are served a la carte, which get's a bit pricey.  But let it be known that these are HUGE cuts.  I had the ribeye done medium rare and it was delicious!  Perfectly seared on the outside, with a warm, red tender inside.  I couldn't be happier with it.  I don't care about the sides, as I'd rather not waste stomach space, but the garlic mashed potatoes were tasty.  \n\nNow, there is one matter that makes me tempted to knock this joint down a star---their desserts are absolutely atrocious!  I mean it! If you've read any of my other reviews, then you'll know that I'm a dessert fiend and I like my creme brulee....but boy is the creme brulee here total crap!  The dessert comes with three different types of creme brulee--choclate, traditional, and I don't even remember the third.  Man, it's gross. It's super dense and thick.  Stick a spoon down the middle, and it won't budge--it's that dense.  Aside from the rock hard texture, the taste is just off.  It's really terrible.  I can't image why they would serve such crap.  \n\nBut I'll be generous tonight and stick to the five stars.  But heed my advice--stay away from the desserts.  \n\nI do hope that they redesign their dessert menu and put some effort into it.  It's just depressing!\n\nOh, and as for the reviewer who was upset with the $150 kobe steak--I've been to plenty of places that don't list the price.  And they really don't tell you unless you ask.  Heck, I ordered swordfish at another establishment and was never quoted the price (it turned out to be a whopping $45).  Seriously...if you're going to order something that doesn't have the price listed to it, just assume it's gonna cost a truckload of money.  I do, and it serves me well. Or don't be afraid to ask.  I've seen the kobe on their menu, and the price is never listed.  In fact, I've seen this at many restaurants.  I personally, don't think that kobe is worth its price.  I'll take a ribeye or porterhouse anyday."
27090,2,"It's a Grassmarket pub of reasonable size, with a reasonable selection of beers and spirits and a reasonable decor. There are some hidden treats though: be sure to seek out the back garden on a summer's evening, or head upstairs to the quiet and reserved dining area. There's also a healthy festival pedigree - a small room even further upstairs finds itself converted into a snug and cosy performance space for comedy acts of the surreal and experimental end of the spectrum (in my experience).\n\nWell done Beehive: you're there when we need you."
6378,2,"It's been a while since I've had my eyes checked, and even when I did, it was probably either to get my drivers license or just to look in a little machine and tell them what I saw.  I don't know if I've ever had a full-blown eye exam.  That's no longer the case.\n\nSince Denise has been jumping through hoops to have her eyes checked, it meant I needed to have mine done too, so I signed up so that they could see what's happening.\n\nThe Christenbury Eye Center is very professional, and they have quite the setup - you check in, and they shuffle you from room to room, where they (presumably) do all sorts of things to determine if your eyes are working or not.  Maybe they just pretend.  I don't really know.\n\nThey seem to know what they are talking about, and they have lots of famous people on the walls who say they know what they are doing, so that must make them experts, right?\n\nYou can also get laser eye surgery here, but after giving me drops to dilate my eyes (which screwed up my eyesight for the better part of the day - go figure), they told me that my eyes were just fine.  Hopefully I don't have to go back for a while."
44699,3,Really love the vibe of this place. They make a killer Moscow Mule and always have great music playing. The prices are also really decent for this upcoming area. Lookout for their locals only red cad for drink discounts. Lastly - La Thai is right next door!
1722,4,"When it comes to food and service, Houstons is as consistent as it gets!! This Hillstone Group restaurant should teach Fox Restaurant Concepts a thing or two about this notion. \n\nAnywho.... I just wanted to let all Houstons soup fans know that they just changed the Sunday soup from Mexico City style to Mushroom Artichoke. =-0 I'm personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite. However, I love mushrooms and artichokes. This soup is two thumbs up! \n\nBon Appetite!"
34673,3,"Just flew in and our of Phoenix earlier today and this place was very nice. Lovely service - friendly, very friendly,  and prompt - food was hot and juicy! Nice Chicken Breasts and the cheese was still melted / melting when it hit the table. With a Sam Adams, well that is nice. Then off to the next plane! Thanks Roadhouse!"
20341,0,"This review is not so much for this location but the parent company, Foodmaker Inc. Headquartered in San Diego, CA. \nSeveral years ago a manager at this location presented me with a special card that had no expiration, and entitled me to free combos, or other types of food. It seemed ironic to receive this gift after a short conversation with the manager,as I'm from San Diego and have been a big fan of Jacks since they were a local San Diego chain. It's almost as if I'm being rewarded for 50 years of brand loyalty. Several months ago this card was taken from me by someone at this location, he informed that their was a mistake, and that he needed to confiscate the card. I reluctantly handed it over, not wishing to cause a problem in the restaurant. I notified Foodmaker via e-mail about this and all they did was send me a form letter back, never contacting me personally. My girlfriend experienced a problem at the A&W next door, and not only did they personally contact her, but sent her 2 \""Be Our Guest\"" cards, allowing her to have 2 free combos at any A&W store. Problem corrected in 8 days! After waiting another month, I again contacted Foodmaker asking for some sort of explanation, again the exact same form letter, with no personal contact. So thanks for nothing Foodmaker, after 50 years I'll be taking my business to A&W and In&Out."
23758,3,"Had lunch there this Sunday, and we liked the experience. I wasn't impressed by the d\u00e9cor, but didn't bother me either: as long as it's clean, I'm fine with it. I care more about the food and the service :)\nThe field greens salad was simple and nice and the bf loved the lobster bisque. We shared the vodka pasta, and even though it looked small, it was just enough food for the two of us."

We appreciate the Excellent customer service they supply and well as their flexibility when it comes to scheduling.\nthank you for the continued excellent service."
12729,3,"I've stayed at the MGM a few times now, in both standard rooms and one of their larger suites.  Never stayed in the West Wing yet.\n\nCheck in at the airport has always won out for us, it always seems completely quiet and the staff are friendly.  You can be checked, room key in hand, and hopefully negotiate that strip view room (remember to smile and be charming:) in a few short minutes.  Compare that with the actual hotel check in which can sometimes resemble a scene from World War one trench fighting.\n\nThe non West Wing rooms are pretty old now, they show their age.  Keep that in mind, and its not too bad.  CRT's in hotel rooms feel so weird now, not an LCD to be seen.  Beds are comfy, rooms are tidy but showing some fraying, scrapes and bumps around the edges.  Bathrooms are nice and spacious even in the small standard rooms, featuring some pretty decent freebie bathroom products.  The shower on our last visit was red hot, and like a firehose, huge thumbs up here :)\n\nResort fees are pretty much defacto in Vegas these days, the MGM isnt any different.  For what its worth that does include WiFi access each day, and a $15 bar credit during your stay.  I know other places that will charge you the resort fee and then another for WiFi so its not *too* bad given the status quo.\n\nThe casino itself is absolutely huge.  Walking from one end to the other takes a few minutes, and on busier evenings towards and through the weekend, it gets smoky.  They pretty much have every single which way to separate you from your wage packet, from simple penny slots through to all your favourite table games and high roller lounges, to get your cash even quicker from larger denomination fills.  Its a dark, gloomy place, which I actually like, its fun to gamble in.\n\nThe array of restaurants is fantastic.  Theres a food court with basics like Nathans and McDonalds, going through big name chefs like Tom Colichio and Michael Mina all the way up to three star Michelin awarded Joel Robuchon.  There really is something here for every budget and palate.  Theres also your standard coffee shop and buffet places, which are overpriced and mediocre to be honest.  One note is that the vast majority of the food outlets close by 10PM, which has caught us off guard on many an adventure.  Wolfgang Pucks restaurant opens way into the small hours, but its not exactly the cheapest place in the world to grab a late night burger.  A bit weird actually that theres nowhere cheap and cheerful late night.\n\nOne highlight we discovered on our recent visit was the West Wing bar and its daily 5-8pm happy hour.  At the start of the week they offer $3 Sky based cocktails, which rise to $5 towards the weekend.  But seriously where in a big Vegas hotel can you get a decent cocktail for $3, awesome!  We came back and back again.  We also found you can use the $15 resort bar credit in conjunction with the happy hour, which on sun-wed, will basically get you five sky vodka powered cocktails for free, woo! :)\n\nWe've stayed all over Vegas and the MGM is a good mid level resort, that wont break the bank, but does have those luxe options if you want them.  \n\nNow if only I could win enough on those tables to stay in their Skylofts..."
4505,0,"This place is HORRIBLE. I went in for a set of French gel nails and they looked BAD. The nails weren't painted all the way, the white lines were crooked and uneven. They chipped within the first 15 minutes. I went to another salon because I didn't want to complain and they said it would be $15 just to remove the gel. I went back and waited for the lady who did my nails (no trying to make a scene or get her in trouble) and told her I didn't want my money back and to please just take it off. At first she said no they look fine. Another girl looked at them and I asked to speak with a manager. I was told no manager would be there until tomorrow. The original lady then kept saying I am too picky and that I want to look like a model, but can't so I blame her.. (lol really?) At that point I said either have someone fix them or take them off and refund my money. The other girl finally got the manager on the phone and said they would remove them and refund my money. Then the original person began drilling so quickly that she was hitting the skin and making me bleed. I asked her to slow down and that it hurt and she's rolls her eyes and says or what are you going to call the manager? She doesn't care. She also said you can't be a model and I bet you do this all the time. I said no, I went somewhere else to get it fixed first and told you they were full of bubbles.  I asked the other girl to finished. They refunded my money and I gave the girl who finished $10. I went without my nails done and returned without my nails done. $10 to fix her mistake. NEVER AGAIN!!"
26003,4,"I stay in a lot of Fairfields, Hamptons, Courtyards...\n\nThis place checks the main 5 boxes for any business hotel:\n\n1.Clean\n2.Quiet - no stupid/ancient heaters/ACs that dont shut off or cycle every 5 minutes.\n3.Good water pressure and HW on 4th floor.\n4.Good/free wifi.\n5.Convenient/walkable to basic food options.\n\nThat's a solid 4.....but it gets the full 5 for intangibles:  Treadmill, pool, lobby carpets in good condition.  Snacks at checkin, fresh fruit (actual ripe bananas - shocking for corporate hotel hell).  Hot water for tea at 10 PM was hot.  Cable options were plentiful and TV had good HD (not fake HD) to watch the hockey game.\n\nThat's a 5 in my book."
44073,3,"Not bad for another neighborhood walking distance to us!\n\nFood is pretty decent, great wine list, service can be a hit or miss depending on the server.  Plus, they have a happy hour menu!  \n\nWill definitely be back, perhaps it's convenient?  Probably will not travel if it's a 30 minute drive!"

44679,0,"I was going to give this location another chance. I thought, at least I won't have to be given a tour this time. I believed that I understood the concept enough to have a decent lunch.. . . when what to my wondering eyes . . . darn! the sign on the door said that they were closed for 90 days!\n\n90 days while they put it all back like it was? You have got to be kidding me! Did you not learn anything????\n\nGeez . . . I could have told them that it needed some serious tweaking to make that new concept work. (Didn't they read my previous review? Or some of the others? Listen to your customers.) \n\nBut, you know, it did have some good points that I hope they carry over to the return of the original TOMATO design. Or are you just going to go back to whence you came? Did you not feel that Tomatoes needed to be updated? Isn't that why you tried something new in the first place? \n\nWe'll wait and see if you learned anything from this little (and probably expensive) experiment. Wait and see; wait and see; wait and see. . . . ."
44549,4,"First off, I would like to express how ecstatic I am that I finally have a great boba place to go to so close by instead of having to travel to Chinatown. I live on flamingo and have an extremely busy schedule, so this location is perfect for me. Above all else, the service is fast and friendly' I always get the lychee boba or lavender milk tea. I honestly think it is comparable if not better than tea station. A must try for boba lovers. ohh... did I mention they have vegan ice cream??? Bomb.com. :D"
16155,0,"Shame on International Marketplace,\nthey erase and create their own expiration\ndates on some of the food products.\nI confronted them on this, they were speechless\nwhen I removed an expiration date sticker\nshow the item was already expired!!\n\nThey also have the worse customer service I have\never seen!!!\n\nAlso beware of the filipino aisle, most snacks are expired, and they have no expiration dates!"
32380,2,"A warehouse full of whiskey -sure, sounds like fun. A few of us dropped by Whiskey Warehouse after a late dinner down the street. \n\nWe arrived around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and, while it wasn't super crowded it was starting to fill up. The music was definitely loud and they were playing all sorts of tunes, mostly rap & pop when I was there. I agree with Julia S. - the crowd was pretty frat like - but frat brothers 10 years post-college. \n\nWe were able to order drinks right away and the bartender was fairly friendly and efficient. Just as their namesake states, they have an extensive whiskey menu, and I would hope the servers are helpful in those selections, but none of us partook in those libations. They also had a decent wine selection, too. Inside, WW sports a number of big flats screens and a partial brick/industrial feel inside. \n\nI imagine if you can score a table, this would be a good spot to hang with some friends for a few hours. They also offered some fairly sweet daily drink specials - one that caught my eye is their Sunday drink special - $2 mimosas and $3 Bloody Marys. Mmmmm hmmm...can't wait until noon on Sunday!"
46058,4,"My new favorite restaurant in Phx. The food is amazing and creative, I love the focus on local product. The staff is friendly and attentive and the food comes out fast. The variety on the menu is great and I love that there are a lot of plates/sides you can share. I even had a fancy push pop for dessert. Remember those as a kid? I went with my husband and we also took my mom when she came to town. Great food, awesome atmosphere, I highly recommend it."
32361,0,"Cute, modern, pastel love-fest looking place.\n\nI requested a sample of the Carrot Cake, which was promptly handed over: white gelato, white spoon... and a black, curly hair.\n\nTruly, a Kodak moment."
27293,1,"Very disappointing. Margaritas were very good and service was fine. But the food?  Overpriced and not good. We started with the duck confit empanadas.  The filling was nice but the sauce was way too sweet and then there was the crust.  You needed a steak knife to cut the thing!  We ordered the pulled pork tacos for two dinner (32.00).  It took quite a while and when it came the tortillas were very small and extremely doughy.  The pork was fatty and just not very good.  \n\nOn top of everything else, it is very dark so it's hard to see what you are eating.  I used my iPhone flashlight app so we could read the menus.  \n\nReally wanted to like the place but the quality was not there.  Definitely would never go back.  One start is for service and the other is for the drinks.  That's it."
29786,1,"Let me explain why this place deserves no more than 3 stars:\n\nThey shout customer orders over a loud speaker like you are getting a wake-up call via the 1MC on a US Navy ship.  No, that is not a good thing!  Plus, it is crowded, packed, and very loud.\n\nPeople seem to come here for the cheap food ($5-6 per order), but you get what you pay for.  Carolina's West personnel throw bland food in a styrofoam carton and expect you to be content with some various combinations of lettuce, beans, cheese, and tortillas.  The taste is totally bland.\n\nAbuelos, which is just a couple miles to the north, is a much better option for Mexican food.  Don't say that I didn't warn you!!!"
21239,1,"So did anyone go to the last First Friday event? (It was on May 5th, 2011)\n\nThat was really, really weird. Cages all around the street festival on Casino Center, event staff members checking everyone and I saw at least 50 cops/security guards standing around. \n\nI quickly left that area (cops make me feel uncomfortable.....must be a black people thing), and a few hours later I heard rumors of cops strolling through the main event area and shutting it down. \n\n........WTF? I'm definitely going next month, but if it's like that again, sorry, but that's gonna take the fun out of it."
46158,4,"Great brunch!   Dog friendly non-smoking patio.  Really good service and excellent food.   We had the bacon beer chorizo benedict, really great.   Can't wait to come back for mimosas."
25584,3,"I was too full to eat a sandwich, which made me quite sad because I had read so many rave reviews about the Poached Egg sandwich and the Cuban. I had to limit myself to the Elixir and an almond croissant. The Elixir was light and refreshing but packed lots of flavor. It's a drink that you sip on, due to the tangy ginger. I've had many bad ginger drinks lately and am relieved that I finally found one that did it justice. The almond croissant wasn't impressive...it probably would have been better if they served it toasted. I've had much better ones in SF. Much, much better. However, I loved the ambiance here and even chatted with a stranger across the table.\n\nThe only downfall here was that 2 of the staff gave me some attitude for not knowing I had to get a table first before ordering. Some patience and a smile for an out-of-towner would have been nice."
11188,3,"The place smells wonderful.  The selection runs to mostly white flour breads and a few sweet items.  The bagels are decent--not water bagels, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere in Vegas that makes REAL bagels."
46690,2,"The food is good. Plenty of choices to choose from. So far I've tried the sangria and the house strawberry margaritas. The drinks were not spectacular. The food was delicious. The service was lacking. I'm sure they were super busy for cinco de mayo. Still, it was pretty bad. We didn't get our waters refilled. My coworker wanted a chicken and cheese quesadilla, plain. She received two little flour tortillas folded over like tacos with cheese & chicken. They were sooooo tiny and charged a regular priced meal...."
4948,0,"Be careful when you eat in this restaurant I was order ong choy it has grass in side the food they gave me an other plate the second plate it has more grass then the first plate .and the price so expensive , never again and i recommend don't go to this place ."
42057,0,"Would never eat in this restaurant again.  Lousy food and the service was worse.  Took a friend there who came in from Florida.  Our friend ordered a cup of soup before dinner and it came out in only what I can describe as something not much bigger than a thimble.  Then the waitress tells us that this is their sampler so our friend ordered a bowl of soup.  It was huge.  We laughed so hard.  The food was supposed to be Mexican.  But having spent considerable time at some of the best restaurants in Mexico, the food here would be laughable if it wasn't so bad.  No flavor, nothing.  Really not good.  And the waitress.  Talk about attitude.  Kept calling our friend \""missie\"" or \""me lady\"".  Seriously?  Let me give you a hint.  You are a waitress, not the Queen.  Being a waitress or waiter is a tough job so we go out of our way to be nice.  Not a job that I would want.  But, your job is to be nice, give good service, etc.  The wait staff here needs serious traiining.  I was watching one of the waiters put plates on the tables.  He would neatly lay out the plates and then to position, he would put his hand in the middle of the plate, palm down, to shift if around, to put it in place.  Not sure where his hand had been before placing the plates, but what a turn-off.  Hopefully he just didn't come from the bathroom, or worse.  This place is nothing more than an embarassment.  So sorry to have taken our out of town friend to this place.  If it lasts a year I would be surprised."
14859,3,"Definitely not THE best buffet in Vegas, but I chose this place specifically for its value\n\nHaving said that, this buffet is pretty damn good and has A LOT of selections. Crab Legs for days, surprisingly good Asian food (they even have Pho!), and all your other essential Vegas buffet selections (Italian, Mexican, American).\n\nThis place is also huge; that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how lazy you are. It stretches pretty far so you may have a long walk back to your table, but at least you're burning some calories at a buffet amirite? Hehe\n\nAlso I wish they had more fruit selection as they only had melons and pineapples when I went. Not a deal breaker, but it's always a good idea to fruit it up after all the meat and carbs you're going to be stuffing down.\n\nOverall though this place is good for the price. Obviously if you want the full vegas buffet experience, you might want to check out the pricier places on the strip :)\n\nHappy Eating!!"
15312,2,I didn't care for the outdoor parking.  On a sweltering summer's day I am not too keen on walking around the parking lot looking for my car then suffering 1st degree burns from the hot seat.\nIt does have some of the brands I like & they are in an A/C enclosed setting so that was a plus.  Now the food court is truly pathetic.  Talk about having to choose from Bad or really bad food.
10652,0,"Weak!  Went there with my gf on an allegedly Jello Wrestling Sunday only to find this club to have very little going on.  Two girls wrestled in the inflatable pool for about 5 minutes and then that was all for the jello wrestling.  On the website they make you believe that jello wrestling is a big deal there on Sundays and then you get there and after the five minutes of jello wrestling the club is basically dead as a doornail. During the jello wrestling, there are no other girls on stage. After the wrestling, there is 1 girl on stage and the others walking around the club soliciting dances. The club was not the Deja of yesteryear. I had been there about 4 years ago and it was crazy and much wilder, with way better looking girls. These girls were nothing to look at with faces for radio. I didnt want a lap dance from any of them. Deja was dark, dank and sad. My gf and I went there planning on lap dances and a wild time, and wound up paying the insane cover of $25 each, and left after about 45 minutes. I wouldnt recommend Deja to anyone. Try another LV club. There are def enough variety in LV."
22798,0,"Terrible experience. We arrived to this place at 2:45 on a Wednesday with a group of 7 people for a late lunch wanting a sandwich/salad. We were seated right away but from then on the service was horrendous. We waited for our drinks for 30 min before our waitress came by to take a order. Our orders were taken but then it took over ONE HOUR for our food to arrive. During this time no one came over to explain the delay or check up on us. The food arrived sporadically, so that by the time the last person's food arrived (a full HOUR AND A HALF after we arrived) the first few people were done eating. There was only two waitresses working the place, which was fine, but only one of them was actually waitressing, the other one was just standing behind the tea bar, cleaning and organizing stuff. Hello! If we are just waiting for 1.5h for stuff, at least you could come by and offer us to order drinks or something. She didn't even care! After our meal I went up to her on behalf of our group and asked to speak to the manager. She said \""the manager is in the back, is there an issue I can help you with?\"" and I explained our frustration at the lack of service and waiting forever for our food and she actually argued with me! She said \""actually, we checked the tickets and it only took half an hour from the time you ordered till the food arrived.\"" Sorry, but maybe that's because it took forever to order our food, and it was MAYBE a half hour until the first person in the group got their food, the last person didn't get theirs till 3:45pm.  And besides, why would you even argue that with me? Even half an hour is too long to wait for a SANDWICH! And why don't you just get the manager?! She went on to say that the manager was also the cook in the back, and the only one at that. Whatever, then at least let us know that before we waste forever at your place, or offer us some tea or coffee while we wait, it's not like you're THAT busy.  The one time I actually did need something (I got coffee as my drink, but there was no milk and sugar given with it) I actually waited so long that I eventually GOT UP and approached the waitress to ask her to hand it to me before I the coffee got cold. Anyway, the whole attitude was just snobby and I didn't like it. I would recommend NOT to go to this place!"
29595,1,"Yea... been here a Couple Times for LUNCH ... still ISN'T blowing my skirt up.\n\nThe Service is mediocre at best... thankfully they serve REALLY BIG glasses of soda and water so that they don't have to attend to them that often.\n\nThe Food is .... ok... nothing spectacular... but Not Horrible either.... really Middle of the Road... but in this town... that is not a good thing because there are too many other places (Yard House downstairs) that offer better fare.\n\nOrdered the Chopped Asian Salad... Note... this does not come with lettuce or mixed greens ... just chopped up asian cabbage, red cabbage, peanuts, chicken chunks, wonton strips and red onions... the menu said scallions which are fine by me... but if I knew it was red onions... I would have asked they be skipped as I don't care for red onions.  And the salad dressing... rice wine vinegar... was Too Sweet....  and sugar-y tasting for me.  Oh well... live and learn.\n\nMy mom ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders... you get 3 good size sliders that are served with a small side of slaw and french fries.  They 'looked' better than they tasted.  The pork was Dry.... the Bun was old/stale.... and the bottom bun was soggy.  The BBQ sauce was ok... \n\nThe NICE thing... is that if it's not crowded... you can sit on the patio... and that is OH SO LOVELY on a beautiful spring day."
21969,2,"Yes I finally got to try Earls! My life is complete! Not...\n\nAnyway, I thought the concept of this place was cool. They have various locations nationwide. The one in Vegas of course is open until odd hours of the day. I came here after I left Marquee and was seriously dying to try the infamous Earl of Sandwich.\n\nMy friend raved about the tomato soup but I thought I had better. The sandwich was good, but I didn't see the big deal on JUST a sandwich.i mean seriously, it's just a sandwich. I like how it's not marked up like everything else is in Vegas. Good for a late night bite but I don't think I'll crave it ever again.\n\nThanks Earl."
17555,1,"Went here for Mother's day since it was close to home and we were craving Indian.  I've had Indian food all over Vegas and this was one of the worst experiences.  I really wanted to like the place as I love to support local mom and pop establishments but this was quite disappointing.  We ordered the chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, veggie samosa and some garlic naan.  The chicken korma tasted off and was really oily.  The lamb vindaloo also did not taste like other vindaloos we've had, this tasted a little too tangy.  The garlic naan tasted like it was reheated in a microwave so it got hard and chewy once it cooled down.  The only saving grace was the vegetable samosa, which was filled with potatoes and peas and had good flavor.\n\nI wish I could say that I'd try this place again, but I think I'll just drive further and go to the Mint or India Palace for better indian food."
14764,1,"Eureka, I've got it!!! \""Ah (what a) Sin\"" to eat here! ;) \n\nOk, ok...I'm being a bit harsh. It wasn't ALL that bad, but it was not by any means ALL that great either. It was our last sushi stop on our little tour of Vegas sushi houses, and I'm glad it was! I think if I would have eaten there before; it would have turned me off to trying any others. \n\nI mean, I guess you get what you pay for...we were doing our little touristy walking the strip, taking pictures thing, and stumbled upon a beautiful glossy sign that read \""All you can eat sushi for $20\"" SCORE!!! Being that we were in Vegas, we took a gamble (see what I did there, Vegas - gambling?) ok moving on....the restaurant is pretty, the outdoor dining faces the fountains @ the Bellagio...which is always an amazing show to watch so it wasn't all that bad. The food however, left us a bit disappointed. We didn't say anything though, because our waiter was so nice and kept asking if we would like anymore. He looked quite shocked that we didn't order any rolls other then our allotted 3 at a time deal...especially since we left half of the food on our plates. The ma\u00eetre d' was also VERY helpful with telling us about some cool comedy shows to check out...he even went as far as to phone-a-friend to see if he could score us some tickets or discounts. \n\nSo overall, the food will be forgotten...but the service will forever be embedded in my memory. (Or until the Alzheimer kicks in) C+"
22842,3,"All you can eat sushi?  Oh yes!\nHawaiian style grinds?  Oh Yes!\n\nThis is a must go to place for anyone from hawaii. The AYCE sushi is fantastic, but it does have a timelimit and they are supposedly strict with leaving leftovers (we did not).\n\nAlso comes with a dessert.  \n\nYou want malasadas?  they have them here too!"
27807,2,"This is a fun place to eat, but just not my cup of tea.\n\nThe service was very good and is what gets it a passing grade.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was very average. Everything was completely over-seasoned, so much so, that i could only eat half the food, and I was starving. Do not get the special hash and the potatoes on the same plate, they are seasoned nearly identically and would require you to drink a gallon of water to even attempt to finish it all. The quality of everything else though is fairly good though and i think this is why it is popular here. Maybe just stick with waffles and pancakes, they did look pretty good.\n\nIt is hard to say that i would recommend this place, maybe i would if I knew that person loved over seasoned food. It is a fun place though."
36776,4,"Can't say anything bad about this please, and believe me I've reviewed some bad places before. I love 910 LIVE. \n\nI am a local concert photographer and shot A LOT. When I'm hired for a show at this venue I jump at the opportunity. \n\nIf you didn't know it was there, you'd probably miss it. But get off McClintock at 202 and headed a 1/4 mile north. It's on your left at the corner. The front is unassuming and mostly you'll end up going in the side door. This side door opens to the rear of the venue that is absolutely huge. It's essentially a concrete slab in the back with those hugh 10' tall shipping containers stacked on top of each other to make back walls. It's very cool. There is elevated seating all along one side where if you stand or sit you can see over the center floor crowd to the large stage. One of of this area has a bar that opens onto the back of the actual building. Beers are absolutely reasonable and they carry domestic and all local craft brews, too. Their whiskey is in line with many Tempe haunts (not the over expensive Scottsdale prices).\n\nI mentioned the stage because it's great. As a photographer I've been to some stages where the lights are so bad it is tough to even begin to shoot a show, but both the lighting and sound here are top notch. There is a large rigging that goes about 20' up behind and above the front of the stage so lighting is not an issue. The guy who runs sound here (may even own the place, he's white and bald) is an absolute perfectionist when it comes to his audio. It's always great.\n\nSometimes between bands on large shows, they do floor shows. They once had this art group of women with metals plates attached to bikinis, they danced around, and had metal grinders shoot sparks off their bodies. You are definitely in for a treat at 910 Live. \n\nI mentioned the outside stage, but there's also an inside stage. The two stages back up to one another so they can open this large garage door and move equipment between the two stages quickly. While the inside stage is much smaller, the lights are still good, and it's intimate. I've seen the inside totally packed and everyone loved the show. They just danced together as a big unit and enjoyed the show.\n\nBouncers are great and don't give me hassle when I need to move behind the rope to get side stage shots or even shots from behind the bands. They've always been accommodating and friendly, but they also run a tight ship and I've never seen anyone get unruly at this place. For the bands, they also have a \""green room\"" which is a green trailer that sits off to the side of the stage. Inside is a bank of theatre mirrors and a prep table, comfy couches and chairs, and a private bathroom with shower. Good area and good times completely at this venue."
2777,3,wonderful wonderful friendly service and breakfast. sat outside but the whole place has a comfy family atmosphere. down home cooking!
27124,3,"I went here with a friend for a catch up.  After absorbing the relaxed and bohemian atmosphere (and a good lenghty chat) we finally ordered.  We decided to order a few starters and share, as it all looked so good!  The halloumi cheese was yum, the spinach/feta pastry was ace and the humus was beautiful!  Mains was a mixed grill for each of us and I don't think I've ever eaten such soft and scrumpalicious rice! (And I've lived in Japan!)  It was a perfect complement to the meat, which was also lovely.  The staff were attentive and our meal was reasonably priced for the quality of food.  All in all, a cosy and intimate restaurant with tasty food.  Will most definitely go back when in Edinburgh."
22791,4,"Great food as always.  The owner is incredibly professional, friendly and charismatic;came buy three times to check in on experience and even asked if we wanted more antipasto salad items(on an already generous, well-priced portion.)  The service is great.  Homemade breads.  Extremely generous portions.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to all."
45276,4,"I've always been blown away here.. From the moment you walk in the staff has such a nice air about them. I've been here a few times but I forget to check in, this salon has been my go to spot for my beauty needs the second I discovered it. \n\nD'Lisa has done a Brazilian wax for me (which by the way was QUICK! not as painful as I expected, D'Lisa has an awesome personality and doesn't mind chatting while she does it), and a few eyebrow and lip waxes. After my first visit I decided I would try to have my hair cut and styled here as well, and I chose Vanessa... And I couldn't be happier! She is very sweet like everyone else. She did a great job and this last visit, we decided to make a drastic change. I had very long, thick hair. She suggested a short cut and I love it. I also had my eyebrows and lip recently waxed by Taylor as well and I was incredibly happy with those results too. I always love to come in and relax. They also offer drinks and snacks which I think is nice. Happy one year anniversary to this location!\n\nOverall extremely happy to find this gem of a business with people so kind. Everything has been spectacular!"
46203,4,"I found this place on Yelp and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was affordable. There really is just one woman running the shop, so you will need an appointment. I've found that a lot of fancy salons charge a lot to do very little, so I was so happy to get a full pedi, and massage. Call me spoiled but I'm accustomed to a massage of some sort being included in my pedi. It was clean, quiet, and Lynn was wonderful. If I'm ever in the mood for a pedi again I'll definitely come back!"
5964,3,Great spicy food. If you like spicy authentic Chinese food this place is as good as those in sf.  Try their Szechwan beef with Mala sauce...if you can take the spice
29027,0,"This used to be a long-time favorite of ours but we had a horrible experience this year. Went at 7PM on a Tuesday. There was no one in front of us in line, but the cashier kept talking on phone and would not look at us. When I motioned to other cashier on other side of desk, she turned her back to us. When we did get in (maybe 12-15 minutes later), the popular food dishes were almost empty, and the few workers behind the counters were not in a hurry to make more available despite requests. The server brought first round of drinks rapidly but no straws then disappeared for 30-40 minutes (he later said he got a party of 25 in the next seating area). Price has not gone down but the overall experience has seriously declined. Too bad because this used to be my #1 favorite place before the change in ownership and management."
31316,2,"So I recently went here with a friend of mine because they were craving IHOP, and I didn't care were we went to eat as long is it had food.\n\nI got one of there new healthy choice menu items the balsamic chicken and my friend got the club sandwich with a side salad and a side of pancakes...don't ask.\n\nThe food was surprisingly really good and the service was excellent."
37670,3,"I have visited three times now for three different purposes and I am confident that the yelptariat is correct in its average of 3.5 stars.\n\nFirst time, I came for a quick bite and meeting. It was just okay, but this was also over a year ago. Then, last spring, I came for a working lunch that the \""working\"" portion was over before the appetizers were even cleared from the table. It took forEVER to get our food. We were there for probably 2.5-3 hours in total for what should have been an hour and a half meal, tops. I had the chicken sandwich, which was seriously lacking in flavor, but huge in portion. If food is gross, who cares about how much you get, you know? \n\nThe last visit I made was with my girl Dana. We sat at the bar for happy hour and this was the best visit of them all. The drinks are truly magnificent (I had never drank here before) and on the happy hour menu, some are half-price, giving you what is truly worth the $15 for $7. \n\nWe got some appetizers--mac and cheese, oysters, and pork fries--which were all pretty decent, save for the pork fries. Some of the pork belly was the delicious, fatty, tender kind, others was tough and gross and chewy and frankly, not fit for human consumption. I evolved to have less sharp teeth than a dog for a reason and I can't gnash through that shit. \n\nI'd like to try the dinner menu sometime--the view is great, the atmosphere is too--but I think that three visits suffices. It's just okay, but it's not the best thing ever on the Strip."
23848,1,"I know, it's Vegas, so what did I expect? Frankly, a whole lot more than we got.\nFirst, I was unable to order about 2/3 of my regular sushi, they just didn't carry the usual stuff, and I was not into the she-she rolls.\nFood was REALLY SLOW to hit the table, when it did, I realized that one order of sushi was on tiny piece...and, the Toro turned out to be $96 for 6 pieces!! My friend's wife had to wait even longer for her food. Pretty sad.\nBeer was cold, that part was good, but not much beer selection either...still, Saporo is better than nothing.\nWe switched to udon with pork belly, that was ok, but no where near as good as Noodle Theory back in Oakland.\nOur waiter was nice, but the kitchen must have been sleeping.\nNo way I'd go back there, too many other decent choices in the vicinity."
49838,4,"I loved this meal so much I already want to come back for lunch tomorrow. \n\nI really appreciate the offering gluten free options for those of us with a wheat/gluten allergy. It was hard to decide which items to get, but we settled for Thai Curry Chowder, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Dragon Fries and the Pho Dip, all on gluten free bread. \n\nThe bread was thick and sturdy which held up with the huge portions of beef (Pho Dip) and ginger chicken salad in these sandwiches. The Pho was cooked a perfect medium rare, and we loved the five spice flavors with the pickled veggies. The ginger chicken salad was refreshing, loved the crunch from  the walnut, and the everything tasted fresh. \n\nThe soup was delicious, especially with the hint of coconut. Perfect to eat on a colder night. \n\nThe taro root and potato house made chips were divine. I could eat those chips all day long. We also got an order of Dragon Fries which were great, but watch out! Towards the bottom sits all the chili, but we loved it. \n\nI definitely recommend coming to this deli for lunch, dinner, whenever. Good quality food for a very good price,and a friendly staff to back it all up!"
26948,2,"Ok first off, with the demise of Soma and the fact that Green is in Tempe.....this place is a welcome sight, and I know I'll be back. The food is excellent. However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one \""Anazazi Beans\"" and a drink called the \""Medicine Man\""? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate you'd think we'd be past this. Actually, you'd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means \""ancient enemy\"" in Navajo so that term isn't used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldn't call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying.\n\nI recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last."
34895,1,"Nice, quiet rooms.  Food in the hotel is abysmal, however, and few vegan options.  To even get soy milk, I have to go to the coffee bar (though one spectacular Blue Coyote employee, Glenna, sent a colleague, Lucy, to said coffee bar for a creamer of soy milk for me this morning -- only time employees made any attempt to engage with me).  Have no idea how this place claims to earn 4 diamonds (must pay AAA for their trainings/bias) because housekeeping was hit or miss (day 1 = trash emptied and amenities replaced. That's it.  Bed unmade, towels not replaced, room not tidied.  Day 2 far better, day 3 I had a fancy diamond-shaped toilet tissue fold... is this my 3rd different housekeeper??) and employees otherwise seemed bothered by guest presence.  Banquet rooms are freezing, casino area is smoky (both to be expected, I guess).  Dinner for 7 in Orange Sky was $530 and I got to eat side dishes only (not even a vegetarian entree on the menu)."
22994,2,The bread is not warm. The half oyster plate had one empty shell so we got 5 oysters total. We ordered the bone in New York steak. I've definitely had better at lesser restaurants. The service is excellent but the food did not hit the spot.
7677,0,Over the last two years the food quality is consistently going downhill. Their happy hour selection is filled with fried carbohydrates and the wine selection is cheap. During the cooler months when you want to sit on the patio and enjoy the views it's difficult to get a seat and happy hour is not recognized. Could be a great place they need to bring their quality up
42934,2,"This spot is great had a little trouble checking in as the system went down right when we got there, the free breakfast from 6-9am made up for the lost time will be checking out all the other spots that offer free breakfast for now on now that i know they exsist"

It seats about 80 and they have enough room for about 40 additional SRO.\n\nMost of the staff are performers themselves so they are ready to assist with your equipment set up.\n\nThe acoustics are great, the atmosphere has a very funky vibe to it.\nThey have a full service bar as well."
23224,2,I have a lunch date with my mother every Saturday afternoon and we decided on CPK so we could do some shopping at TS after lunch last Saturday.. I hadn't been to CPK in forever and the only location I've ever been to is the one at Fashion Show. We arrived at 3:30 and surprisingly the place was full and there was a 15 minute wait.  \n\nThis place reminded me of Chuckie Cheese with all the kids everywhere. LOL I much prefer the atmosphere at the Fashion Show location. Everything here just seemed kind of cheap even the napkins... & I swear I remember the food tasting much better.\n\n-Mango Sangria: Reminded me of Mexican candy which I happen to like haha but there were only 3 pieces of fruit in there and I couldn't even taste any wine/alcohol.. \n-Grilled Peaches & Shrimp Salad: Loved this salad!!! Tangy dressing and fresh field greens.. Shrimp were small though. \n-Wild mushroom Pizza with chicken: This used to me my favorite pizza. I feel like there used to be more mushrooms with stronger flavors. The crust used to be perfect and kind of sweet.\n-Jambalaya Pasta: It was too spicy/peppery for me. I prefer Cheesecake Factory's version.. \n-Complimentary bread: Wasn't even warm & the butter was ice cold.  \n\nService was friendly. I just think with so many other options at TS.. California Pizza Kitchen doesn't stand out. & if I really wanted their pizza I could get it in the frozen aisle at the grocery store. \n\nHOT TIP: Go on their website for a $5 off coupon~!!!
29748,1,The concept is great and the raw foods are very good.  But it all falls down with the service.  I've experienced long waits here.
6603,3,"Alright, I was torn on this place until I decided I really liked it.  I lived right up the street and I ate here all the time.  I tried the majority of their menu and have concluded that this is great feel-good soul fuel food.  The noodles are scrumptious, the dumplings are plump, the potstickers are delicious, and sauces are wholesome, and the Korean BBQ pork is really good.  You get a lot of food on your portion, and you can carryout.  That said, the noodles can be a bit heavy, and the dishes can get a bit greasy.  Still, it all tastes really good and while I can't speak to authenticity, it certainly warms a lonely evening."
18706,2,"I like the Bookmans mini-chain, but the book selection at this store was kind of sad. There were lots of empty shelves especially in the nonfiction section. Maybe they need to move some books from their other stores -- or offer sellers more money. The North Phoenix location is way better."
39120,4,"Extremely knowledgeable baristas paired with high quality coffee result in the best cup of coffee Madison has to offer.\n\nI love the fact that they specialize in pour over coffee.  So much so that I actually hate having to drink drip anywhere else.  \n\nIn addition to the life changing brew, they offer fresh bakery from Batchhouse and small, but delicious food menu.  The Beef Brisket breakfast sandwich will melt in your mouth.\n\nIn addition to coffee and food JPH offers up craft beers, and a wine selection.  Add to that free wifi, books, board games, open mic night, a doggie friendly dish out front, and Johnson Public is the place to chill."
29815,1,"Today, I was so excited to take my family to The Local Breeze for lunch! I had been with some girlfriends a few weeks ago and loved it! So I was eager to share the joy with my husband, and his brother (along with his family). Here's the deal... between us two couples, we have 7 kids. And NEVER have we been so poorly greeted at any establishment. We are well aware that we have a lot of kids, but we are also aware of how well behaved they are so we aren't scared to take them out. However, The Local Breeze obviously frowns upon children at their establishment. This was made painfully evident when the greeter said to us, \""They need to be controlled\"" within the first 2 minutes of our arrival. So, we took our brood of offspring, and put them back in the car to support another downtown restaurant. \n\nIt's completely fine that this is not a child-friendly eatery. And to be completely honest, i might still go while on a date or otherwise child-free occurrence. The point is that there is no need to talk to customers in such a fashion to make them feel completely unwanted and uncomfortable at your restaurant. It was severely disappointing and I will be sure to spread the news as well as possible in order to save The Local Breeze the inconvenience of having to deal with such annoying little customers. *insert sarcasm here*."
10090,2,"Mediocre stay. As a kid I always wanted to stay at Circus Circus., simply because of the midway and Adventuredome. Never happened. Now as an adult my husband and I stayed INCASE we couldn't find a babysitter and had to take our son along. Luckily we did have a babysitter but unfortunately we were  stuck with the room... March Madness weekend, everything was mostly booked and overpriced.\nCheck in was at 3pm but we wanted to check in early since we arrived at 10am. Check in fee was $35., umm no thank you. So we returned around 2pm after a meal and a walk on the strip and were able to get the room by then. There was a charge of $10/per night for the resort fee. Which includes wi-fi access, fitness room, pool etc.\nStayed in the Manor Lodge which is inconvenient because of the walk., but whatever. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty big. The wi-fi was horrible! I could only get a \""decent\"" signal standing by the fridge in the corner. As soon as i walked to the bed it would disconnect. WACK! Speaking of the fridge, it was broken. We couldn't chill our drinks smh.\nOverall IF you can Avoid staying here, it's best. Especially if you have no children with you. But if there's no other option it's good just for sleeping/showering etc. Really that's all you need it for anyway, right? :)"
45543,3,"I'm impressed with the smoked wood aroma that ultimately made us turn back in our tracks to go see what this place had to offer.  You step in and immediately you're in clear view of the grill with the wonderful & tasty creations going on right before your eyes.  Staff is knowledgeable and explained the menu quite well as this was our first time here. \n\nOur order was taken promptly and we headed out to the quaint patio to choose our table as the place was quickly getting busy. They offer a delectable choice of sauces to complement the main entr\u00e9e. The garlic was by far my favorite. Although, each sauce added a certain flair to every bite of steak. We ordered a regular size order of the skirt steak- the portions were more than plenty. A side of rice,  and a roasted corn completed our meal. Presentation was great. They used wooden oblong plates that added a certain element to the dish.\n\nOur order was brought out to our table surprisingly fast.  The skirt steak was tender, juicy and seasoned just right and served with a fresh baby greens salad and a slice of buttery toast. The roasted corn was tasty. The yellow saffron rice was good. The empanadas were okay. Overall,  the food was delectable and I will be back to try the rest of the menu offerings. (I'm giving it four stars due to the fact that they didn't have a bathroom for patrons)..."
19437,2,"Ah, this place only gets 3 stars.....it would get more but...read on:\n\n1.  This is a great spot to eat after last call...packed, but damn it's good.  \n2.

That' s my biggest complaint.  It would be different if the food was amazing or it was overflowing with meat....but it's neither of those things."
48382,1,Most crowded bar I've ever been to on a Sunday. My experience there left me feeling very overwhelmed.. We started with margaritas at the Hefe on Mill and then Uber'd our way on up to the one in Old Town Scottsdale. \nI think if this bar was in a smaller city it would be more fun; just too many people for such a small spot. Or management might want to think about having a limit on how many people at one time.... It was ridiculous.
28436,0,"Sadly all of my experiences were luckluster at best. Uninformed staff, unknowledgeable staff, and poor communication.  They do not return phone calls or email messages or requests made on their website.  For brick and mortar prices one expects a superior experience.  \n\nRegrettably when I made inquiries the single time I did get a response, the staff member was, shall we say not very polite.  Roleplaying such as D&D or Pathfinder is supported reluctantly.  LSoM did not support free RPG day.  I'd suggest Empire Game Shop, it is run by gamers for gamers.  Empire is new and friendly and polite."
37630,2,"My girl friends and I kicked off our Vegas weekend with a late and light lunch at Holsteins.  I was salivating when I saw Billionaire burger ($28) on the menu with kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo, but I decided that the Hen House burger ($14) was good enough for half the price with its fried egg and bacon.  That is, until our server highly recommended the award winning Gold Standard burger ($17.50) with dry aged beef, bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli.  It was done--I would eat the winner.\n\nAlthough complex and tasty, the Gold Standard didn't make me shake my buns or roll my eyes backwards.  I didn't care for the fancy stuff like goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, or baby arugula.  For a gourmet burger, Umami Burger (multiple locations in LA and one in SF) is my gold standard and it's about 2/3 of the prices here.  I did, however, enjoy the shoestring fries at Holsteins.  They're skinny, crisp, wonderful, and plentiful.  \n\nIf you have a car in Vegas, you should make the trek to Bachi Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bachi-burger-las-vegas).  Now there's a burger joint worthy of being called the best burger in Sin City."
41428,4,"Today my wife and I were running errands and getting hungry.  As we drove down Bell Road we found Marley's and thought that we would give it a try.  I thought that it was associated with Dan Marley, not so.  It is a local family owned place.  As we walked in it was obvious that we were the only customers in the place which made it a little scary for us but the staff said that we were between the lunch and the happy hour people, it was just after 2:00 in the afternoon on a Wednesday..  Our waiter, Dillon showed us to a booth and supplied us with menus and silverware.  He brought us our drinks and was very patient as we perused the menu.  Finally we both decided to have the Guacamole Burger, mine medium and hers well done. The thing about bacon on a burger is that it must be done right, crispy without being burned and the bacon was perfect.  Great burger made with fresh ground meat, never frozen according to Dillon. The restaurant was clean from the floor to the booth.  Staff was professional and friendly and the food was great. We would not hesitate going back there and recommending this to our friends and family."
27026,2,"There comes a time when all pubs start to look like each other, and for this reason the interior of the Antiquary doesn''t differ too much from the norm; it's dungeony, (but at least it's got the excuse of being in the basement floor!) is decked out in dark polished wood and has quite friendly staff. Take into account that the general Edinburgh pub standard is pretty high, and you've got a pretty good quality place.\n\nLocation wise, it's a little bit off the beaten track, particularly for tourists, as it's in Stockbridge, so I won't be making it back there anytime soon! However, they do some good food, particularly breakfast if you'd rather eat than drink, and have some open mic nights, with folk music being the general theme."
48916,2,"Fantastic value!\n\nPortion sizes are quite generous.  Food is pretty good as well.  Decor is like a perkins/ applebees.  Service is friendly.  Not the best middle eastern restaurant I've visited but I can understand why it may be popular.  Its very \""easy\"".  Easily located, easy parking, easy menu, easy atmosphere (very kid and family friendly), and easy on the wallet.\n\nWhat I really liked about this place was that I was given the option of \""a little bit of both\"" instead of only rice or only fries as my side."
33453,4,"Awesome and trendy hotel. This hotel has all the amenities a 5 star hotel must have and more. Staff is friendly and helpful, however sometimes service took a little longer because they seem to still trying to get things together since its a fairly new hotel. Room was very nice, had a terrace, 2 TV's, refrigerator, microwave, and Japanese tub. Will stay here again in the future."
18189,1,"Wasn't the best. The food was pricey for the quality. The most annoying thing was that we wouldn't understand a word our server was saying. We constantly had to correct her because she was getting everything wrong. If they want to give their Chinese place an authentic feel, that is fine, but hire people who speak English. It made such an unpleasant lunch to have to do sign language and correct the server because of the language barrier. \n\nThe positive: The food came out very quickly."
32825,1,"Originally I wanted to give this place 3 stars, but after I thought it over, it's at best 2.5 stars.  But since there is no 1/2 star, based on the experience, I rounded it down to 2. \n\nWe had to wait for a good 15 minutes even though there were empty tables and despite I was told that we would be first on the list since I was a diamond card holder.  Their reason - to give the servers time to catch up.  Huh?\n\nWe were seated at a booth and it took awhile before our server finally came.  We ordered and then we waited, and waited, and waited!!!  Our server apologized twice for the delay of our food and took our drinks off the bill.  Even she didn't understand why the delay and said 'This is ridiculous!'.  \n\nWhen we finally got the food.  Holy Jesus!  They were HUGE!!!  Had I known how much the food was going to be, we could have shared 1 entree!\n\nI had the Sage Friend Chicken Salad with Mango Vinaigrette Dressing - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=RdfzlSuVWa3eLeZnlGumyw.  It was a WHOLE piece of friend chicken breast which didn't have much flavor at all.  I asked for some ranch dressing (all they had was cucumber ranch dressing) to dip the chicken with.  I quite like the Mango Vinaigrette Dressing but there was just so much food.  I kept eating and eating but there was still mounts of food.  I finally gave up and probably only ate 1/5 of the plate!  I think sometimes where the portion is so big, it actually ruins your appetite!\n\nMy fiance had a bacon burger - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=FcGwvwVxr1GdWl653lcnHA.  He said the patties were dry and didn't have much flavor, but fries were good.  \n\nI also ordered a lemonade ice tea that was just bad!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=IC67vw3HBWwLHf2O0wadcA Stick with regular iced.  \n\nI had a coupon (I know, I know, here I go with the coupon again) for $25, our bill was less than $27 (since the drinks were comp'ed).  I only had to pay less than $2 (exclude tips).  I gave her extra tips since she was nice enough to comp our drinks.\n\nThe only way I'd return is if I can eat free (or almost free like this).  With my own money, I'd rather go somewhere with better food!"
8565,2,"It's a decent in state university, know tons of guys coming in and out no problem. Most of them have finished three year degrees and such because it's that manageable at ASU if you're on top of your game.\n\nIf you live in state, there are so many opportunities for scholarships, it's basically a free ride if you can get into one of them. After that, it's like any other university - gotta shift through the good and bad professors through word of mouth.\n\nASU is kind of known as the party school, but the business school is pretty strong here. Given the price you're paying as a resident, ASU is not a bad choice for furthering your education."

37194,3,"Quite honestly I hate the french but always enjoyed french pastries.  This place has a decent selection, not much on ambience in the inside, but well priced and quite tasty.  Only ate pastry, not any of the other foods they had there.  The service was good, pastries were fresh and well done.  Would recommend this place to cure the craving, but didnt look like they had fresh coffee, and just a case in the corner with a few drink choices.  Someone on here bagged this place for having to big of servings, dude seriously-GIVE ME EXTRA DESSERT ANYTIME! Shoot the pastry was only $5 and seriously why would you complain about a big tasty dessert?  They will let you take it home if you cant finish it, and if you cant finish one dessert, you probably arent worthy of this site, or writting any blogs food related.  I have an idea you should go sample at costco and write about the best pigs in a blanket you had there!! Wont be back to soon, but when a napolean is calling my name, this seems like a good place to cure the craving."
37775,0,"Very disappointing! \nAfter reading the reviews of other Yelpers, we were excited to celebrate a birthday dinner. We came with high expectations. Upon arrival the decor looks dusty, the tables were sticky and the framed signs are crooked. The water came in a fancy bottle that has been refilled and room temperature. The food presentation were pretty but the food looks bad from the shredded shards of small snow crab legs to the pathetic and puny sushi rolls. The cocktail shrimp is snow white and has no taste at all. Most of the food is super salty including prime rib, leg of lamb, Korean BBQ ribs, general tso's chicken, the salmon, the cod the pasta just to name a few. The food selection is limited compared to other places that charges the same ($35) for dinner. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE and thank me later!"
30121,3,"Meal for the day.\n\nCame around 4pm and there was no line. Make sure to bring your M-life card...I forgot mine, you could get the points. \n\nThe first thing I head for was the prime rib. I loved it. Juicy, moist, tender, flavorful...it can't get any better than that. Our waiter was really awesome she was quick on clearing plates and letting us know that each person gets half a lobster. Great lobster. It was really small though but half a lobster is good for one person. The crab legs were my next pit stop. There were two kinds: snow crab legs and king crab legs. I personally liked the king crab legs because they were bigger and they were sliced in half, so we didn't have to use any tools but our fingers to take the meat out. The legs were juicy and it had a good amount of flavor. If it's too much spray some lemon it. Another great part of the buffet is dessert! So delicious. I wanted to get everything. I had the bananas foster, bread pudding, flan, and some cheesecake. Bread pudding was good but not what I expected. I truly loved the egg part of the flan but not the sauce paired with it. Why couldn't it just be a normal caramel sauce? But instead it had an orange-y flavor. They also have gelato I can't even remember what flavor I got. \n\n\nGeez what a fata$$. Whatever every bite of food from here was well worth it. I would come back for sure.\n\n\n-Give it a try. \n\n\np.s.: PACE YOURSELF!"
10248,2,"Over the years, I've attended many conferences here.....ASD, MAGIC, CES, and many more I can't count.  The convention center was originally a free standing building next to the old Sands.  When they built the Venetian and Palazzo, they built it around this old building.....the key here is 'old'.\n\nThat said, to get to the main floor from either resort it's a pretty long walk.  The easiest way to access it is via taxi or limo that drops you off at the steps....but I rarely take taxis in Vegas.\n\nThere's no free internet access, so you'll either have to pay an arm and a leg or bring your own WiFi.  Good thing I have an iPad with a cellular plan....it's worth the cost....especially since I attend so many conferences.\n\nRestrooms are old and located on the level below the main floor.  The Las Vegas Convention Center is the same way, but their restrooms are more modern and large.  Oftentimes, this place has a long line waiting to use them because of the volume of people.\n\nBecause they're trying to drive you to one of the casino properties, there's not much F&B options at the convention center.  The walk is long to get any decent food options.  Also, there's very few places to sit down and take a break from time to time....that's probably my biggest complaint about this place.  When you're on your feet for hours, you need to give show attendees places to rest.\n\nCompared to meeting space in other cities, this place rocks.  However, compared to places in Vegas...it's just OK.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%.....because I have to."
20282,3,"Very nice meal.  The lobster bisque is really TO DIE FOR!  The lobster Surf n Turf is the Business!  I also had an order of crab legs with the filet, however not as tasty as the lobster for sure!  Wonderful restaurant! Loved the lay-out and decor!"
32113,2,"Everyone else enjoyed it, so I guess I'm on my own.  It was just OK.  It went too long for my tastes, so my friend and I ditched out after an hour and change.  I think it was close to over, but we had seen enough lip syncing for a night."

At first I thought the color wasn't TOO bad, hopefully it would fade in the shower.\nThe next morning I took a shower and I couldn't help but bawl my EYES out. My hair was 4-6 different shades of blonde/orange/gold, I couldn't believe how disgusting and unprofessional my hair came out to be.\n\nAnd no, that wasn't enough. I kindly asked Belle (supposedly the owner) to check out my hair, and wow, this girl is THE most RUDE, SNOOTY 2 faced person I've ever run into my life. She never listened to me, when I politely told her what had went wrong, she rudely threw in snarky remarks, I was just completely outraged. I honestly think she hasn't graduated any further than the 5th grade.\nMe being civilized I left the salon, and went back to my old salon to fix the damage she has done.\n\nI'm telling you this right now, this salon is just pure awful. I've been to a few salons in Vegas, and I've had nothing but pleasant experiences, but this salon was THE WORST I've ever been in in my life. I'm not a picky person, but if you GREATLY damaged someone's hair and then immaturely deal with your customers, you shouldn't open a salon!\n\nNow I have to pay $200 for the stupid damage they've done!! \nShame on you Belle!!!"
15174,1,"The place is clean and one of the nicest Asian restaurants I've been to with the huge solid tables and the environment is well done.\n\nValue of food is very bad.  Tried their $27 signature rice (pineapple fried rice) and $26 mongolian beef and some $13-15 vegetable dish.  At that price (3-4x what it normally costs), you'd expect something great, but it was worse than the average chinese restaurant's food.\n\nFood came out quick, but service lacked in general.  Water was never refilled and the way the order was taken felt like a mom/pop shop restaurant.\n\nI don't recommend."
11946,2,"I would really give this 2 stars, but I'm upping it a little bit because the other people liked their burgers. So here is the good: we ordered one of their adult millkshakes (has alcohol) - the mint chocolate chip flavored one - which was AWESOME. Mint and chocolate and so drinkable with mounds of chocolate whipped cream and an oreo - what's not to like? It actually didn't taste like alcohol at all, which was good for me, but got us wondering what we were paying for.That came before all our food so I was kinda stuffed by the time I got my burger. My mom had the chicken burger on a wheat bun without additional toppings and my friend had the salmon burger with blue cheese on a sesame bun. Both said that their meats were cooked really well. \n\nI was way waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay less impressed. I had the veggie burger since I'm vegetarian, which had an awesome description but was pretty effing bland. It was made of mushrooms, brown and white rice, lentils, caramelized onions, peas, and potatoes. It tasted just faintly of lentils and the mushy texture added nothing to the experience. I had mine on ciabatta bread, which wasn't toasted enough to my liking so it was kinda too soft. We also ordered sweet potato fries which were good, but nothing special. Same with the zucchini fries, which actually seemed like every generic burger joint zucchini sticks which you can buy in a freezer section. I was SUPER excited about their deep-fried pickles, and sorely disappointed - they were pickle spears, not chips, and the beer batter was crispy but way too heavy. \n\nI don't get why people think this place is so good - must be all the toppings. But if you have to rely on toppings, anything will taste good for a price, won't it?\n\nWhen the milkshake is the best part of my meal, suffice it to say that I won't be coming back. Too bad. When you go to a top chef restaurant, you expect top chef food."
11705,1,"The brewed coffee is okay, depending on the roast. The espresso drinks are disgusting. Their \""house blend\"" used for their espresso drinks is WAYYY too roasted. Honestly, I think they scorch their coffee beans that they use for their espresso drinks. Additionally, they don't rinse the espresso spoons so each drink has burnt espresso residue.  ALSO, their chai is fucking horrible. Worst chai I think I have ever tasted in my life. I basically payed 4.75 for iced milk. Not strong at all. If I want espresso drinks, I usually go to Citizen or Grinders. \n\nTheir food is pretty pricey as well and their portion sizes are pretty small. 10 dollars for an overdressed salad? No thank you. \n\n\nOther than that, if you can over their hipster vibe and the non prescription glasses (which is fucking annoying, did you not graduate from high school???) , the atmosphere is great to crank out homework and it's the only coffee shop that's open late in Central Phoenix. \n\nI'm not old enough to drink at their bar yet, but from what I've seen, it looks pretty nice and they have a variety of alcohol. \n\nOh and the brown haired girl, I think her name is Sasha, looks pissed off all the time(she is pretty hot though) And the tall white guy, I think his name is Sammy, is pretty bi-polar. Sometimes he is nice; other times he's an asshole."
46285,0,"Excuse me, why is my grande green tea frappe that I usually get for $4.45, over $7 here? Oh cause we're in Aria. What?! This urked me so bad but they already made it since it took forever to charge my account! Go to the one right outside of here. Ridiculous."
10808,3,"I'd been to Sushi Fever many times in the past but had stopped for the last couple of years. Yesterday I had a meeting on that side of town and my friend Octavio P. and I decided to go to Sushi Fever for lunch. He has been here many times for lunch and had raved about their bento box. \n\nFirst off, it is 8.95, so already that's a good thing. You get to choose from two proteins, I chose fish tempura and yakitori and it also comes with miso soup, a spring roll, a California roll, gyoza, rice and salad. Wow, was I super impressed. Everything tasted great and the portions were decent as well. For that price you would expect lesser quality so I was stunned at how good everything was. Too bad it's on the other side of town otherwise I would be in here every week."
20601,4,"I really enjoyed my mani-pedi at A Touch of Las Vegas Day Spa. Norma took great care of me with pleasant conversation and attention to detail. Their treatment was wonderful and very relaxing. It was nice to get away from the strip for a while to really relax. The atmosphere was very nice and they seemed to treat everyone as an upscale client. When we visit again, I will definitely book a trip to A Touch of Las Vegas."
41297,0,Purchased a voucher on Living Social and was hoping to have a good experience after reading reviews and doing some research on the internet. However it was far from that. I showed up for the appointment and was told it needed to be pushed back a little bit. I waited an hour and half at the salon. He just skipped out on the appointment. Failing to provide any communication via phone or text. Very unprofessional.
26109,3,"Just when I thought poutine couldn't get any better, I tried the foie gras poutine at Au Pied de Cochon. Everything crave-worthy about poutine, plus a luscious velvety smooth but surprisingly light foie gras gravy that drips over the melting cheese and fries. Definitely the highlight of the meal for me. Mmm...\n\nBetween the meat (both standard and offal) and the wine, the rest of the meal was a bit of a blur. The pied de cochon (pig foot) was delicious, but I wasn't crazy about the veal liver. This was probably one of the heaviest meals I've ever had, but it was amazing. I would come back again and again just for the poutine alone."
21542,1,"Let me preface by saying that I almost never eat fast food. Nevertheless, I think I can list about 20 fast food places that I find superior to this one. \n\nI finally stopped in to try In-N-Out after seeing the rather large parking lot at this location permanently full and hearing the rantings and ravings from people all over the universe about the franchise. \n\nFirst, coming within about a square mile of this place will put you in a (likely life-threatening) nuclear fallout cloud of grease - so extrapolate that a bit to think about what I experienced walking into the actual door of the building. Second, I was a bit disappointed to see that they literally sell only hamburgers and fries. Why are there not a few other American fried food classics like onion rings and chicken tenders, or even a few different styles of burgers or related entrees? Third, I would say that the cheeseburger and fries that I had were pretty terrible, even as far as fast food goes. It is kind of like putting that aforementioned greasy nuclear cloud into your mouth and intestines. \n\nThis really makes me wonder why anyone marvels at In-N-Out, unless they've never had anything else. For anyone who likes In-N-Out, I would recommend perhaps a Steak 'n Shake or Culver's as a well-rounded, higher-quality, still affordable and greasy fast food place. Since this is the only In-N-Out I've been to, I can't say that there is anything particularly wrong with this location. Instead, I can confidently say that I'd choose almost any other fast food franchise over this one."

27238,3,"I've been to LBS burger before, but it was a long time ago. We decided to come back here because we had recently purchased a Groupon. We came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch around 2pm. We had to wait to be seated even though there was only about a handful of people there. We were seated in a booth and they are right when you really sink into the booths.\n\nIt took awhile for someone to come take our order, but when she came I was pretty excited to order. I decided to get the sampler plate with two beefs and a turkey since I can't eat tuna with a side of the zuchinni fries! My husband got some kind of burger with an egg on top and sweet potato fries. My burgers were a bit dry, but the highlight of the lunch was the zuchinni fries! I remember not liking the potato crisps last time, so I am really glad I went with the zuchinni. It was not over cooked and still crispy! Yummy deliciousness. I didn't try my husband's burger, but I would assume it was delicious since it was gone by the end of the meal. \n\nLunch came out to be about 35 bucks? Was it worth $35 bucks, probably not but the Groupon helped. Service was ok, lacking in the beginning but it was better at the end. I heard they have good happy hour food specials, might need to check it out one of these days."
27585,0,"I made a reservation at the Kona at City North on a Sun. night for a party of 8 to celebrate 3 birthdays and an anniversary.  When I booked the reservation, we all decided that Sun. would be great because they offer happy hour all day so we could enjoy the HH menu for our appetizers before dinner.  I confirmed with the girl who took our reservation that we would be doing HH & having dinner.  She asked where we would like to sit & I told her the dining room since there was 8 of us, 2 of which were kids.  AT THAT POINT, THE PERSON TAKING MY RESERVATION SHOULD HAVE TOLD US THAT WE CANNOT ENJOY THE  HH MENU IN THE DINING AREA....THAT WE WOULD NEED TO BE SEATED IN THE BAR IF WE WANTED ANYTHING FROM THE HH MENU!!!\n\nWell....that was not the case.  Once we arrived & were seated in the dining room, when I asked to see the HH menu to order our apps, the waiter informed us that we weren't allowed to enjoy any HH menu items in the dining room.  If we wanted to we could be moved into the bar area which was literally 15 feet away from where we were already seated.  Our waiter, Colin, was very nice & apologetic about the issue.  Eventually, the manager on duty came over & said there was \""nothing else he can do about this issue\"".....meaning we would have to get up & move our entire party with the 2 kids into the bar area that was only 15 feet away from the table we were currently at.\n\nWe ended up staying at our table in the dining room but told the manager how ridiculous that HH menu rule is, especially when we were literally the ONLY people sitting in the empty dining room the ENTIRE 2 hours we were there.  Our food was ok at best.....took forever to get one of the flatbread pizzas for my boys.  At least our waiter was very nice & apologized again for the HH menu debacle.  We told him it was not his fault & that the manager (Trevor) should have made an exception this one time due to the miscommunication of how our reservation was booked.\n\nMoral of this review.....if a restaurant manager is not willing to do the right thing for that situation, get up & leave!!!!!"
14322,1,"The calamari is fab.  My wife liked her trout dinner a lot?   My fish and chips were very average.  The reason for the two stars is that this large restaurant shares on out door rest room with Restaurant North.  It is way too small for both places and in the 10-15 times I have been there it is filthy, out o.f soap, out of drying paper and usually has paper and trash all over the floor.  After all the years these places have been open I can't  believe this still exists.\nSam Fox needs to get .on this.  It is disgusting!"
33054,0,"I'm been here numerous times and received *okay* service, but this last time it was just terrible! Typically I'm there to meet clients as Starbucks is generally a nice place to do so in a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. \nLet's start by saying my name is Morgan. Yes Morgan, a unisex name. I am a girl and have known many Morgans both male and female. I've even run across a few unscrupulous business people who question if I am really Morgan (generally for credit cards, banks), however while they sound skeptical and ask more then the typical security questions, never, and I mean never, have I been so horrified and embarrassed as I was in this Starbucks. Nor have I ever met someone quite so ignorant and rude. \nThe other day, I went into the Starbucks with clients and when I handed my card to the cashier, he asked if 'he' was with me. When I replied \""he?\"" the cashier continued to look around us (a group of females) and ask where was \""he, Morgan\"". Apparently 'he' needed to be around to show his ID. My jaw dropped! I replied that I am Morgan to which he looked at me skeptically, sighed, then brashly stated that I needed to show him my ID. \nLast I knew the appropriate way to handle this situation would have been to politely ask for my ID, not to assume (ignorantly so, mind you) that I am not the person on the card because, well, Morgan must be a male only name! More over, once he knew that I was in fact Morgan, being rude beyond that point was just uncalled for and unprofessional on so many levels. Worst yet, he never apologized, you would think for that much he would have. Nope, nothing. It certainly left a lasting imprint on my clients which had a few (mind you highly embarrassing) chuckles at my expense. \nThanks for the laugh. Guess I'll find somewhere else to waste my money."
12921,3,"Nice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\n\nI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!"
5580,4,"I love this gym, the personnel there have the best attitudes, greeting you as you come in and leave. They have a small section where you can purchase protein bars,  multivitamins, and many more options. Not only that but they have a smoothie bar that is fairly priced. Have kids? No babysitter? They have a play room which is supervised that you can bring your kids to be watched while you get your work out on. There is any type of gym equipment  you could possibly think of, so it gives you so many options on what you want to work out on. They offer classes for yoga and zumba, spin class, a boot camp class, so many different ones. There is a basketball room and a swimming pool for you to swim laps. A hot tub and a sauna is just two more awesome features this gym has. I work with a personal trainer and I've never enjoyed it more. She trained me in some work outs and showed me exactly how to use a lot of the equipment there. It's honestly not very expensive to belong to this gym either. I would recommend this place to just about anyone!"
42109,3,"Union Pig & Chicken has some of the best BBQ that I've found in Pittsburgh. The brisket is soft and falls apart with a fork, although some of the pieces can be overly fatty. Every time I've been the service has been decent, but slow. Union is also a surprsingly good place to go for lunch, The sandwiches they serve are delicious. One last note, definitely get the mac & cheese. It's that good."
26772,0,"Back to poor service.  The food was ok, not worse than before but the experience was dreadful. A coupe seated after us got their good, bill, paid, and left before we were midway through our meal. Waiter was barely around.  Yes they have large groups but all that says to me is that the management is poor and they do not know how to schedule staff.\n\nService was so bad the waiter got $0 tip.  We will not be going back here for quite some time, once again.  Shame too because they are the only place I know of that has banoffie pie."
39844,1,"This is one of those restaurant ratings that makes me question the palate of some yelpers.  I'm quite the food snob, and a bit of an amateur gourmet cook (make my own pastas/sauces/breads/ice creams), so if I eat out, the food should best my abilities in some way.  This place simply did not live up to anything near its 5 star yelp rating in any dimension other than its excellent service.  Let me say that again:  Service was excellent.  Waitstaff was very attentive, and the owner was extremely friendly as well.  5 stars for this part of the experience.\n\nNow the food.  The prices struck me as being too low for the area.  $26 for filet/$17 for homemade pasta seemed cheap to my eyes for dinner.  Turns out I was right.  I'd bet a fair amount of $$ that this place started with the best intentions and good quality ingredients, but the owner has cut prices and ingredient quality because he cannot figure out what's wrong with the restaurant given such high yelp reviews but poor customer turnout (Place was very quiet on a Saturday night at 8pm in spite of a great jazz band.).  \n\nCase in point:  my girlfriend's filet was nowhere near a USDA prime or even a choice cut.  I'd guess it was a select cut or a 'no roll' piece of meat similar to what's used at a chain steakhouse.  On top of that, the steak wasn't seasoned at all--no salt or fresh pepper.  It was dreadful.\n\nI ordered the citrus \""prawns\"" and lobster ravioli.  The prawns were clearly shrimp, and not even big shrimp:  I'd guess they were 15/20 shrimp at best; nowhere near 10/15 shrimp, and they were definitely not prawns.  Shrimp were also overcooked and flavorless and were cooked via boiling water rather than seared a la minute.  Ravioli texture was great, but filling was mediocre.  Sauce was OK, but didn't seem to be thickened via a typical method (butter or cream).  My guess is that the sauces are premade in the morning and they found butter-thickened sauces would break on them.\n\nCalamari appetizer was not seasoned, was bland, and overcooked.  Calamari were chewy and the tomato sauce served to accompany it was meh.\n\nAll in all, the relatively cheap food prices + poor quality of ingredients + shrimp masquerading as \""prawns\"" in my dish convinced me the owner probably started with very high ingredient quality and higher prices, but has lowered his price point and ingredient quality to try to spur demand.  I'm guessing he didn't do well, though, even with the best ingredients because the chef in the kitchen clearly isn't the best and doesn't know how to season food.  Nothing I ate had even a modicum of salt on it.\n\nIf the owner fired the chef and brought in someone new, raised the prices and the ingredient quality, he'd have a winning establishment.  I only hope he reads this review because it's clear he's trying his best, is a very affable fellow, and I genuinely want him to succeed."
10509,4,We had a corporate dinner party for 26 persons here.  We had the private room with open bar and ordering off the menu.  The staff was well organized and handled the big group flawlessly.  The food was hot and the presentation was excellent.  I recommend coming here for a great dinner but note this is a $$$$ restaurant.   You do get what you paid for and the food is better than Ruth Chris or Mortons.
42736,1,"What a disappointing experience!  I had the fried chicken with sweet potato waffles.  The chicken was ok but it was a weird pairing with the sweet potato flavoring of the waffles. For sides, I had macaroni and cheese and green beans.   The macaroni and cheese was only ok and the green beans tasted like they were right out of a can.   The biggest let down of the evening was the red velvet cake.   It was pink and tasted like a jello poke cake."
11823,1,"The best thing about this hotel is the location, its right between downtown and the strip.\n\nI got put in one of the older rooms, not yet renovated. It's dark and stuffy. There is no coffee maker in the room and the bathrooms are super small. During my stay the blow dryer blew and there were sparks everywhere.\n\nThe maids dont vacuum unless you ask them to, which I find a bit gross. If you try and call house keeping you'll be on hold for at least 5 minutes. The staff is a hit or miss, some friendly others not so much. \n\nThere's a handful of restaurants through out the hotel, pricier than usual. Its pretty cool to go up to the top of the tower for the view, especially at night. The hotel has some perks even a pool but I would stay somewhere else next tim"
10038,2,This is a great way to avoid the 100+ degree temps. The shops are high end but bargains can be had if you look around. The restaurants are of good quality with none any better or worse than the other.
39147,2,"Cute spot and lots of fun for the kiddos.  However, when we went out to the pumpkin patch to pick pumpkins, I saw one sitting in the field with a sticker on it from a store, complete with bar code.  I don't mind paying a little extra for locally grown pumpkins, but I am not paying $12 for a pumpkin they paid $4 for at Walmart!  I immediately put our pumpkins back.  I know they grow pumpkins there, you could see the vines, but if you sell them all, it feels wrong to me to supplement your inventory with store bought ones!"
3270,3,"One of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  The food is very good but the service is outstanding (especially the lady who often serves as the hostess - high energy, always smiling)"
31902,2,Beautiful spot for an afternoon tea. But the tea could be much better. When I asked where it was from they said Canada. Seems strange to get tea from Canada Mandarin can do better. \n\nI love the view its a great spot to have a tea and the finger sandwiches were excellent.
38830,2,"When you go in an Irish Pub, you kind of expect beer and ale with your typical Irish fare, such like Shepard's Pie and Fish N Chips.  Yup, that is what you get here.  Small place and you typically have to wait to get in.    Having said that, the Burger was decent and the Fish N Chips was great.  I got the small and it was humongous, but more important hot, crispy and tasty.  I will be coming back just for that.  It's that good."
33786,1,Way to slow!  I go here on the way daily to work and usually wait about 10-15 minutes most of the time with only a few cars.  Yesterday I was stuck for 21 minutes on the line. Unacceptable. I go to the Starbucks by my office and always wait less than 10 minutes with at least 10 plus cars in line.  If they can do it why can't this one.  You risk being late to work if you go here unless you leave 30 minutes early.
17294,3,I had a really nice waiter and the food were great! The waiter helped me choose an entree by describing what was in it. He made it sound really good and I ended up getting it. Taste magnificent!
48392,4,"Great wings, artichoke dip, and pizza. Great addition to the neighborhood as our other pizza options aren't so good. \nMy only criticism would be the cursive on their online menu. It's very difficult to read and makes me feel illiterate. Other than stirring feelings of inadequacy this will be our go to pizza spot!"
49437,2,"This place is absolutely awesome. Chocolate everywhere! Everything from Hershey's, Reese's, Twizzlers, and Jolly Ranchers. A Hershey chocolate lovers dream place. They have a wall dispenser for Hershey Kisses and Jolly Ranchers. A station to customize Hershey bar wrapping. They have a section to buy baked goods. Even a couple statutes made of chocolate. \nWith all the great things I am saying, why would I only rate this with 3 stars? It's kinda sad that 3 of the 5 dispenser of jolly ranchers upstairs are not working. And the picture sharing station is not working as well. I felt like I saw more signs saying that the machine is broken than I did seeing things that were working. Additionally, I lady working the area with all the baked goods was rude. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to be helped. I cashier was able to help me. But this other lady was being rude having attitude that she needed help because there were too many customers that needed help. I understand that you need help because you are swamped but you don't need to make a scene in front of customers. There is s better way of approaching that situation."
21531,1,"If you're here on business and in a hurry, beware!  The service is very slow.  You can choose the buffet, which is very pricey and doesn't include coffee or juice, and that's a little quicker.  They seem to be perpetually short-staffed in the morning.  I guess that Bally's figures that since this restaurant is the only game in town - or at least in the hotel - for breakfast, they don't need to make an effort to please their guests.\n\nThey are slow to seat guests.  One of the waiters is terribly rude, although the waitress on the last visit was delightful and did her best in trying circumstances. \n\nIf you stay at Bally's, you either need to get up a lot earlier than you normally would or plan to skip breakfast.\n\nThere's a coffee cart near check-in, but there's no information about it, so if you don't see it, you won't know it's there. I wish I'd known about it earlier in my stay."
36231,3,"Pros: best facilities around, very clean, saunas smell great, lots of staff, amazing relaxation rooms, cheap last minute massages, beautifully decorated in winter\n\nCons: not a lot of parking, expensive, crowded on holidays and weekends, music annoying at times\n\nOverall this is the best spa that I have been to. The place is great, clean and relaxing.  The place is best (and cheaper) on non holiday weekdays.  I usually go at night.  The lockers are free. No shampoo in showers, but there is soap. The locker rooms are small but very clean and accessible. Massages are quite expensive. I recommend not reserving one and instead trying to grab a last minute, $25/$50 for 30/60 minute, massage.  Same goes for $40 hour facials.  The massage therapists are very experienced, young, strong, and listen to your needs.  Reccomended!"
1209,1,"Having had numerous favorable experiences at Coronado Cafe in the past, we were deeply disappointed at our most recent, and regrettably probably our last visit.  The evening was off to a great start with the predictably excellent crab cakes.  While the driver scallops were equally delicious, the chimichurri-style rib-eye was barely edible.  Despite being cooked properly - medium rare - the meat had a strange after taste.  After struggling with the steak - and subsisting on two shared scallops in exchange for some steak  - not an even trade by ANY measure - we told our waiter of the disappointment, at which point he spirited away the plate.  Since I was soon to be finished with the scallops (having shared half with my dining partner with the barely edible steak).\n\nThe waiter provided some explanation behind the problem with the steak when he advised that the chimichurri included vinegar and lime - two odd ingredients for a rib-eye, which accounted for the bitter after taste.\n\nThe response of Coronado to apparently weigh the returned entree to determine the \""discount\""  was an insult as it suggested that we should have either been forced to eat alone (i.e., return the steak after the first bite) rather than enjoy our meal together.  Had they tasted the meat rather than focused on the weight perhaps they would have realized how unpleasant the meal was.\n\nAs we have ample other dining options available to us on our \""short\"" list, we will not be returning anytime soon to Coronado\nBill and Bob Phoenix"
14363,2,"Good Mexican food, but it's expensive (at least I thought so). I went there for lunch and had the lunch special ($10) and a coconut margarita ($10) which equaled $22 for lunch! The drinks were also slow to come out. So if you're a tourist, I think it's okay. But for a local, it's pricey."

4141,0,"If you're in search of food, keep driving.  \nIf you're in search of pie, drive to the Pie Hole in Phoenix.  \n\nI used to go to Rock Springs Cafe on a monthly basis with my grandparents when I was younger.  That was our thing - taking a Sunday drive and stopping by RSC on our way back home to grab food and a piece of  \""Penny's Pies\"".   Penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in Black Canyon City.  I learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners, and oh my how things have changed.  From the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food.   \n\nKeep on drivin' if you're hungry and in this neck of the woods.  J, Baby C, and I stopped by Rock Springs to get an early supper on Sunday after a day trip up north.  I told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general.  He was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper.   \n\nJ ordered the meatloaf dinner and I ordered the chicken.  Our plan was to feed Baby C off of both our plates.  Good idea in theory.  When we ordered, I stated I wanted a baked potato (which was on the menu) and the gal said that they don't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm.  Ummm...Its Sunday and a holiday weekend.  If one was going to sell a baked potato, 4pm on a Sunday would be the right time.  No where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes weren't available until after 5pm.  \n\nJ gets the soup (chowder) and I get a side salad.  You really cant screw up either of those.  J said his soup was pretty good.  \n\nOur dinner comes out a few minutes later.  We were shocked to say the least.  We both dig in and J immediately is repulsed.  His meatloaf was lukewarm, greasy, and the gravy on top was congealed.  GAG.  My chicken was more like a Cornish game hen.  See photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg.  It looked more like a drumette, you know, the kind you'd get with an order of chicken wings.  The vegetables that came with out dinners, a half ear of waterlogged field corn.  An ear of corn (a bad ear at that) hardly constitutes as \""vegetables\"".  I was thinking we'd get green beans, peas, carrots, or something.  \n\nThe waitress came by and saw J was not pleased.  So she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else. I told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie.  If he was hungry, we could get him something at the outlets in Anthem (which was where we were stopping by on our way home).  J liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie.  \n\nWhen the pie came out, he took a few bites and that was it.  He said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold, but slightly warm.  I seriously doubt this was a true \""Penny's Pie\"".  More like a bad knockoff.    \n\nThe only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill, without us having to ask or talk to a manager.  \n\nWe stopped by the general store, but the guy there didn't seem interested in helping us.  Or at least helping me.  But yet he yacked it up with J for a minute.  When I walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing J, did he acknowledge me?  Nope.  So we left.\n\nAnd we wont be returning.  If we're out for a drive, and are in need of food...we'll drive to Anthem.  \n\nAnd - If you really want a GOOD (more like AWESOME) piece of homemade pie, go to The Pie Hole in Phoenix.  :)"
10220,3,"First of all, I think the Wynn is BEAUTIFUL. It's classy, elegant and it's decorated in a way that makes it pretty but not overly done.\n\nCasino: 4.5\nRooms: 3\n\nFirst I'll do the casino area. Like I said, it's beautiful and classy and personally, I just like the dealers here better. Maybe I just got lucky but most of the dealers I had were very friendly and helpful. Usually I never gamble but my brother got me into it and I learned how to play craps and now I'm addicted! Anyway, I know this really isn't according to casinos but I liked that the dealers would help me out, explain craps to me, give me pointers, etc. Note** If you ever play craps, it's definitely more fun to play at an energetic table. Serious players = no fun = really sad and boring game.\n\nNow the review for the rooms. The rooms are nice but they aren't anything spectacular to me. There was a TV in the bathroom which was pretty sweet and two sinks (GREAT for big groups of girls since we like to hoard the bathroom mirrors) But honestly, I prefer suite rooms, especially if you're going to go with a big group. Since I came with family this time, it wasn't so bad but honestly, I'd rather stay somewhere cheaper and just walk over to the Wynn for the casino area"
34489,4,"I've visited the Slider Truck probably a dozen times or so. Each time I've gone, I've been greeted with an enthusiastic fist-bump and the intoxicating smell of freshly-cooked beef. The truck's owner (would it be unprofessional for me to call him our culinary savior?), Ric, takes great care to make each and every customer feel welcome, and he doesn't let them leave with an empty stomach.\n\nWith the food he dishes out, though, how could one even consider leaving when there's still room for more? From the more-or-less standard Pep Pep, to the sauce-laden Barbie -- from the \""safe\"" Plain Jane to the caramelized-jalape\u00f1o-spiked Pulled Porkie... Ric hasn't made me a slider yet that I haven't loved.\n\nThe Slider Truck is something I had never even dreamt of, but now that it's here I can't imagine a world without it. I'm not saying it's the only thing I care to eat anymore, but it's really nice to have a relatively-quick, inexpensive and extremely-delicious option for my lunch breaks.\n\nIt's strange -- the Slider Truck seemed to just materialize out of nowhere one day, didn't it? I saw Matt tweeting about it one day and decided to try it out, and now here we are. Maybe Ric is actually a dark wizard-chef from the future, come to advance civilization to new and tasty heights! It's one possible explanation. More likely he was just tired of all the crap being dished out, and the lack of culture and street-side camaraderie in Las Vegas, and he decided to do something about it.\n\nEither way, I respect this man and I thank him for the food truck revolution he's begun. God bless Ric and his big truck of tiny burgers.\n\n#yelplove"
45318,4,They have sweet and savory awesome crepes.  Top notch service. Need to try their shakes and boba drinks.
14609,2,"Buffets are here to just make you full, they aren't here to serve super fine dining, just there to supply you with as much food as possible.\nThe price was about 42 bux  per person for dinner, add 18% for a big party, so about 49 bux total each, damn, there better be a wide selection of good eats. \nSo I grab my plate and immediately go to the prime rib because everyone is raving about it, grab some green beans, some crab legs, head back and dig in. The prime rib was actually pretty good minus the crazy amount of salt on the sides, the green beans were pretty good but I just kept going back to the crab legs. Had to get my moneys worth from that thing. The seabass was pretty good and I forgot the other fish, but that was pretty good too. \nGrab some ice cream on the way out, some deserts were just bad, some were pretty decent.\nI didn't get to try everything because a lot of it didn't look appealing, but overall it was pretty decent, although the service seemed slow with the drinks, why these buffets don't just add a fountain drink machine is weird."
29043,2,"I used to love this casino but I think it has gone downhill.  I used to be able to get some play on the machines there before.  Now, that is not the case at all!  I no longer gamble here.   I do like the freebies they give away and the line is usually long (when it's liquor) but it moves fast.  All of the employees that I have encountered are pretty friendly.  I used to frequent the buffet but recently stopped going because the line is always a mile long no matter what time you go and service has been lacking.  And for me, I think drink service is lacking big time in the slot section.  I think I was able to get a drink once and I have gambled there many times."
6657,3,"This bar is tucked away on train tracks and not quite what is considered \""downtown.\"" But it is the definition of a hidden gem. Mostly a tiny sports bar, you can feel the history here, and you really drink it in...\n\nFood is available, and it's typical bar fare, but just link the drinks, the price is right. They have slot machines, as any classic Wisconsin bar should have. The Long Islands are good, but if the place wants a 5-star rating, they have to upgrade the televisions. Other than that, stop in for any Kohl center event and you won't be disappointed. I don't think it gouges you like any of the Regent bars on football Saturdays, either."
41830,3,Super impressed with the vegetarian options and I love that it is right next door to Gangplank! I get my lunch at Planet Sub and walk on over to the Wednesday Brownbags. Perfect!
7454,1,"This was the only course with available tee times on a Saturday morning, so my buddies and I in from out of town tried it out. \n\nThe course was in terrible shape, it was really slow, the surrounding houses were full of yelling people and barking dogs, and there was even a kid riding his bike in the middle of the 9th fairway. \n\nI gave it a generous two stars because it was pretty cheap, and I guess you get what you pay for."
27611,2,Great price with generous portions.
30495,4,"NOMNOMNOM In-N-Out Burger is always good :) Something that is on their secret menu is \""Animal Style\"". You get your burger and fries with cheese, grilled onions, and  thousand island sauce--SO GOOD!! This location was very quick and friendly :)"
27853,3,"I have never stayed at a Hyatt Place hotel before, but I will make it a regular chain from now on. on this same trip I stayed at the Hyatt Place in Nashville and both hotels were what every hotel should be. great customer service,  clean room, and a great overall experience!"
3338,4,"For the second year in a row the boyfriend and I have enjoyed a summer staycation at the Westin Kierland Resort. Even though it's only about 30 minutes from our house in Tempe the Westin Kierland makes us feel like we are away on vacation.\n\nThe resort is very large with lots of comfortable places to relax, dine or explore. The have two large pools, one is for families and includes a lazy river and the other is an adult only pool, which is what we opted for. The pool area is really pretty and kept very clean. There are a ton of chairs so you don't have to worry about getting out there early to get a seat. There are also a lot of umbrellas so you can find shade even on the sunniest of summer days.\nThey also have a pool waiter walking around making sure you have plenty of ice water or you can order drinks and food. I love being waited on at the pool!\n\nThe rooms are pretty large with their heavenly bed. They are on par with the other Westin's I have stayed at.\n\nRight next door is an outdoor shopping center that has a lot of really great places to eat as well so you'll never be at a loss for things to do or eat.\n\nI would recommend the Westin Kierland to anyone from out of town or   to anyone in town who wants an easy weekend escape."
4965,0,"Okay, so my husband wanted to go here since he'd heard of it. Big, big mistake. If could give them 0 stars I would. \n\nFirst, DO NOT take a taxi to get there. They charge you $30 per person if you do, because they have to pay off the taxi driver. So don't expect the $10 price advertised on their website. And don't forget the 2 drink minimum per person, and drinks are $15 each. \n\nSecond, it's not nearly as nice as I expected it to be. The reputation is as a high class strip club, but in reality it's very trashy. The girls were so-so, nothing special. None of them really made use of the poles. If you want a good pole dance show, try Cirque du Soleil instead. \n\nI highly, highly recommend against going there.  Definitely not the kind of place where a woman can go with her husband comfortably."
37356,4,"Unbelievably amazing. The food was phenomenal. Had a nice table outside which set the ambiance. We ordered the edamame dumplings as an appetizer - fabulous, we should have ordered two for the three of us.  The curry dish was amazing. I can't stress how tasty it was! We asked for it spicy and it def had a kick. There was a lot too so that I was able to really indulge.  The quinoa burger was ok.  We also ordered a butternut squash pizza. This had a unique flavor but we really liked it. I found the spiced apple drink to be too spiced for me but many yelpers really love it. I can't wait to eat here again."
1269,3,"Yay! Really great venue to get up close and personal to see any acts that you may like. Everything from jazz, to comedy, to hip-hop has been absolutely wonderful here. Not the classiest selection of snacks, and not the most scenic surroundings, but who cares? You are within shouting distance of the artist, that's pretty cool.\n\nThey recently dropped the fee for the parking, so yay for free parking too! All in all, a great venue."
25847,3,"This place.... \n\nLooks like a hole in the wall when you walking by and nothing big when you walk in either.\n\nBUT and i mean a BIG BUT, you order the Shawarma, potatoes with garlic sauce on'em and your in heaven.  I've had the grape leaves and they are delicious.\n\nFor a quick meal or wanting something good and consistent to eat this is a the place, because they're open late, the is great, and you know you wont be disappointed."
9821,1,"This place serves supposedly the BEST cheese steaks in Vegas. So far I tend not to agree. I had a Chicken Cheese steak with mushrooms and was sorely disappointed. The portion sizes are excellent, and it looked delicious and I couldn't wait to get it in my mouth. And once I did I found it to be fairly flavorless and very dry. When I did manage to find a little pocket of cheese, things got a bit better, but they were few and far between. Perhaps I'll give them another shot someday, but for now my quest for the best Chicken Cheese steak in Vegas continues...."
8855,2,"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW!!\n\nI went with Camille H and Elaine B for our last Tuesday Happy Hour of the year at Caffe Boa.\n\nThe bar area is pretty dinky, and the student/20-somethings were kind of snooty about giving up backpack covered seats for our butts, but we managed to find some seats. This restaurant is very pretty - beautiful lights and high ceilings - my kind of spot, except for the pretentious peeps. \n\nBeing a HUGE fan of the Chef Payton when he was at Digestif, I was so excited to try this place! As Camille mentioned, the mussels were so so yummy - I would come back again just to eat that dish. But the pulled mozzerella was a huge disappointment. I really hope the \""old school\"" is up to par next time.\n\nYOU MUST TRY THE RED DELICIOUS COCKTAIL! It was so so so so good! This cocktail includes vodka, apple juice and apple foam with an apple slice for garnish. The foam tastes like caramel apples and the apple cocktail is like drinking freshly juiced apples - I've never had anything like this before!\n\nI really wanted to give this place a higher \""happy hour\"" rating, but I cannot. The drinks were delish, but pretty expensive ($10 each). The pretentious peeps kind of ruined the mood for me (people who think they are out of this world make you wish they were!), and the pulled mozzarella did not live up to my expectations.\n\nAbout KIDS: This is NOT somewhere I would ever bring my five year old. The food and drinks came out too slow - it would be a torture for a kid."
35811,1,"I've heard rave reviews about this place from my friends but thinking about it now it's probably because they were DRUNK while eating it!  Waited 20 minutes to get our food (and we were the only ones in line) then after we ordered a friend of the truck owners got there ordered and got her food first!  No good...  after the 20 minute wait we thought the food was going to be worth the wait but NOOOO!!! Our burgers were raw!  Not rare, just bloody and gross.  Never going there again!"
20823,2,"This was my first trip to las vegas, and Planet Hollywood had the best to offer in our price range.  The hotel was nice, but could have used a much easier access from the parking garage to the hotel (long walk!).  Also, when we first arrived in our room, it hadn't even been cleaned!  It was after 7pm, and it was still dirty!  After trudging back down to the front desk, they offered us the same room with a slightly better view as compensation.\n\nThe next morning the fire alarms went off from about  8:00-8:30 in the morning, and totally spoiled our breakfast.  I later threw up due in part to the migraine I got from the fire alarms.\n\nBesides those few things, everything else was pretty good.  I wouldn't mind staying here again, if I ever decide to venture back to Vegas."
3808,4,"Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!"
38432,3,"So before going here all I heard about was how trashy this was and how everyone was bitchy. In short, I did not see this on the Saturday night that I went.\n\nIt was like any other country bar - mostly country plays and then they mix in some hip-hop/top40 for us that don't know how to country dance. Psht  - I really need to learn how to country dance!\n\nCheap beers. Until 11pm it was 0.50/drink. Yikes, that is cheap!"

49965,2,"This spot was tough. We walked in and were told by the hostess we could wait 45 min and grab a drink by the bar, but not specific seats. As we walked to find a set, a server sat us in the forbidden seats. We were confused, but obliged, and then were ejected from the seats moments later by the hostess again. Working out the kinks.\n\nThe food was okay. Lobster grilled cheese tasted like a really expensive grilled cheese. Cobb salad was uninspired. \n\nHonestly, our experience was more 2 star than 3, but I feel bad since they are new and still getting their feet wet. Not sure we'll be back, but hopefully theyll get things together."
25304,3,"Went with five people for dinner, and have gone several times before for drinks and a light meal. Meat pie was great; good local fare.  Good place to get a pitcher of hard cider, sit outside, and people-watch. Atmosphere - bistro - very charming. Service quick and cheerful."
22359,2,"How I have not written a review for the Palazzo as many times as I have stayed here I don't know. I guess what happens in Vegas really stays in Vegas! Anyway, it is a great hotel, great location, the rooms are a good size and split between a sleeping and living room type areas. What I can't stand and why I don't stay here anymore is the bathroom lighting. It is so dim and so bad you can't do your makeup at all. It totally sucks."
40626,0,"Very poor service!! When we went, it wasn't even crowned but still service was super slow. There was one guy \""Mohsin\"" running around.. Said okra & eggplant are same things.. Then got two cups of same dish when we had ordered two different dishes. Then didn't get 3rd dish & said \""sorry, aunty left\"" :(... We were left hungry on a friends bday :(.. Apparently the chef sneaked out... Food quality was good but overall terrible experience !"

Their injera had a doughy texture and was amazing and I really recommend the Lalibela Exclusive if you're coming with a group or with the family. You can even also add other entrees with it and I really recommend their shiro wat too. Price was also reasonable and you will leave stuffed and satisfied!! Lalibela won't disappoint you! Great Ethiopian restaurant overall!!"
8473,0,"Well, This review is based on the sushi alone --- so 1 star. If I was reviewing the bar - 5 stars!\n\nAnyway --- If you actually enjoy RA Sushi, I wonder if you're only eating Vegas Rolls and potsickers. I know your type: New to sushi, want to get drunk with your friends and pretend to actually enjoy raw fish. I know, I know...you're in college and it's Mill Ave. \n\nI am fine to get trashed here, I LOVE their bartenders and inventive drinks...but the food is nast. \n\nThat's RA in a nutshell."
46899,1,"This place replaced a great little sandwich shop in an office complex.  I wish the other place could come back!  One morning I ordered a bagel (untoasted) and it was somehow moist and chewy.  No more Empire bagels for me!  I've gotten coffee there a few times, and both times they had their flavored coffee and regular coffee carafes mixed up so that if you wanted regular coffee you ended up with flavored coffee and vice versa.  I had a takeout salad from there for lunch one day when my employer ordered in lunch for us.  The salad was big and tasty, but I'm sensitive to preservatives and ended up with a raging headache by the end of the day.  I thought the chicken in my salad tasted a little salty as I ate it, so maybe it was the salad that gave me a headache, or maybe it was other things.  Either way, I'll bring my lunch next time if my employer wants to order from them again for convenience.  Now I walk across the street to Bruegger's Bagels if I want a quick sandwich or salad.  They have much better food and prices."
16164,1,"We went here instead of waiting out a table at True Foods.  I typically do not eat Chinese food - I'm more of a fan of Japanese or Thai.  I went here with family - who seemed happy with their lunches.  I ordered the Eggplant dish (one of the few vegetarian options).  It was ok - the sauce was very thick and salty - not really to my taste.  It was OK, but definitely not something I would want to try again.  I'd recommend sticking out the wait at True Foods or another restaurant in the area."
21713,0,We booked a room at the Luxor and they gave us free tickets to attend the club. This nightclub is whack and probably one of the worse clubs in Vegas.\n\nThe layout of the club is like a hallway and there are people shoved together in it. It's uncomfortable and totally cramped feeling.\n\nWas not a fun experience and will never go back there again.

Steak tasted like it could've came from a can (not that it did bit could've lol). \n\nPaid $1.25 for a little teeny thing of sour cream (takeout order). $21 total for 2 steak burritos,  fries and sour cream. Had I known before we got back home I definitely would not have put that on my tab. \n\nFries we're greasy...they looked burnt but didn't taste like it. My friend with the chicken burrito enjoyed it. All meals came with chips and another teeny thing of Pico de Gallo. I was so hungry I ate half of the burritto and then stopped....it was pretty bad. Granted we got there a half hour before they closed but that shouldn't be an excuse :("

49576,1,"So I rate bars/restaurants/ on a few different things. Obviously, food is a pretty important element of a restaurant. However; the place itself seemed very cool to hang out..if you don't want to eat. :) They have oversized Jenga like you've seen at Dos Gringos, they have corn-hole, lots of seating, lots of TVs and indoor and outdoor areas. The wait staff was somewhat efficient but not friendly. I asked for a water and never got it. (I assume because that was not a paid drink) The guys in the kitchen looked dirty and unkept with long hair all over the place, piercings, and no form of uniform to tell them from the patrons. The women behind the bar were so scantilly clad that I felt more like I was in a gentleman's club than at a restaurant. If I had gone there with my son to eat, we probably would have had to leave because of all the ass cleavage and toe being flaunted. Gross. The food, steak and chicken kabobs, white rice, and mashed potatoes was so bland and void of seasoning if I wasn't starving, I would have left it. The \""appetizers\"" of chips and guac were stale, the pigs in a blanket were a little beneath my expectations and something I think I could have made at home. Oh well, not many places in that area stand the test of time and I predict this one will probably be gone soon too. There was one guy, I think the GM, that was very helpful with the TVs and spent time trying to find the game we wanted to watch. He was awesome. Everyone else kind of seemed like they didn't want to be working."
45231,4,"Jackie did an absolutely Amazing job on my maternity photos!

42176,0,"We used to order from them all the time but then we quit because of customer service. So we decided a few years later to try again. Well we were welcomed back to the same old bad customer service. Let me explain, we ordered an order of the chicken fingers special meal deal and pizza. When the order was delivered we got pizza and a order of chicken fingers and fries (which is only 5 or 6 fingers and small portion of fries). After being told it would only be 30 to 40 minute delivery the order did not arrive until well over an hour. When order arrived it was Not even close to what was ordered over phone. We called to complain and the person on the other end of the phone understood our frustration or so I thought. He sent our new delivery out and it got here about 35 to 40 minutes later. I was giving the driver 15 dollars more to cover the difference but was told that it wasn't enough. So I called tropicana pizza and talked to them and the person on the other end of the phone would not give an inch or listen to me. They were way late and had order wrong in the first place but yet he would not help out the customer whatsoever. I do not recommend this place as they have gone horribly down hill since the old tropicana pizza. What a joke they have become!!"
25005,0,We just ordered take-out because this restaurant is close to where we live. We ordered chicken tenders as well as chips and salsa. Three tenders came with the appetizer and the chips and salsa had barely any salsa as well\nas chips. The tenders are paper thin and cost 10 bucks and only come with 3 tenders! There were barely any chips and barely any salsa...yet these were 6 bucks! We will never eat here again as there are other places even closer in Lake Las Vegas that are actually a bargain and you\nget your moneys worth! Very disappointed!

LETS JUST SAY EVERYTHING WAS DELISH!!!\n\na month later i was back in vegas, and guess where i took my friends...YOU GUESSED IT!\n\nto the massage parlor!!! jk...

42631,0,"I can't believe how the people can rate this place so high.\n\nFirst.  Just past year, this location used to be a burger joint.  Every year for the past 6 to 7 years, they had to change restaurants due to poor business.  Decor of this steakhouse hasn't changed from when they ysed to be a burger joint.  If you are looking for a classy steakhouse atmosphere, this isn't it.\n\nSecond.  This is considered a high end steakhouse.  Most of the upscale steakhouse with-in strip uses prime cut.  Here, they use choice cust and charges for prime price.  We had center cut New York steak and Bone0in Ribeye for dinner.  It was the worst.  They were both so fatty.  Half of the 20oz steak was that of FAT.  For New York steak, there were multiple veins going through surrounded by layers of fat.  Based on this, we probably could have a better steak from Outback steakhouse for the 1/3 of the price of this place.\n\nThird.  They were playing a music in the steakhouse.  They seems to be using the same sound track as the casino.  80's pop.Who ever heard of music being played at a steakhouse.\n\nFourth.  Sae cheap furniture that was used when it was the burger joint.\n\nIf you are looking for a good steakhouse, I would not recommend this place.  There are a lot better place for good steaks than gere.  You can go to Primes at Bellagui, Old Homestead at Caesars, even the Sterling Steak house at Bally's was better this crap they call steak at Center Cut Steakhouse.  And Ruth Chris just opened up at Harrahs.  Go everywhere else but here.  I am sure, like all the other restauarnat that went out of business at this location, this steakhouse will follow very soon."
12538,2,"Not my favorite Cirque du Soleil... First, the seats that we had (on the side), although at the third row, didn't allow us to see the performance as a whole.

So I was telling about this place called Burger dogs I seen on my way home from work. We decide to try it out only because I noticed they had reasonable prices. We pull up @ exactly 7:49pm. So were looking @ the menu and all of a sudden, out of nowhere without us even placing our order, some stoner sounded dude says \""Sorry, burger dogs is closed, we close at 8 now\"". Me and my girl looked at each other in complete confusing as I backed out of the drive thru and drove away. Horrible service and wont be back to try the food.\n\nNote: As we pulled off, we noticed three dudes inside congregating amongst each other as if the weren't at work. Im still confused."
40016,4,"Came to this location for the first time this afternoon.\n I was impressed ,nice red,white, and black decor.\nFood was about $20.94 ,for 2 Burgers, one fry and one drink.\nWe ate it there,but outside. It was a beautiful day, so good to sit outside.\nThey even provide Peanuts on the table so while you are waiting for your food to be cooked you can enjoy cracking peanuts and eating them.\n Bathrooms were nice and clean, as I went to wash my hands before I ate.\nPlace was clean, even outside.\n\nFood was fantastic!  the bun should be toasted it would not fall apart so easily.\nFree refills on drinks. Their drink machine is very different in looks, but works great!\nFries were fantastic, we were going to get 2 but, the girl working said one was enough for 2 people. It was the regular size and it was enough for 2.\n\nWe enjoyed it and will go back again for sure."
2353,4,"I had the lunch special. My service was excellent and both the half tuna melt, which my server recommended, and the green salad were delicious, far exceeding my expectations for a bar and grill. The house-made blue cheese dressing was also great. Plus it was cheap at $6.95. They also had free Wi-Fi and some craft beers on tap."
34291,2,Best choices for gluten free and dairy free at whole foods  but this location doesn't have as much in hot/cold bar options and isn't as nicely organized as others in town.  Half of the bulk buys were out of stock in both my trips. Will continue to go but to the other locations in town.
36957,0,"This place is awful.  It's always totally empty, and for good reason.  I went for lunch today since it's walking distance from my workplace, but I will never go back.\n\nI got yelled at for asking questions about the menu, it took forever to get my food, the food wasn't that good--and then it made me feel sick all afternoon.  I got the lunch special with vegetables and tofu, steamed rice, and hot and sour soup.  It was all bland--amazing, since this restaurant is one of the few Chinese places that still uses MSG.\n\nIt looks like they used to do a buffet, but now the food tubs on the buffets are filled with old magazines and trash.  Not even kidding...I don't usually write entirely bad reviews, but I can't think of a single good thing about Yen's.\n\nIf it were the zombie apocalypse and I were locked in this restaurant, I still wouldn't eat the food.  Gross."
35979,0,"Wir warteten gestern 45 min bis jemand die Bestellung aufnahm. In der Zeit kamen auf unser Winken vier Mitarbeiter an den Tisch, die uns alle erkl\u00e4rten, dass es nicht ihr Bereich sei. Beim Bezahlen ging es auch ewig. Ganz klar gibt es am gleichen Ort L\u00e4den mit besserem Service."
42876,3,"On the 50th floor with amazing views of the whole city ! I've been here once before but appreciated it much more this time, the ride up in the open elevator was great. Greeted by our hostess we were seated at the window with a great view just at sunset as we we're eating before the show. We made reservations on the open table app and it was super easy. \n\nI ordered a nice Malbec and my sister a Merlot. Our waiter was very helpful and informative about the menu. Good size restaurant, with a nice size bar and a very good wine list. \n\nI had 1/2 dozen oysters and they were on the small side but very nice. (My apologies can not remember where they were from). Came with horseradish, lemon and seafood sauce. Not the toppings I would have preferred, however it was very tasty, and 10 out of 10 on that choice, My sister ordered the onion soup. It was very cheesy, lots of onions and was made with a nice beef broth, also delicious. There were about 10 appetizers on the menu and it was a tough call which to order, they all sounded great. \n\nBread basket of LOTS of assorted warm rolls arrived with a great deal of butter arrived at the table and I hate to admit it, but I tried a couple - yummy, they were good! \n\nGreat menu selection and it was hard to choose, but for my entree I had a 8 oz filet with a side of creamed spinach, it was rare, just the way I ordered it and it melted in your mouth it was soooooo good. My sister ordered the \""Trio\""; steak, lobster and prawns. The steak was a nice 4oz, the lobster was a nice size, but the \""prawns\"" looked like shrimp....they were certainly on the small side, she received two and I was lucky enough to get one. Very delicious and buttery tasting, even though they were on the small side.  It came with potato and vegetables and they were kind enough to eliminate the potato and add some more vegetables. \n\nFor dessert sis had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and said it was just great, I did manage to get my spoon in there and taste it, and yummy was that good! \n\nWe received our discount using total rewards which was outstanding, and my great sister picked up the tab! It is a very pricy menu and the majority of entrees come a la carte. \n\nAll in all, service was great, food just wonderful and view from the top was stellar!!!! Even got to hop out on to the patio and it was really nice, small breeze and perfect for some photos of the city."
44293,1,I found the food to be a little on the greasy side. For whatever reason the skin of my chicken was coming off and it just was odd. For the price you could do better. Actually I've been to plenty of cheaper place with much better AUTHENTIC prepared Asian-Fusion.
39960,1,"Ok, I do not see what all the hoopla is about.  The burger was better than fast food but inferior to Smash or Five Guys.  I was not impressed at all. Went during a normal lunch hour and service was average. Not bad, just normal.\n\nAgain, not a fan of this place, hard to understand what the deal is with this one."
19183,2,"OK, so I moved to the neighborhood recently and finally found the time/energy/will power to go to the gym.  I used to frequent the 48th St/Chandler Blvd location and am now wishing I still could.  A couple points:\n\n1. There is no towel service.  What gym doesn't have towel service?  I had to drive back home to get one so the person behind me didn't have to bathe in my grossness.\n\n3. They close at 10pm.  This is way too early.  11pm I could understand, but a gym should really be open until midnight.  Not only that, but when the lights suddenly went out in the middle of our basketball game, we kept playing because nobody came to tell us to leave.  I only found out the hours after I checked the website at home.  Weird!\n\nOther than that, it's a gym.  You lift heavy things and run in place.  You wait for a machine.  You feel good about yourself when you go, but you don't go that often.  Fortunately, you don't have a contract."
35116,1,"There is a certain amount of novelty to being cycled around town on a pedicab.  It offers a rustic outlook to travel around town, but unfortunately it's unbelievably expensive.  When I hear how much people have paid for these pedicabs, I'm surprised that they even have that amount of money on them in the first place.\n\nPrice aside, and it's a big thing to put aside, they are in abundance in tourist spots and around clubs and for those who've had a bit too much to drink and unable to get in a real taxi might find them of use.  This only leaves the last concern which is speed and these are very slow hence why it ends up costing so much.\n\nDespite all this I do have a degree of admiration for the drivers - it's not the easiest work especially in the hilly areas."
29960,3,"I do not agree at all with the reviews that say that this show lacked talent.  I found many of the dancers, shockingly spectacular and beautiful.  And the music was great... only the a-sexual could watch that horse saddle act to Ginuwine's, \""Pony\"" in boredom.  \n\nNo, Holly isn't in every single act, but I found myself not missing her.  She was just an extra treat every once in awhile. And no maybe she isn't the most talented dancer or singer.  Even on The Girls Next Door, Holly's talents seemed to lie in having an eye for beautiful women and running the business end of things... it seems that in that that has translated well for her into this new endeavor.  I also felt that her personality was strongly reflected in her role.  Peep is sweet, down to earth and very sexual when she turns it on.  And let's be honest,  we were all there to see her boobs.   I felt the Holly boob level was more than fair and I also feel I had a genuine \""Holly experience,\"" at least as we know her from TV.  \n\nI am glad we didn't pay for the super expensive seats, but the mid-level was perfect.  Not only, would I recommend this show, I may even consider seeing it again.  I feel like I went in expecting to be a little disappointed and ripped off, having paid for her name and not a show... but we both agreed, Peepshow was some of the best money spent and entertainment had on this trip!"
47373,4,I love that this salon provides a shuttle! It's very clean and friendly. The amount of colors to chose from is quite impressive! I got a gel polish for the first time and love the way my nails look and feel. Mani/pedi took exactly 1 hour and my toes and finger nails look great! This is officially where I'll b going to get my nails done when in Vegas!
1394,4,"Phoenix's best bar!  Everyone is welcome. Bored with the usual, join the interesting set at C7. Friday night's drag show starts about 10:30 and Daveena Ross is an elegant hostess. Bring $1s to help them fund college or make-up. If you like clones, stay away. If you like humanity, come on down!"
14114,0,"this place does not deserve any stars at all. My boyfriend and I were looking for a breakfast place and we ran into this one. We thought \""how can you really screw up breakfast?\"" LAGO DID!!\n\nWe went for brunch, i think we JUST missed breakfast and I think it was 10am when we came. We paid about $26 per person and that was $26 down the drain for each of us.\n\nThe scrambled eggs looked so runny (egg beaters not even real eggs) and the hash browns tasted powdery...(it was probably instant). LIke everyone else says, there was not much to choose from. The beef i had was SO salty, at least it wasn't dry. The oatmeal was okay.  I had salad and I felt i could make a better salad at home. There wasn't many toppings or dressings to choose from. The best thing there was probably the fruit. Nothing really looked that appetizing so I didn't eat too much. \n\nWe were both really disappointed with this buffet, especially with it being in such a nice hotel, you'd think it would be better! It was so bad that i forgot I was even in a nice hotel, I thought i was in some dinky hotel.\n\nListen to me and everyone else, STAY AWAY from this buffet."
17539,2,"Delicious food, but I must've been missing something about this place. It was okay, and I didn't mind the noise coming from being in the middle of the casino. We were seated promptly despite not having a reservation during the lunch hour. The menu is small (one page worth of food) but varied. I ended up getting the prime steak panini and potato salad. Great mix of flavors with the panini and barbeque sauce dip (with a hint of horseradish). The potato salad was probably one of the best I've had...it wasn't too sour and had just enough mayonnaise to keep it rich. \n\nUnfortunately what brought this rating down for me was the service. Slow service. It took a while to get our check, and even longer to get back my credit card. I think I only saw the server once after my food came."
752,0,"Terrible. Ugly d\u00e9cor, bad food, poor service."
38254,2,"If you are looking for that cozy coffee house where you can shmooze with friends for hours, while drinking terrific coffee and eating mouth watering pastries, this is not you place.\n\nTo me, the acid test (pun intended!) for a coffee house is how good the coffee is.   I mean the unadulterated, drip coffee -- you know, the real thing.    Royal passed this test!   The coffee is hand brewed.    The blend has a touch of espresso that gives it a European flair.    In short, the coffee is really good.   So the \""drinking terrific coffee\"" part is there.\n\nBut the array of noshes is limited to 3 choices.   A cupcake.   A muffin.   A scone.   In contrast to the above mentioned hand brewed coffee, the muffin I tried tasted processed.   And not fresh at all.   \n\nThe space isn't comfy-cozy.   So you may not want to sit for hours, sipping, reading, and shmoozing.\n\nBut if all you want is a great cup of freshly brewed coffee, perhaps To-Go, then Royal At the Biltmore is your place."
6874,1,"Food is good, service is terrible, the staff didn't come to our table for over 10 min finally when they arrived they wanted our whole order.  Didn't ask if we wanted drinks at all. We were then never spoken to during our meal except to see if they could take our sauces away.  Dirty dishes were left on our table thru the meal. Staff was more interested in filling sauces, and condiments then giving service to the customers.  You can the best Food but if service is bad you will continue to lose customer like us who used to come frequently."
15463,3,"3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. Partially because, lets get real, there are limited dim sum options here in Las Vegas. I was introduced to dim sum when I lived in the Bay area, so my standards are a little higher than your average bear.\n\nCame in for an early dinner at about 6PM.\nLove how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.\n\nWe got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).\n\nMade the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were \""coming right out\"" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.\n\nWe spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings."
49011,1,"I really wanted to like this place since it's in our neighborhood, but we've now been there for both brunch & dinner and were disappointed both times. The atmosphere is so cute and the patio set up is great. However the food is terrible. We were with a party of 5 for dinner, and all of us thought our food was just blah. Then my husband & I went for brunch, and both did not like our meals then either. I hope they improve their food! I really want to like this place."
41364,1,"Great selection and the prices are cheaper here than Michael's I've noticed.\n\nBut why do I have to wait an eternity to check out of here everytime???\n\nThe last time I went there was only one register open and the cashier was just taking his sweet time, no sense of urgency, and didn't call anyone up to assist. There were like 10 people waiting I kid you not and people were quickly losing patience. Finally the poor old woman behind me walked off to find a manager and 3 more cashiers arrived lickety split after she complained.\n\nCustomer service and management needs major work but I like the store that aside."
7408,4,"Chris knows his stuff, is friendly, comes to you, and offers great prices. Oh and he obviously has a great first name.\n\nThe Bike Doctor came within 24 hours of our call. He got my ~30 year old Huffy and my wife's ~25 year old bike up and running. The had been sitting in a hot, Phoenix garage through 10 summers with no use, and no maintenance. They were purchased at a garage sale before that in Michigan before coming here.\n\nAnd now they run great. Chris replaced our seats with something far more comfortable and told us about the bikes. And all told the price was lower than bike shops that we would've had to travel to.\n\nHe accepts Paypal, cash and check. If you need to use plastic, have a paypal account ready. If you need a tuneup, seriously. Call this guy!"
29596,2,"The food is really good, especially the bbq roll appetizer.  I would have given them at least 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that I felt like I was being recruited into a cult during my dining experience. It was creepy. I researched the place and it is associated with supreme master ching hai organization and on every shelf there is literature about it, and the tv is droning on with the station that the cult broadcasts from.  I really don't like when businesses mix religion with their product, I think it's really annoying and offensive. I don't mind a message promoting the reasons vegetarianism is healthful and compassionate toward life, but the cult thing is a bit much. I liked the food well enough to go back, but I won't go back because of the weird vibe. That's a shame."
49095,4,Just used a groupon for date night and man are we going back! Service was outstanding. Food was amazing and drinks were sooooooo good! Highly recommend the brauts and the beer flight!
42874,3,"I received some dining credits from Hilton & noted that VooDoo was on the list.  Since we hadn't been to the Rio in a while we decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised that this restaurant is on the 50th floor of the hotel & had an amazing panoramic view over the strip & beyond.  I was traveling with friends & we had no reservation, but on a Monday night the restaurant was quiet - we were seated immediately.  Service was provided by Tony who was excellent - attentive, knowledgable, and helpful in offering suggestions.  We picked steak tartare and lobster bisque for appetizers - the tartare rivaled any I have had in France and the bisque was amazing.  For an entree I had the lamb chops and my friends had the scallops - while awaiting dinner Tony offered us to take wine & go out on the deck to see the cityscape; the view was great!  A member of the waitstaff came to get us when dinner was ready.  Dessert was chocolate cake for me - amazingly good as well!  Service was exceptional; food was excellent; there is a night club upstairs & it started to flow into our dinner experience, so a minor ding for that, but overall would recommend and will likely come back."
20363,0,"Probably the worst chipotle location I have ever been to. I'm a big fan of chipotle don't get me wrong but this location is awful.\n\nThe service is slow, the staff aren't very attentive, and the girl that made my burrito was useless. As soon as I started to open the foil wrap the burrito started falling apart. In the end it's really not that big of a deal but if I wanted a burrito bowl I would have ordered one.\n\nProbably the worst part about this location is the wait time to get your food. The dining area is never all that busy but the line is always at least 15 to 20 mins long. The staff just move slowly plain and simple. \n\nI will continue to enjoy chipotle, but I don't think I will be returning to this location again, not worth it."
14201,4,"Great food! Our service was excellent from Pierre. It's quite reasonable for Vegas, but still high for the real world."
24403,4,"Wonderful little cheese shop with a variety of cheeses you've never heard of or heard of but never tasted. You can buy small pieces - orphans, they call them - so that you can taste without spending a bundle. There are gifts for foodies, too: jams, confits, crackers, etc. Really friendly staff and great sandwiches. Wish this had been around during my days at UW-Madison."
33100,4,"You can see instruments from all over the world, and actually hear the music played on them via headphones.  The teens were especially interested in the instruments owned by Elvis, John Lennon and Eric Clapton.  We were there for 2+ hours.  It was $36 for all of us and well worth it."
48584,3,"I like the pillows in the booths. \nI dislike the length of time it takes to get a shot of wheatgrass.\nThe juices and smoothies taste amazing and fresh.\nThe prices are ridiculously high. \nClean, great decor, aesthetically pleasing.\nNo patio or outdoor seating."
6879,4,Easily my favorite restaurant in Madison. Very attentive waitstaff. I've never had a dish here that I didn't like.
44472,3,My favorite ramen on the Eastside! So glad I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to get some great ramen. Our server is always so nice and sweet & she practically knows me already! My favorite is the Fukumimi Ramen with thick noodles and extra egg! YUMMMMM!
39543,1,"Well, they definitely enforce the dress code. Ladies, don't rely on your looks! If you aren't wearing the shortest dress ever, forget it. The club felt like a cheesy version of Vegas and everything was totally overpriced. If not for the good company of friends, I would've peaced out to a more comfortable club.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this club is the entire attitude. On their Facebook page they happily say Scottsdale is \""going downhill\"" and credit themselves with bringing them out of it by having a retarded dress code. They think the \""upper class\"" should remain the upper class. Right, you charge $10 for a cover in Arizona. Go to LA where they charge $45 or more for a mediocre club and get back to me about that upper class. \n\n\nOnly pros - the bathroom was interesting. Bizarre really. Not bad, not good, just different. Good place for hitting on people. The staff was actually strangely nice to people in line. One guy was particularly hot and funky."
43859,0,"I think this is not a new buffet in town!! I just went there on Thanksgiving day, which is not the first Thanksgiving day. OMG I have to wait for 5 hours to be seated. Unprofessional management, there are a lot of table empty but no one clean it, so there are only 70% can provide to customers. 30% left unattended. \n\nThey charge for $10.- extra for Thanksgiving but no sign posted. \n\nThere have only 2 staffs working for almost 500 customers. Those 2 staffs served only their \""DIAMOND\"" guest. The rest, just keep waiting, they don't care!!! \n\nWhen I complain to one of their staff, she complain to manager, who standing and do nothing, I just got bluffs back that he will kick me out from the hotel!!! WTF \n\nHe treated his staff better than his customers.\n\nThe food is great!! but I lost my appertise already."
16616,1,"It wasn't terrible, It wasn't great. The group I was with had some steak mishaps with the wrong level of cookness. \n\nRaves were the lobster pasta and the salads (not the wedge salad, which I think are stupid anyway). The anchovies were dry. \n\nCrab cakes were good but I've had better. \n\nService was on top of their game, gratuity was included for 8 people so they got double tipped, and didn't bring it to our attention. Our bad. \n\nI expected more from this place."
3290,3,"I did not play golf or eat at the restaurant - so this review is on lodging only. \n\nWe planned a surprise baby shower for several out of town guests (we were from out of town, too) and chose this location for group lodging. \n\nThe rooms are excellent for the price - the entire resort consists of 1-bedroom suites, either King or Queen plus a pull-out couch. Huge bathroom with Jacuzzi tub and separate shower, plenty of counter / mirror space, a full-size refrigerator, plus sink, dishes and utensils, and microwave. An outdoor seating area (which we didn't use, since we were here during monsoon season in Phoenix!). \n\nUnlike many other hotels & resorts, Orange Tree doesn't charge you extra for kids staying in the room, so we truly paid $60 per night for the 4 of us. Free wireless internet. \n\nWe had an issue with mosquitoes in our room -- staff promptly handled it and also took something off the bill for the inconvenience. Customer service was top-notch. \n\nBeds are all posturepedic (think \""memory foam\"") and outrageously comfortable. Plus the bedroom closes off from the rest of the suite, so it stays nice and dark in there. \n\nThe pool is very nice - lots of covered seating, and it's shady and comfortable after about 5PM. Plenty of shallow area for smaller kids to play in. \n\nMy only complaint is that unless you wind up in building #1, you cannot park anywhere near your room -- so if you forget something in the car, it's a 7-minute walk each way (from building 8, where we were) to the parking lot. From the lobby to the rooms, you can request someone pick you up in a golf cart. But I suppose the resort is designed with golfers in mind, who generally don't mind walking, even in the heat. For me, I prefer not to sweat if I don't have to, so I didn't like having so far to go each time we had to take our little ones to the car."
8107,4,Food is absolutely unbelievable for a bar. Even the guacamole is amazing. Probably the best quesadilla I've had in my life and the green chili burger is to die for. Drinks are always filled and they always make sure you have everything you need (like extra guac). Great cheap eatery.
26929,3,"Always friendly, Call ahead and they've got it waiting.  I wish they could just know by my # what I always order."
16088,4,You want a fantastic breakfast with a southwestern twist?  You found it.\n\nMy favorites are the enchiladas and eggs with pork green chili. Or the green chili meatloaf and eggs.  Or the tenderloin benedict with jalapeno hollandaise!  It's really just hard to go wrong here.\n\nA bit tricky to find as there is no sign but take the time and hunt it down I promise you'll love it!
15170,3,Service was great.  This price for dim sum at this place is the cheapest.  My favorites were  the tripe and the chicken feet.  Would definitely come here again.
40225,3,"Panel change out. I checked with several contractors and the prices ranged from $3600 to $1300. EE was not the lowest bid (but almost). I liked they were licensed, bonded and insured and a member of the BBB. Changing a panel is not rocket science but they did it right, took about 3 hours, the rest of the day was spent waiting for the City of Phoenix to earn their \""permit fee\"" - at least when I pay my doctor $150 I get an appointment-and, of course SRP to re-energize the system.. A four hour job wound up being all day- not always the case, just be warned.  I had good communications with Tamira, they kept me up-to-date and even filed the permit for me at no extra charge. Even had Greg add a dedicated circuit while they were waiting around!"
22240,1,"Same feeling as Matt E. Tried it again in hopes for a better experience. Sunday morning , NO muffins! Really? Asked for iced hot choc for my son, got hot. Asked for burrito for here, got it to go. Food was 25 minutes! Coffee was in a to go cup, wanted to dine here. All tables were dirty, I had to clean my own table. Service was average- but everytime there's an excuse \""were short handed\"". I'm not coming back! The manager/ owner needs to figure it out. It's the technology age: take all these yelp reviews and fix the issues to re-gain business."
1819,4,"Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \""happy hour\""; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream, perfectly made, and full of flavor!"
39468,4,"This is a great place to study, work, or meet up with a friend. They have tea as well, which is perfect for me since I'm more of a tea drinker! I usually order the Earl Grey or Jasmine tea. They bring it out in a French press and brew it for you! So you can make about 4 cups of tea! Today I'm trying out the Chai Tea Latte for the first time and it's delicious. I recommend this place, they have free wifi and outdoor seating."
4062,1,"This place drives me nuts!  It's very convenient for me to drop in and I'm mostly satisfied with their food, it's just that they are so slooooow in the drive-thru.  On my last visit I couldn't even order at the menu.  I had to roll up to the window and give my order.  It's not that the menu wasn't working, the gal just wasn't listening or hearing me correctly or something.  I had a question and apparently questions don't fly out at the menu.  When I got to the window and asked \""can you leave a few fries w/o chili on them?\"" the look she gave me was complete bewilderment - like nobody had ever asked her a question before.  Frustrating.  I'll go here again because it's on the right side of the freeway, on my way everywhere."
43179,4,"This place is the best, cheap, good and fast!  I know other Mexican chains are more common throughout the valley but this place is so good.  Just writing about it makes me want to get in the car right now and go get some.  I love all of their breakfast burritos but specifically like potato egg and cheese one.  The classic 2 taco meal is another good way to go.  It's open 24 hours and has a drive-through.  We've actually never been inside.  My only minor complaint is that the tea always kinda old tasting.  Everything else is super fresh and delicious, though!"
23196,2,"Stopped in this past Saturday. Had a bottle of sparkling rose ( a favorite) and a couple of glasses of wine. Things are different now-menu is smaller, seafood entrees are priced higher and the grilled pound cake dessert can't compare to the donuts.  Sliders were still good, speckled trout entree was pricey at $26 for a not too big portion. The shop was still very crowded and the servers are as friendly and efficient as ever, when they are not running around.  We liked the \""old\"" Foxcroft better.\n\nP.S.- website menu is out of date."
15589,1,"I was disappointed in their happy hour.  Mostly older folks and the bar is full by 5:15 pm.  The burger was really weak.  Hopdoddy, Zinburger and other places have much better burgers.\n\nThe chocolate lava cake was very good.\n\nAlso, I had a $50 gift card and they made me use the whole thing if I wanted to pay for my $35 bill with the card.  That's right, I wasted $15 on my gift card because I really don't care to come back."
31094,0,"I got a slightly bad feeling when I walked in to pick up our carry out order. It smelled like sewage!  There were three servers chit chatting in the front and one quickly pointed to the bar when I told the I was picking up. The small bar was fairly full, and lots of conversations going on. I had to stand behind two people who were really involved in conversation and I was practically on top of them and awkward. The bar tender didn't acknowledge me for a few minutes even though she looked right at me. Finally she grabbed my order and was super rude. She was definitely having a bad day.  The place was empty other than the bar, and I don't know why they don't use the servers who aren't busy to take care of the carry out orders!?\n\nFinally got home with the food.  Wow.  My husband opened his Jumbo Smoked Chicken dinner.  It was quite small, and just unappealing altogether.  Posted a photo of it, check it out.  The taste was like \""rubbery ham\"".  GROSS.  Next I opened my smoked chicken breast sandwich.  Bun = hard, meat = full of fat chunks and gristle, sauce = the cheapest bottle at the store . Had to take off more than half of the \""meat\"".  You can get better meat in precooked packages at the grocery store.  \n\nI will never eat here again and can not believe people go here at all.  NASTY."
20461,4,A friend told me about this place after my regular hairstylist moved back to Canada. I was very impressed with Molly Rose! She did an awesome job with my cut and color. She is my new go-to-hair expert! I got tons of compliments after going to see her.
3902,2,Make your bowl. The place was big and clean. Very polite staff.
37926,2,"For a fusion place...not bad.\n\nMinus major points for their take-out service: I have NO IDEA why they restrict the takeout menu, and why they were out of so many things.  Unacceptable, especially for dinner.  And the menu restriction is a total cop-out.  \n\nLamb Dumplings: had good flavor, but VERY haute gourmet Vegas portions (meaning the dumplings are SMALL!)  It's what I expected, so no loss of points there.  \n\nTacos: ordered a few of them as an assortment (they ran out of duck tongue...VERY VERY disappointing).  The tacos were pretty spot-on; nothing incredible though.  \n\nI'll have to dine-in next time.  Maybe I'll update with more stars if the other menu options are better."
21826,3,"I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay $75 for the prix fixe menu here, but this time around, a sales rep did it for us!\n\nThe wine angels were cool to watch.  I kind of dug the pc wine tablet, but the battery died on our first one and wiped out our selections (making our NY sales rep rather cranky).  They quickly brought us another, but with all the options, we couldn't remember what we'd originally ordered.  The sommelier was quick to help us make new choices, and we were off!\n\nAmuse Bouche:  Sunchoke Soup - Delicious, but I thought it was kind of odd that they would bring a non veggie item for everyone to taste without announcing the vast amounts of bacon in it...  what if one of us had been a vegetarian??\n\nMy Choices:  To Start  - French onion soup with foie gras and truffles AND puff pastry top....  ummm...  yummy!!!  Verrrrrry rich.  Honestly, I could have stopped there.  Main - Roasted rack of lamb (med/rare...leaning more towards rare) with nicoise olives, preserved tomato and braised flageolet beans... very happy with my dinner.  I love it when a dish comes to the table perfectly seasoned!\n\nJ:  To Start  - Scallop trio which consisted of a truffle encrusted scallop, a scallop wonton, and scallop ceviche.  He snarfed it all down in record time (unlike his wine...which I was all too happy to help him with...  LIGHTWEIGHT)!  Main - Surf and Turf:  Braised short ribs and butter poached lobster.  He ate all of the ribs and lobster, but there was a little dish of some sort of seafood mousse that he did not enjoy at all.\n\nSales rep:  To Start - Ahi Tuna Duo:  He said it was delicious.  There was tuna tartare over Comice pear chutney, and seared tuna with ginger and cilantro.  Main - Surf and Turf:  same result as J.\n\nThe rep insisted on ordering a dessert while J continued to struggle with the 3 large glasses of wine he had accumulated...  Lydia to the rescue!!!  Unfortunately, this led to me being just drunk enough to let our equally inebriated sales rep spoon feed me some of the chocolate souffle.  Hmmmm...  only slightly humiliating!  Oops!\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my meal, and the service was excellent."
24932,3,"Tasty burgers, shake and fries. Fries weren't hot, just warm."
44158,0,"Worst customer service. Waiting over an hour for my \""freaky fast\"" food to be delivered. Days later, I realized my credit card was charged incorrectly. Instead of the management being customer service orientated and making it an easy situation to fix; they were the exact opposite. I will never be returning, nor would I recommend it to any friends or families in the neighborhood."
29046,3,"Beautiful resort away from the crazy strip.\n The pool is really nice, cool poolside bar with built in ice strip to keep your drink cold. I've been to the pool for a few events, and it never feels crowded, there's lots of room, never had a bad time.\n I've eaten the buffet here and its pretty tasty, nice variety, free wine (NICE!). Hash House A Go Go is okay, big portions is their thing, its a chain so the food is average. Babycakes has gelato and pastries and specialty coffees, don't miss the gelato (good stuff).\nI haven't really gambled here, but I'm sure I will one of these days. I know their free gifts when you have a players card are much better than some of the junk other resorts give away.\nI also have never seen their rooms, so I can't comment on them."
33059,0,I had a horrible experience today. Their driver admitted to not reading my delivery instructions and yet they did nothing to rectify the mistake. They ruined a special tradition my husband and I have and I would never use or recommend them. It was a very costly disappointment.
32746,3,"*3.5 stars, bumping it to 4 stars for the nice peeps and the quick seating.\n\nDear Cyros, \nThanks for being conveniently located to South Park and a low key sushi joint. \n\nHubs and I ducked in here one very rainy Thursday and it was SLAMMED. So slammed that the servers, owner and hostess thanked us for our patience. That was indeed a nice touch. That being said, I'm really glad we made a last minute Open Table reserv and were seated right away. The place itself has simple, yet modern decor. Not too many frills and not too many tables either. But that's ok, as long as the food is delicious it doesn't matter much to me!\n\nWe ordered a handful of rolls and one appetizer...\n\nYellowtail Hamachi with Jalapeno: Fresh, thin slices of yellowtail topped with slices of jalapeno and a peppery, citrus-y sauce. The fish was great and I liked the taste of the sauce, but not the consistency. It was a bit grainy.\n\nNobu Fire roll: Really fresh fish and super duper spicy. Like I was draining my water over and over again spicy. Next time I'm getting the sauce on the side. \n\nSpicy Tuna roll: Their basic spicy tuna. As others, very fresh.\n\nFirey Tuna Roll: Another spicy one with a generous helping of spicy tuna on top. \n\nOverall, Cyros is a pleasant sushi stop in Southpark. Will I be a lifer here? Mmm, I don't know...as another South Park sushi joint set the bar pretty high in my opinion."
38586,3,"Even though my husband and I love this place...the food, the venue, the music, the waitstaff, I can not give them a 5 because we just don't get why this place wouldn't be willing to book some bands earlier in the evening and even afternoons on the weekends.  I mean, there was a time where we had jobs that kept us up to the wee hours, but those days are over and we just can't get a 9:30pm or later start anymore...it kills us because of course we love live music and love to stay the duration! Then the next day we are always pissed at ourselves and then that keeps us from going to Vamp'd for another 4 or 5 months. We really think they would be surprised at how many would like an earlier show as well."
38063,3,"The 4 star rating is not for the pizza alone (which is pretty good, not the best I have ever had but still very very decent, especially the white)... but rather for the \""secret\"" factor, the location and just the fun it involves getting there, also the Cosmo is one of my favorite casinos on the strip."
4612,2,"I was craving sushi, my fiance was craving teppanayki so Osaka seemed like the perfect place to have both. \n\nI liked how they seemed to purposely make sure each teppanyaki party got it's own table and chef. This could have been because they were mostly empty, but I did appreciate having our own table. \n\nSushi was just OK. It was tightly rolled and they had a nice selection, but the negi hama I had was just OK. Not rotten, not super fresh.. just eh. I did love, however, that they offered half rolls. It was great to be able to get some variety. For ~$15 I was able to try 3 1/2 rolls.. this worked out really well. The rolls with all cooked stuff (shrimp tempura, etc) were great.. but that's hard to screw up. \n\nTeppanyaki was pretty good. Filet mignon was off the hook - seriously the best steak I've had at a  teppanyaki place..very tender and cooked really well. The chicken, sadly, was random end pieces and not too great. Lots of chewy grisley pieces.. eww. The fried rice and veggies were just average. \n\nOverally not a *bad* place , but nothing special. As teppanyaki and sushi are pretty expensive, I'd probably only come back here for the lunch specials. I'm not sure the quality justifies the dinner prices."
45152,1,"The staff were friendly enough and the place looked nice. I had a green curry with chicken it came filled with vegetables and a good size serving BUT as other reviews have noted, peas have no place in a curry. They tasted weird and out of place. And the deal breaker for me was the curry itself. The chicken had a greyish blue tinge because the curry quite obviously had some sort of food dye in it. It was a bright minty green. If you make this using proper ingredients you don't need to do this. It had a thai-ish taste but clearly not well made. Disappointing and unappetising."
12946,3,"If there's something I developed a taste for over the last couple of years, it is definitely French cuisine. My girlfriend loves everything French, especially the food. I decided to take her here for our two year anniversary and I can't say that my expectations weren't met. The menu isn't a run-on book, it's a one page array of all things tasty. Les Poissons (hee hee hee, hah hah hah) looked and smelled fantastic. The wine was affordable per glass. We ordered the \""Frangria,\"" the French version of Sangria which was quite the punch.\n\nI have this weird sense of things where I judge a place I eat by what they give you for free, in this case the bread. Naturally, we sat down and were greeted with a French baguette accompanied by some delicious butter and an amuse bouche, which was some kind of pickled apple concoction. The bread was delicious, it's lead me to one of those moments where I said \""I could just come here for the bread\"" and this was no lie. All of that was delicious. We were discretely told about the menu and placed our orders, which came out warm and fresh right away.\n\nI ordered the Beef Wellington, the house special on Sunday and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Bordelaise. My beef wellington was.....nucking futs delicious. I've always wanted to try a wellington and oh my gosh was it delicious. The beef was tender and succulent, cooked just the way I like it. The generous portion of beef was surrounded by a puff pastry which was to die for. The wellington was served with a saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic side, which was on point. I tried some of the steak my girlfriend ordered and it was, you may as well write the rest of this, AMAZING. The food was cooked perfectly and the portions were just enough to get me  full to the brim. \n\nTo make matters \""worse,\"" we order the Bananas Fosters Crepes for dessert. Gluttony became our ruler at this point as we shoveled this behemoth of a dessert down our bellies completely satisfied with the meal as a whole. My only gripe was that our waitress was a little inattentive once we got our food. As we didn't see her from the moment we got our food till we were done, looking around for her to come by. Regardless, that would not be the deciding factor if I come back because I definitely will. \n\nGentleman, if you have a date and you want to impress her, go on and take her here. We sat inside but I hear the patio is just as nice. This is a great place for tourists and LOCALS alike."
25582,3,"So this place was packed when we got here, so we opted just to get a pastry to go.  We had the chaussons aux pommes, mmmm good.  The apple was a little tart and not too sweet.  The pastry shell itself was delicious, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  We wish we were able to fully enjoy what this place had to offer after having the pastry we wanted more! Definitely worth checking out!"
33759,3,Great sales and a staff that's not too stuck up makes this an above average A&F
6232,1,"It had been a couple of years since we visited, and the service (and cleanliness) seems to have gone downhill. \n\nWe got there around 8:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and it wasn't crowded at all... however, it took so long for our waiter to come by that we were about to get up and leave. He finally showed up, and I ordered the banana walnut pancakes with bacon while the fella ordered sausage and eggs over-well.\n\nTo be fair, it IS called the Original Pancake House, so sausage and eggs probably aren't the way to go, but the fella got the driest-looking hockey puck sausages I've ever seen. His plate was just sad. My pancakes were good, but they just had a few slices of bananas and walnuts on top - it seemed odd considering most banana pancakes I've had had the bananas already in the batter. The bacon was solid.\n\nAs we left, the place was pretty packed, so maybe the service gets better as they get busier? I won't be in a hurry to go back."
26641,1,"I tried this place for lunch, and don't think I'll be going back.  \n\nI love panang curry, and was really dissappointed here.  I liked the heat this curry packed, but the lemon zing was wayyyyy too overpowering.... so much so that I didn't even eat the left overs  (and I always eat leftovers)!!\n\nFurthermore, this place was pretty pricey... for lunch I paid 10+ just for the curry and brown rice!\n\nTry Thai Basil if you're in the Tempe area, their curry is to die for!"
41825,4,"Went to Carhops for first time ever today, never went to West Liberty location. As a downtown homeowner I love ANYPLACE that opens in downtown beause it's my neirbhorhood. \n\nWent in and had the reuben. The biggest baddest reuben I've ever seen. Good thick crisp bread, then corned beef piled so high it's amazing. Gooey melted swiss, tangy 1000 Island, thickest reuben I've ever seen. And did I mention how awesome the crispy thick cut rye was? Mmm! \n\nHand cut fries, basic cheese sauce but the fries were plentiful, crispy, and seasoned real nice. \n\nPlace is very clean, and it's open til' 6pm. Hoping when word gets out how awesome it is their hours will go later at nite. The menu looks amazing can't wait to get back and try a burger. Food also came out very fast, I ordered at 5 and was eating at 5:07."
22435,0,"Nice employees, Salad Bar is good Deserts are ok but damn for almost $12.00 I could have had a better meal at Denny's which is where I will go next time I think I want to eat here."
38929,3,"I have to say, this place was a delightful surprise.  I had seen it so many times during my driving around, and figured I'd finally stop.  \nI was pleasantly surpised with the overall experience!\nThe decor, the food, the wait staff, the extensive menu, all of it really made me continue to go back time and time again.  The pink sauce they put on the Shrimp Tacos makes all the difference.\n\nLove it"
29399,1,"Was craving a frozen hot chocolate all week long prior to going to Vegas, so I walked down here after doing a bit of shopping at the Forum shops. Seeing as how I was ONLY gonna get a frozen hot chocolate, I went to the line outside and thought, oh, this is going to move fast cuz there's only 4 people in front of me. \n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\n20 min later, I finally get to the front of the line. SLOWEST MOVING LINE EVER! Why do they not have more people working here when the line moves at the speed of molasses. My grandma can do cartwheels faster. \n\nAnywhoo, after paying a ridiculous $10 and waiting over 20 min, i finally had my meh frozen hot chocolate. Wasn't as good as the first time I had it. I feel sorry for the people who were waiting behind me in the growing line."

26730,0,"There 2 good items at Ketzal.  1.  The bar!  Good selection of Tequilas.  2.  The chips and salsa sampler.  (Which is not complimentary anymore).    You have to seat yourself.   The waiter and waitress both missed on the bringing us water after we requested it.    My wife went to the bar to get water.    A third waiter brought us the water.   The drink order was wrong, but if you like free drinks......   The rice and beans are bad.  They were not even hot. Do not come here for the food.   I hope Ketzal gets a new chef before they open at 101 and Tatum."
12458,1,Maybe expectation is too high on the name 'Nobu'.\nThe black cod with miso was just okay - nothing special really.\nThe sushi is good. Nothing really 'wow' me.. \nWe had Tapan's dinner too... again.. it was so-so. \nThe bill came to 170 for the 2 of us. \nOh.. talked about the atmosphere. It's noisy and not well decorated at all =(
18832,1,"Wasn't too impressed with this restaurant. I heard you could build your own creations similar to a Subway style place. They had 3 options of meat, none of which were my favorites, one type of cheese and very limited extras. The girl rolling the burrito was extremely slow at doing so-took her forever to roll it up. I worked at a Mexican restaurant and know it does not take this long!! THe line got really long due to her. The staff was really friendly and nice and they patrolled the drink bar very well, keeping it stocked and cleaned. Overall, they tried hard, but the concept was lacking at best. I won't be back."
7730,1,"Ambience is great. Love the band and dj on Friday and Saturday nights. Food is ok. The service, however, is horrible. Been going there for a few years and the service keeps getting worse (with the exception of Mike)."
17178,0,Probably fine if you are looking for a hostel like experience.  Avoid at all costs otherwise.  Very bad for business travelers and a poor value for recreational visitors as well.  Still cringing at the $12 buffet of make-it-yourself instant oatmeal.\n\nA memorably bad hotel.
42584,1,"If you like going to clubs, you will love this place. If you value good service, a friendly attitude, really good food, and a good value, go somewhere else.\n\nThis is a classic case of poor management. Both times I went there, we found tables available, but were told to wait 15-20 minutes.\n\nThe first time, I had a plane to catch. By the time I was seated, and they finally came over to take our order, I had to leave.\n\nThe second time, I gave them a chance. Long wait, and by the time one of the \""hip\"" waitresses came over, the ice in my soft drink had melted. \n\nThe burgers were decent, but honestly, there is a Japanese Burger truck that goes to various locations. It's a lot better, a lot more fun, and better priced. \n\nAs I said before, the crowd that goes here seems really \""in\"" and \""trendy\"", and act like they are sitting at VIP Tables in a Club.  The waitresses act like they are cocktail waitresses at a club. The management thinks they are really cool.\n\nIf they had a product that justified this arrogant attitude, fine. My wife thought they had great Sweet Potato Fries. That's about it."
43512,4,"t's back!  They have moved to the old Blockbuster Space in Quail Corners at 8400-A Park Road..  By far the best Salsarita's location in Charlotte.  (I thought that about the old location as well).  Ingredients are fresh, and the quality is impeccable."
43740,3,I was skepticaly of this idea. But my friend wanted to go for her birthday..\n\nPRETTY FREAKN GOOD!\n\ni'd go back...not much else to say. definitely get custard in your shaved ice thing..I don't even know what to call it still.. I liked the fruity and creaminess
14722,4,"Wow what a quiet hidden gem in the middle of a loud casino. Food, service, outdoor patio all A++ amazing place for lunch on the patio overlooking golf course and waterfall."
28974,4,I ordered the Cajan style ribeye which is marinated for 36 hour and it was delicious. Good customer service and clean.
44236,3,"Creative, fresh, tasty & here to stay!\nI have had many items on the menu, breakfast and lunch, enjoyed it all."
44419,3,"Had my birthday dinner there on Monday night and it was delish!  This high praise is a BIG deal because I almost never have pizza and have high expectation of the Upward group as well!  The pizzas and pasta were wonderful although we over ordered for our group size but the real star was the wine cooler.  With cute presentation and great flavors, these bevvies were a hit.  I dig the ambiance and the drive through pick up lane and am betting this concept multiplies quickly.  One small quibble: the food is fairly high priced as pizza goes, which I don't mind but I really think the wine coolers should be priced more humbly (or  have specials that make up for it)."
15095,4,"I highly recommend this hotel. Not only are the rooms cute, clean, equipped with cooking utensils, and cozy, but the staff are EXTREMELY nice and professional. My dog got loose from her leash and sprinted off and Dominique and Marissa spent  1+ hrs of their time to help me find my dog. They were running and seemed as though they weren't going to stop until they were sure that my dog was back in my arms. Thank you so much!"
25623,2,"Pros\n- Great ambience\n- Friendly staff\n- Great apps\n- Good tomato sauce\n- Fair pricing\n\nCons\n- Except for the duck sausage pizza, menu is uninspired\n- Pizza/cheese was a touch too oily/soggy in the middle"
29856,0,"GROSS!!! I threw my burrito away it was so bad!! First understand I like two things from hole in the wall mexican places; bean and cheese burritos and nachos. Yup...that's my list. I know I'm not creative with my choices but what I like is the easiest thing to make so I rarely find a bad one. My fianc\u00e9es friend goes on about how great this place is, so when the craving for nachos hit we went here. I didn't order the nachos because they put nachos cheese on it. I want real shredded greasy cheese, not Taco Bell crap. I ordered the bean and cheese and almost spit it out!! It was whole beans!! Not refried, not slightly mashed, not nothing!! They opened a can of beans, heated them, dumped them on with a slice or two of something they wanted me to believe was cheese, and kinda grilled the tortilla. I ate three bits and after dumping hot sause on it I finally just threw it away. Next time I'll stick to what I know is good; Roberto's!!"
41548,1,"Small bakery with a decent variety of breads&cakes inside the Greenland Market.\n\nEvery time I shop at Greenland, I can't help but to stop at the bakery on my way out. I've tried a good amount of different types of baked goods, and I'm let down every time. The breads just don't taste good. Some are too dry, some too bland, etc. This may be because I'm from Los Angeles where there are hundreds of franchise korean bakeries that know what they're doing. This may also contribute to my opinion on the appearance of the goods. The packaging on some of the goods are just not professional - scotch tape all around the packaging? really? Also, the coffee bun just looks like they've tried to copy something and just hasn't worked out. \n\nThe pizza bread is fine - can't go wrong with that.\nBreads with beans inside  are fine too.\n\nOverall, the goods look and taste like an amateur baker tried to make some goods at home.\n\nOnto the service... the older lady I've seen there a couple times seems to treat me depending on her mood. This may be because I'm younger. A few times I would go, and she wouldn't say a word to me, ring me up, mumble the total, and give me the change. I said thank you in korean. No response. Recently, I went, and there was a good amount of people browsing around. She was a little more friendly."
41469,0,"They won't have anything hot and ready. Slow everything. Save your receipt, because they won't remember your order. Check your order before leaving. Expect to wait 30 minutes for anything.\n\nSeriously, I wish I could give them negative stars. Just the worst."
19297,3,Love the lunch specials here.  Such a great spot for lunch and the food is delicious.  The service has always been great too.
32262,1,I had an inspection and oil change. There was only one guy working alone and he communicated like a cave man. I will not be back.
45813,1,"Sad to say, this was a disappointment.  We eat out quite a bit and try all the new restaurants.  The picture in Phoenix Magazine made the restaurant look bright and cheerful....but thought it was quite the opposite.  Interesting menu...the chips were great, but, unfortunately, the food was just \""ok\"".  There are many other places in town that serve very good Mexican food.  In Amy's review, she said she \""breaks out in hives when she has to eat in Scottsdale....well I felt the same with the clientele in this restaurant."
32582,3,"I went to Pinnacle Grille with my girlfriend for lunch.  The menu really looks awesome, but unfortunately neither of us were very hungry.  I ended up getting the Cobb salad and it was really good.  Everything was fresh, the greens, the grilled chicken, the bleu cheese, everything.  The  vinaigrette was the one thing I wasn't super pleased with.  So, if you get this salad, try a different dressing.  My girlfriend got the fat free sesame dressing on her salad, it was really good.\n\nI really liked the ambiance and the service was really good.  I think the only thing keeping this place from being really popular is the location, it's like being on the moon out there!  However, I would certainly go back if I was in the area again."
20777,2,"I've eaten here twice when I was staying at Treasure Island. The Pho is just okay but it'll do in a pinch. It probably smells better than it tastes.\n\nI've tried to veggie spring rolls which were decent, but the peanut sauce is just okay - kind of coco-nutty. \n\nI got the Pho Tai and my friend got the Veggie Pho.  My soup was not super tasty but had lots of pieces of beef but very little noodles.  My friend enjoyed her soup - had bak choy, mushrooms and corn.  Little pricey for pho as you can get an awesome tasting bowl in LA for like 7 dollars.\n\nWaitress was nice and the place was clean."
28162,3,"A must every time we visit Las Vegas! \n\nYou know this place sells alot of egg dishes when the delivery truck delivers eggs by the stacked case - and many of them.\n\nYou can get your egg dishes just about any way you like them and know that you'll have a good experience. I tend to favorite the California Omelet which has tomato, fresh avocado and mushrooms, along with melted Swiss and hollandaise sauce. The omelet alone is more than enough at 3 eggs, but they include some great potatoes (or another side) and a banana nut muffin which is usually good, but this time tasted a tad off. I didn't mind the muffin, but my kids didn't enjoy them as much this time.\n\nTheir service style is interesting - flip your metallic \""egg\"" at the table if you're unhappy to get someone's attention. Neat concept!\n\nWarning - portions are LARGE. If you're traveling, you'll likely feel like you're wasting food unless you choose to share (they may charge for that, but it's not excessive). After the muffins, I could only eat \""most of the omelet and a small bit of potatoes before feeling stuffed."
40473,4,"Rainbow donuts has really good fresh donuts. The staff is very friendly. I usually will pick some up for an event. They have a good variety.

13442,3,"This review is more for the food court than the stores. First a brief review of the stores mainly they have a great selection of stores Nike, Adidas, Oakley, Guess, D&G and many more expect at least more than a couple of hours to go through the whole thing keep in mind this is all outdoors so dress accordingly especially during the summertime. Now on to the food court well not much of a selection you have Japanese and Chinese, Subway and Italian I actually had pizza for lunch it was ok good enough for my taste buds i also got to sample the teri chicken from the Japanese place and orange chicken from the Chinese place both were good but they could have better food."
44084,0,"I wish I could put negative stars on here.... Went to get a oil changed and tire rotation when I got my car back the radio didn't work, all the electric had been tripped and I now need a serious alignment.

15305,2,"Lucille's is a 1950's-eque BBQ joint located right next to the Green Valley Ranch Casino. If you go on a weekend night, I can guarantee that you're going to waiting for a table. A few of my coworkers and I went to Lucille's for lunch. And here's the review:\n\nThe Good: \nI had a BBQ salad and the meat, though there was not much on the plate, was flavorful and tender. I got to try some of my friend's brisket, and it too was juicy anf flavored nicely. I love that all of their drinks come in mason jars, and their menu offers a variety of BBQ items to choose from. In addition, they have an in-house smoker so the aroma of BBQ hits you right when you walk through the door.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe service is friendly enough, but sometime it felt like we were being rushed.  For lunch on a Wednesday, it was quite crowded, and we had to request refills on our drinks. In addition, their prices are a bit high for the amount of food you actually get. I've been to several BBQ places, and Lucille's seems to focus on being a bit more upscale than their competitors. \n\nWill I return? Probably. But, this is not my first choice in BBQ."
15356,2,"Good stuff - trust me, go with the Woody Allen.  It's huge and filled with tasty pastrami and corned beef.  Relatively lean pastrami, and the horseradish mustard on the table is a great match.  (I made a kickass corned beef & pastrami hash with the leftovers today.)\n\nYesterday I tried the cheese blintzes and a potato pancake.  Blintzes... fried?  Deep-fryer action?  Very odd, but the filling was fantastic.  The potato pancake was good, not too greasy, some noticeable onion action in there.  But here is where they lose a star from me - $13 for three small blintzes.  $5 for a decent-sized potato pancake.  I think I was offended by the receipt which listed the potato pancake as \""latkes\"" - as in multiple items.  Uh, no, you really did charge me $5 for one latke. \n\nService was also really slow.  But this was the best deli dining I've experienced east of the Mississippi (not including Canter's in LA)."
8965,4,"Perfect place for take-out.  The dining area isn't the fanciest, but the food is great."
8997,2,Best donuts in South Phoenix. It is the one thing that makes working over there totally worth it. The maple bar is fantastic.
1469,1,"I'm adding to the chorus of \""the people here are incredibly rude.\"" They have this policy that you must leave behind two yards of fabric or you have to buy all of it - except it's not exactly uniformly enforced. I went to buy fabric today to make blankets for gifts, and it took me ages to sort through the leaning tower of fleece just to *find something that was at least a yard*!! There were so many pieces of fabric that had to be just six inches, 10 inches, maybe a foot and a half...hardly anything you can use for almost any sort of project. \n\nWhen I *finally* found something that was at least a yard and had a cute pattern, I took it to be cut. The woman cutting my fabric insisted I had to get additional yards of one type that I didn't even need because otherwise I'd be leaving a yard behind here and there and that was against their policy. She didn't even explain it nicely, she just said \""did you read the paper?\"" and pointed at it. I would've just returned those pieces and went back to get alternatives from the giant pile, but I had spent so much time finding at least a yard each that I was now running late.\n\nSo now I have FAR more fabric than I needed and I feel super ripped off. They have a good selection, but I'm not going back. It hardly matters if the fabric is decently priced when you have to cross your fingers and toes you'll find at least a yard of it, and then end up paying out of the rear for extra. Ugh."
46287,3,I first was introduced to this restaurant when living in Fort Worth Texas for a year. I loved this place! It's a Brazilian churrascaria  which really means it's a Brazilian cowboy barbecue. Sounds simple enough but it's better!!! \nThis is an all you can eat monster meat bonanza like nothing you have experienced before unless you've eaten here.\nIt's an all you can eat buffet but here's the twist... servers walk around with sword like skewers full of the best cuts of meat cooked to perfection. You have a little disk you flip over from red for no I'm good to green which is load me up with meat. This is the highlight of this wonderful place to eat. That isn't to take away from the salad bar which has many great items itself such as the prosciutto or the awesome cheeses. Did I also mention that yes they also have a full service bar that is spot on!
2264,2,"I've only transferred through the PHO a couple times (so I can't comment on the security), but I think it's just A-OK. \n\nHighlights\n+Gates have plush seats.\n+Not overwhelmingly large, so going from terminal to another isn't too bad. (Vy is absolutely right.)\n+Free WiFi.\n+The mountains surrounding the airport are gorgeous. \n\nDrawbacks:\n-I understand that airports have their fair share of chains, but this one seems to have slightly more.\n-Bathrooms are kind of bleh.\n-Not enough seats at gates. (Saw too many people sitting on the ground waiting for their flights.)\n-Too many people riding on the golf carts and drivers not telling people to get out of the way. (Like me.)\n\nThis airport is the definition of mediocrity."
22903,4,I have only been here once but let me say it was one of the best times EVER! The whole place is sooo sexy and cool. Love the girls dancing in such amazing outfits..loved the free bubbly even more!\nI drank so much I ended up dancing on a table with some girl..the hubby loved that!\nI need to get back again because I had so much flippin fun!!
5952,4,One of the few nice Chinese restaurants!
1489,4,THANK YOU TOY BOX!!\nI took my car to the Toy Box to have them take a second look at $800 worth of work - strut replacement - that another valley mechanic had quoted me.  Turns out there was nothing wrong with my struts and they saved me $800!!  Their honesty and integrity will be remembered and they have gained a customer for life!  Thanks again Phill and crew...you guys are the best!!
39304,3,"Still the best for tacos in vegas. Recommend el pastor, tasty and affordable, 99c!! The staff is welcoming and friendly and the complimentary salsa and chips is spicy but delicious, you can't stop eating it. Love this mom and pop restaurant."
429,2,"As an avid book reader (more like book inhaler!) I love the Charlotte library system but I sure don't love this location. Yes, they have a larger selection than any of the regional branches. Yes, they have more (and perhaps better trained) staff than the regional branches. And yes, they have more computers than the regional branches.\n\nBut wow, do they have a completely different customer demographic. How many libraries do you know that have a security office? And the stalls in the men's room have doors that are barely half-height?\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, then sure, stop in. But I wouldn't recommend making a special trip. You'll have a much better experience at almost any of the regional branches.\n\nNote - there is a drive-up book drop in the back."
34960,2,"So one of my friends invites a bunch of us to this new burger place that he discovered recently.  Says he and his girlfriend love the food here, and would love to go here as a group.  The burger place in question is none other than Bachi Burger, which appeared to take quite the beating when it came to service.  It had been a while since the place opened, so I figured any kinks in service would be ironed out by now.\n\nStopped by here tonight and I can safely say that there were no issues with the service.  Drinks were kept full, we were checked on regularly, servers brought extra silverware in case we all wanted to share a dessert etc.  No complaints there.  \n\nThe reason this place is getting three stars from me is that they seem to pile toppings onto burgers without know when to quit!  I got myself a Ronin burger, and it seemed that the Japanese cole slaw and katsu sauce were both fighting over who gets to my tastebuds first.  Yes, there were carmelized onions, miso dressing, and an egg on the burger, yet all these flavors were overpowered by the cole slaw and katsu.  Even the beef was overpowered by them; they also didn't ask how I wanted my beef cooked.  It was done medium well, while I prefer medium to keep some pink and juicyness in the middle of the patty.\n\nI also ordered a Vietnamese coffee; it wasn't as good as I've had at other restaurants.  The coffee is served and is still being strained when it is brought to your table.  It came out dark and had a strong aroma, which set my expectations high.  Sadly, the coffee wasn't that strong and ended up being overpowered by the milk.\n\nAll in all Bachi Burger is alright, and I'd probably stop by every once in a while if I lived nearby.  As is, with me living in the southwest, I doubt I'll be returning any time soon."
40352,3,Good spicy Thai food buffet
18204,1,Great food.  Buffet seems bigger than the one at Maharajah.\n\nProblem...... A cockroach ran up the wall behind my wife.   Waiter killed it.  No manager stopped by.  Needless to say we paid for our meal.  We never went back.  A shame too.   We really liked the food!
49028,0,"The food is bland, they LIE about the posted specials, the managers NEVER return phone calls and are magically NEVER in the office when you're attempting to reach them, and the so-called \""MANAGERS\"" are very unprofessional. I've personally witnessed the FAT one in the white coat yell at employees in the front of the restaurant. LIKE, WHAT? At least take them to the back office if you're going to throw a bitch fit."
26453,3,"Enough variety for me. Only reason I go to buffet - Shrimp, Oysters, Sushi and Salmon. They had all of these, so I'm happy. If you are looking for a quality buffet, skip this one . It didn't look clean and I had my waitress sit on our side table facing us while we eat. Annoyed, but I don't care much. Total bill without drinks, with tax - $22.64. \n\nI will come back here again over Lin's. I won't bring guests here though!"
4020,0,"I have been here before and the selection is okay and the people fine. I went in to sell some books today and the old woman behind the front desk was down-right rude. On top of that, she just meandered around as if we all had all the time in the world while she moved books back and forth between shelves. It was definitely a wasted trip for me and one that I will not ever again repeat. Next time I will go back to Bookmans."
5432,4,"I have been seeing Dr. Weisner for various ailments since May of 2000.  He has helped me recover from a serious car injury, and allowed me lead an active an healthy lifestyle.  \n\nAlways very professional and willing to spend time with you.  Great staff as well!"
43424,3,"Nostalgia. I'm an 80's kid so I came for the Thrifty's ice cream. I've actually been here a few times but tonight's visit was different in a good way. I got circus animal flavor ice cream with snickerdoodle and sugar cookies to make my sandwich. Because who's counting calories tonight...not me. F a diet. At least for tonight. \n\nIn the past the cookies were a bit on the hard side, not the best texture for a ice cream sandwich. Tonight's cookies were soft which made for a perfect sandwich. Their \""scoop\"" of ice cream is Huge. I'm guessing people may complain of price (this ain't the 80's anymore and we must get over the 25 cent a scoop deal) but when you're getting a product/treat like this you forget about $'s sometimes. \n\nStaff is friendly. Place is kept clean. Good amount of space. Bonus that they have the table style arcade game set up and cool unique sodas in their drink fridge. All I need is some MJ, Madonna, Boy George, Cindy Lauper on blast on the radio, some Ronald Reagan on the tube, some girls with biker shorts big aquanet hair and fanny packs and maybe i can give this place 5 stars."
1377,0,"I have noticed the trend in all the location but today was the worst.  Coffee was cold and the cream was warm.  The lettuce had a faint smell of bleach or ?  There was almost no breads out but a few drier ones.  I took one and it was cold and soggy.  No one cleared my table or even spoke to me though there were people doing that at other tables.  The frozen desert, chocolate, had no taste at all.  It was cold, creamy and without any flavoring.  The lady at the registered dropped 2 large stacks of glasses (all glasses are plastic or paper).  She and others picked them up from the floor and stacked them back up.  I watched as they gave them to the new customers.  What do you think would be on a floor? There is always lots of food but they obviously care nothing about food temperatures or bacteria on their dishes. I will not be returning."
48595,2,"Went here yesterday to get our sushi fix after a nice day of hiking icebox canyon.  Our party of 6 was famished and was quickly seated for lunch.  It wasn't very busy as it was a weekday and we were having a late lunch.  \""The sooner I can sit down, the sooner I can get started on stuffing my face!\"" is what I say.\n\nI know it's difficult to have a large party go for AYCE, but when the staff forgets about what you ordered and constantly have to be reminded of it, you know there's some organization issues in the back.  There were a couple of dishes that didn't even make it to the table before our check did.  Regardless, it was a good start, but the staff couldn't handle our giant appetites towards the end.\n\nSome notable dishes we had involved fresh fish and good flavor combinations.  Their maguro (red tuna) was excellent that day!  I'm normally a fan of salmon, but the nigiri to order was the maguro.  The redder, the better!  I also really enjoyed their Spider Roll (a classic) and their Double D Roll.  The Double D Roll was listed under their shrimp tempura special rolls and had great intermingling of flavors along with a little kick at the end.  It was one of our favorites!  Another plus was that they do not pack on the rice!\n\nNow on to the not-so-great dishes.  The shiro maguro (albacore) that we ordered came seared when we were under the impression that it would have been raw.  Upon eating it, you could definitely taste a distinct fishiness, which shouldn't be the case if it were fresh.  They also topped it with what tasted like the garlic sauce they usually put on top of garlic tuna.  Since this was my first time here, I wasn't sure if this was their norm to sear the shiro maguro.  I honestly think this fish was on its way to going bad, so they needed to serve it but mask the extra fishy flavor.  Another one that wasn't so appetizing was their super white tuna, which isn't listed on their menu but somehow had it when we asked for it.  It was a little disappointing because the freshness wasn't there.  There were a couple of other nigiri that just didn't cut it to my expectation of freshness, but these two were the most distinct.\n\nI would like to see this business succeed because the ambiance, decor and cleanliness of the restaurant is excellent.  The staff really has potential to excel!  Our server was very accommodating and attentive, but unfortunately the lunch staff in the back couldn't accommodate our large orders. I probably won't be back unless they make some changes to their organization and quality.\n\nP.S. If you're in a bind for choosing your dessert, get the green tea mochi.  It appears to me that it is homemade and you really taste the yummy green tea flavor!  You won't regret it!"
49625,0,Sunday morning isn't a great day for new employees but I'm chill - first nobody made my coolata while my food got cold :/ 2nd when I finally got it - it was melted even though I had just gotten it\nby the time I came home my sammy was all mushy instead of nice & crisp\nThrew it in the broiler for 2 minutes & it completely burnt up :(\nBut why should I have to come home & cook after spending $ on food?!\nPlus the everything bagel I ordered for the other sammy wasn't everything - plain Jane something  I NEVER would've ordered \nDon't let me spend $30 on shit I don't want!\nShame on you dunkin donuts!\nGoing back to Pink Box!
48038,4,The best pizza in Town!! The only pizza my hubby and I will eat!! Friendly staff and owners!!
1369,0,I just paid $20 for two drinks.  This place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous.  The kale isn't fresh it's frozen. The drinks are good but not worth the price. Just juice at home or go to a neighborhood market.
35004,2,"Mediocre at best.  Have been looking forward to come here for a long time and I'm glad I did, because I won't be back.  The oxtail fries were great (hence why they got 3 stars) but the burgers were blah.  The meat was flavorless and is only complimented by the several different ingredients added to the burger.  The pork belly was pretty good but again mediocre because I can get this at Chinatown and it's just as good.  I really wish this place was as good as everyone says, but sorry, it's just not."
17940,4,"I went to Tableau on the recommendation of two friends who had eaten brunch there the previous day - and who wanted our whole group to go back for lunch before we left Vegas.  Vegas has a lot of restaurants (in case you didn't know) so the fact that these two felt strongly about eating at the same spot twice in a three day trip bode well for our meal.\n\nAnd holy moly roly poly.  I'd eat here every day if I could.  First of all, the place is darling.  It feels intimate and the decor is vaguely dollhouse, a great spot for a fancy tea party.  Or brunch, I suppose.  The service - stellar.  The presentation is sweet, with bread in individual tins and hot chocolate served in a fancy pot.  But most important - the food is superb!  \n\nI started with a warm portobello mushroom soup that was poured out of a beautiful little teapot over some little lobster raviolis.  This is one of the best soups I've ever had the pleasure of planting my face in, with deep flavor and that perfect buttony mushroom texture.  After polishing that off like a starved orphan, I moved on to an outstanding steak salad with balsamic, blue cheese, bacon, and more mushrooms.  That was another clean plate.  I finished out the meal (hey, it was my last of the trip, don't judge) with a gorgeous parfait with plenty of berries and lemon custard that was out of this world.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their food as well, and the miscellaneous bites I stole were all fantastic.  I will also mention that the fries are great, and the homemade ketchup (in which you can actually see tiny seeds!) is really several cuts above the bottled stuff.  Definitely give this place a go.  I can't wait to go back."
16029,0,I paid 28.00 dollars for a childs birthday cake that was two thirds frosting not decorated well .MY CAT COULD OF DONE A BETTER JOB. When I went to pay the premium price for all my groceries evidently I got into a line where the cashier was having trouble with some customer that wanted the price that was advertised but the cashier couldn't make it happen he finally just paid for what he had and left. I was promptly informed by the cashier that her light was off because she was trying to solve a problem. I will never go to this rude disorganized crappy excuse for a grocery store ever again. VONS ON DURANGO YOU SUCK!!!!!!
5026,4,"Local love all the way! This place reminds me of home, Hawaii. I think we were served by the owner. He was extremely nice and told us he was from the Big Island.\n\nI've been craving meat jun and boiled peanuts and got a double score when this place had them both! All the appetizers were delicious especially the kim chee. The mandu was also really good. \n\nAfter we put in our order, the table next to us received hot stone dishes with eggs over easy.  Our mouths watered at the sight, since they looked so good. \n\nThe meat jun meat was really tender and had great flavor. Although, I thought it wasn't quite authentic since it had batter plus egg. I've typically had it with just the egg. \n\nMy husband got the spicy noodle soup with beef and vegetables. The noodles had great flavor and the base had the right amount of spicy.\n\nI would have knocked it down to a 4 because of the Meat Jun, but the service was so good that it bumped it back up to a 5. He was even offering otter pops for dessert.\n\nAloha!!"
30671,0,"We ate at this restaurant recently. We were very excited for Cuban food. My wife ordered the Mimita's Minuta or breaded tilapia sandwich. The fish was very old and disgusting. The waitress was very nice and brought her a Tamal Cubano instead. Unfortunately it had all the flavor and consistency of microwaved cheese food. I had the cubano sandwich. The pork too dry and flavorless. Also, the carpeting and booths seemed to be the same as when this location was Rosalee's Italian restaurant over 10 years ago. I will never eat here again."
48020,1,"I liked this hotel; the exterior is appealing to the eye and it stands out. The rooms were decent. We loved gym the gym; there was floor to ceiling windows and just very nice and spacious. The pool was tiny but the floor to ceiling windows make it pleasant. Rent a car if you're staying here; you will need it. It's not conveniently located.\nHowever, the customer service was terrible. First off, they had a security guard wearing his pants below his butt patroling the hallways all day long.  The issue isn't that he looked like a thug, it was his lack of professionalism.  On our first night there, we played music on the iPod dock that is provided in every room. He knocked on our door and told us to lower the music and told us that this was our \""final warning\"". Um, since when is the first warning called a final warning?  He said, \""you only get one warning\"".  Later that night, my brother left the room door slightly open to go get ice on the other side of the floor and the security guard came by again and told us that the door should always remain closed. This is absolutely ridiculous to me.\nAfter this incident, we were never greeted by the front desk folks and they never gave us good restaurant recommendations.  I'm not sure if it was meant to be a joke but they sent us to the crappiest lounge in all of Montreal. They need to re-train their staff here."
38664,0,"Third time is not the charm. Sorry guys but your waitress was rude and sarcastic (and not in a good way either.) I'd love to come into this restaurant and have a friendly vibe but it just isn't happening. Water is not filtered and you can taste it. Hot chocolate was neither sweet nor chocolately. And hey, is it really so hard to put the hollandaise on the side? That's what I asked for but that's not how my benedict came to me. Set in front of me with no apology like I just have to eat it this way or nothing. And that avocado mush - what is that? No flavor added to the bennie at all. Whatever - There won't be any more chances here. Really sorry - I tried to like you."
42838,4,"Trattoria Cinecita is fabulous! When I say the word \""delicious\"" I am not referring exclusively to the food, but rather inclusively to the the way the Manager George Benchimol textured the entire meal with genuine warmth and expert service! As a foodie I would recommend this restaurant to all, but the dining experience was made truly extraordinary by the leadership. Bravo! A real find!"
23367,2,"I like a lot of things about Coffee Bean better than Starbucks - their Ice Blended drinks (way better than Frappucinos), their espresso (a lot richer than Starbucks'), and their powder-based (not syrup) formula for flavored drinks. The employees at this location were really friendly, and the fruit-tea blended I got was really good, although it was a little pricey for a regular size (~$5). However, I'm going to have to dock this location two stars for not having their own wireless network and for having very few plugs for laptops. These days, it's pretty much a given that you should be able to go to a coffee shop, get a beverage, and then sit at a table and surf the net. When I first sat down, I noticed that there were no available plugs - the only outlet was far from my seat and was being monopolized by some 10-year-old kid listening to music on headphones and pounding on his computer keys while his parents sat and conversed at a different table. I guess I'll save my commentaries about modern parenting techniques until another time...\n\nAnyway, after trying to connect and not seeing a Coffee Bean network, I asked the guy behind the counter if they had wireless. He said no, gave some excuse about how they're still trying to set it up (even though they've been open for some time now), and said I could try to get onto Paradise Bakery's network. That's eventually what I did, but the signal was weak since I was in Coffee Bean and not Paradise (no pun intended!). I didn't want to go buy something else there just to have better signal so I stayed put, but I was very disappointed that I had chosen to go there when I had a few hours to kill precisely to relax and go online and that they didn't provide that basic service."
31379,4,"This place is a gem. A rare combination of great coffee and zero pretension. Where most higher-end coffee shops tend to be snobbish, Espresso A Mano is always warm and inviting and the baristas working there are always at the top of their game. No matter how big the line is you will always be served in minutes and your drink will be well made every single time. I rarely take the time to write reviews but this place is worthy of all of the praise it receives. Pay a visit once and I guarantee they will learn your first name and never forget it."
21452,3,"Despite all the recent bad reviews of this place, I actually liked it.  The heat inside isn't THAT bad, people.  Yes, it's warmer than the 75 degrees you keep in your house, but it's not the 110 outside.\n\nI went the other night to see A House Divided (which you would like if you like Chevelle and Breaking Benjamin) and it was ROCKIN'. Sound was pretty good.  I like how it's small enough for the band members to see who is standing in the back and terrorize them.\n\nLadies... one stall in the bathroom.  Be forewarned that there is going to be some drunk chick that will probably go and make a mess in there.  Just plan on not using it as the evening progresses.\n\nAll in all... it's a pretty good experience.  I like that those who aren't drinking get to be up front."
32184,2,"I LOVE BR's clothing for men, but as for me...it's not so much my style. I can't say I've ever owned a piece of their clothing.  \n\nToday brought me in looking for interview attire & oddly enough, one of my boyfriend's friends works there. We told her what we were looking for, but she said they really didn't have anything conservative like I wanted. Instead, she told me to look over at The Limited. :D I was very appreciative of her honesty!\n\nBeing the head parent of the whole BR/Gap/Old Navy family, their prices are pretty steep. I agree with Joe K., the quality of their clothing is very nice.  I will say the sales racks seem to offer pretty good savings, with nice things to choose from."
9377,4,"I love, love, love the Golden Gate!! \u00a0Sadly, I've fallen out of love with the ol' girl's sister property, but that's a different story for a different day.\n\nTHE ROOMS: \u00a0Small. \u00a0Very small. \u00a0Teensie weensie small. \u00a0In some of the rooms, the bathroom door hits the toilet upon entry. \u00a0That having been said: \u00a0As a solo traveler, I couldn't care less about the size of the room. \u00a0For heaven's sake...the hotel was built in 1906!! \u00a0I've stayed at Golden Gate a couple of dozen times in the past 20 years. \u00a0Have always had a pleasant experience.\n*Housekeeping at this property rocks! \u00a0The folks who clean the rooms are either trained very well or they take great pride in what they do. \u00a0Or both.\n*If you get a room facing the Fremont Street Experience, it will be loud. \u00a0Very loud. \u00a0Turn on the tv or your iPod and go to bed at 9 pm if you want. \u00a0\n\nTHE SUITES: \u00a0I like the suites a lot. \u00a0A bit of an odd layout. \u00a0More of a \""shotgun\"" configuration...but no complaints. \u00a0Clean, neat, comfy. \u00a0\n\nTHE GAMING: \u00a0This is a small casino with an alive, vibrant atmosphere. \u00a0Dancing girls on table tops who are also dealers. \u00a0Great, current music. \u00a0A true mix of clientele, from middle aged to 20-something hipsters. \u00a0A very comfortable, relaxed place to game. \u00a0I only play craps and video poker. \u00a0Here's what I can tell you:\n*Craps: \u00a010X odds. \u00a0Let me say that again. \u00a010X odds. \u00a0Not the stoopid 3X4X5X. \u00a0I play a $5 or $10 game. \u00a0Really haven't noticed whether the tables have a lower minimum. \u00a0Dealers are friendly and helpful. \u00a0Tables are fun.\n*Video poker: \u00a0Average pay tables for downtown. \u00a0Not horrible, not full pay. \u00a0The machines at the bar have the same pay tables as the ones on the floor. \u00a0(I hate it when bar VP pays less than floor VP. \u00a0Not the case here.) \u00a0 My biggest gripe is, there are NO multi-line machines to be found at this property. \u00a0The highest denomination is Presbyterian. \u00a0Ok, just kidding. \u00a0Seeing if you're paying attention. \u00a0The highest denomination is $5. \u00a0Wish they'd offer $10 and $25 for that \""once in a blue moon\"" when I'm willing to give it a try. \u00a0Most folks I've noticed play at the 25-cent level.\n*Other: \u00a0There's an area for high limit table games. \u00a0The Golden Gate introduced a new game, Riverboat Roulette, about a month ago. \u00a0The blackjack tables are usually kickin'. \u00a0I really don't play the tables. \u00a0Looks like folks have fun at them.\n\nTHE DINING: \u00a0One option: \u00a0DuPar's. \u00a0Old school. \u00a0I really, really like the food. \u00a0Go healthy if you want. \u00a0Go for the comfort food if you want. \u00a0I highly recommend the soups. \u00a0Oh, and the pies.\n\nTHE BAR: \u00a0The \""Prohibition Bar\"". \u00a0Can't speak to the prices, because I play VP. \u00a0If you're playing video poker, you get free drinks. \u00a0 Absolutely adore the bartenders, especially Curly and Raoul. \u00a0Curly knows more corny jokes than anyone else on the planet. \u00a0There've been times I've gone to Golden Gate just to see him.\n\nTHE OTHER GOO: \u00a0\n\n*The owner, Derek Stevens, hangs out at the bar at least a couple of nights a week. \u00a0I dig the shit out of that. \u00a0Where else does that happen?\n*Sign up for the players club. \u00a0It's pretty generous. \u00a0You earn points while playing that can immediately be converted to freeplay, if you play enough. \u00a0If you churn a bit of scratch, you will also be rewarded with monthly freeplay and a voucher for DuPar's dining. \u00a0And the folks who work at the players club are a hoot!\n*If you are associated with Golden Gate, I must ask that you go away, stop reading, and skip this entry. \u00a0Are you gone? \u00a0Cool. \u00a0There is one unintended bit of entertainment that the Golden Gate offers. \u00a0It's in the women's bathroom. \u00a0The handwashing faucets are set out too far to catch the motion sensor at the base of the spigots. \u00a0This results in moving your hand to trigger the sensor (which triggers the water to come on)...but...by the time you put your hands under the water, the water goes off (because the faucet is too long.) \u00a0HOURS of entertainment watching drunk 20-something girls trying to figure the thing out!! \u00a0Water. \u00a0No water. \u00a0Water. \u00a0No water. \u00a0Cracks me up!!!\n\nListen, I love Las Vegas. \u00a0I love Golden Gate. \u00a0Flaws? \u00a0Sure. \u00a0This is a property whose owner is very much a part of the community, who has introduced some very cool things to downtown (kickboxing, Kid Rock concert, etc.), and who is trying real hard to look for ways to improve things (he bought the old courthouse property, which is currently being worked on, to become...I don't know!)\n\nThe Golden Gate is Old Vegas, baby. \u00a0And it's not sitting around watching the world go by. \u00a0From the build-out of the bar out front, to the owner being visible and readily accessible, this place has positioned itself as part of the community, with an eye toward raising the bar. \u00a0And I dig that."
46741,3,"Love this place, but let's get the prices and days straight.  They are CLOSED on Monday.  Tues-Thurs the lunch buffet is $9.99.  Fri $11.99.  Sat/Sun $12.99.\nI haven't noticed a difference in the food selection on either day, but maybe I'm missing something.  \nFirst thing I like: \nThe have real Basmati white rice.  Tasty.  \nNext:\nThe always have a good selection of soups and dishes on the buffet although lately, haven't seen any goat curry, only fish.\nThe bad:\nUsually I go later, around 2 and the tea is either out or cold.  The paneer can also be gone.  I guess I have to get my act together and get there earlier!"
12774,3,"Great experience. My bf and I stayed at MGM for 2 nights and had a blast! I had stayed at the MGM years ago as a kid and expected the rooms to be outdated, but on the contrary the rooms, gaming floors, and restaurants were very contemporary and exceeded expectations. \n\nMGM has a large pool facility including a lazy river for only guests to use. The pools are  adjacent to the Wet Republic Day Club and while I was using the pool, Steve Aoki was at Wet Republic spinning away. The music could be heard but at a distant level, providing background music to to the area. Once I got up to leave, I walked around the facility which was when I discovered the lazy river. If I did not have dinner plans, I would have definitely tried it out!\n\nHakkasan for my favorite dutch duo, W&W. My bf and I were both on the guestlist but were told that we had to be at the venue by 10PM when the club opens at 10:30PM. We decided to just get tickets which were $20 for female and $30 for male - and these tickets guaranteed our entrance without having to deal with a rowdy crowd to get in. After arriving at around 1:30AM, there was no line at the door and we were in within 2 minutes. The club and decor is pretty standard, the sound system was average, but definitely still a great time. \n\nMGM also has a large gaming space comparatively to newer hotels, which is perhaps one of the aspects to how they maintain their competitive advantage. With a wide variety of gaming tables and slots, I would not hesitate to recommend this place to a friend who enjoyed a good round of blackjack or craps.\n\nThe only con about this hotel is that the location is a bit further from the center of the strip and would require more walking which I am normally fine with. But in 100 degree weather, walking in the heat may become tiresome and exhausting. \n\nI would definitely come back to MGM for another stay and would also recommend this hotel to a friend!"
49172,1,"PAPA - PLEASE WORK ON THE FOOD PREPARATION  AND PORTIONS FOR TO GO ORDERS.  \n\nIt's 8:30 at night and I haven't eaten.  I was excited to try out a new place.  It's open and bright with windows around.  You can see the food being prepared.  I usually order rolled tacos when I visit an eatery like this for the first time.  I figure it would be very hard to mess such a simple thing up.  After all its just meat, rolled in corn tortilla and deep fried until crisp.  Well, it was a bit of a disappointment as only the ends of my tacos were crisp, the insides soft and soggy.  This made me worry that it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  \n\nMy receipt was pushing close to 8 dollars for 6 rolled tacos, rice, and beans and guac. \nI rate the portions of the side dishes - STINGY - not enough for the price tag.  \nI rate the Rolled Tacos D -   Soggy middles - yuck. \nI rate the guacamole A+  - It's the real deal, not the watered down stuff.  Very good.  \nI rate the beans A+ - flavorful and wonderful.\nI rate the rice   C-  as mine was on the undercooked side, slightly crunchy, yuck though it seemed to have a good flavor. \nI rate the Salsa - B - it was average, expected salsa for this type of venue \nI rate the restaurant ambiance A+\nI rate the service A+ \nI rate the cooks - well, they leave more to be expected.  Please work on it Papa Chevos, you have time because I won't be back anytime soon.  Maybe I will try again after some more weeks pass."
11328,0,Fuck this place. Showed up with 50+ people for one of our hammer & cycle bike rides and the bartender said we were being too loud and running off her customers. We were all paying customers and were not even loud to the 5 other people that were there. Fuck that place you just lost the best night you probably every had!!!!
5656,0,"Swankier than I remember in the past and that was a complete surprise! We had some time to kill and seeing that we are usually someplace mid strip, we were staying at MGM this time and decided to take a stroll over to Hooters just to appease my curiousity. It really hasn't changed much but it appears they got a new coat of paint and some new carpet. Gambling there is cheap....the drinks are waaaay cheaper than at the \""nicer\"" casinos so I can't really complain. It's a bit out of the way but if you like their wings (which I don't) they have $0.25 wings every day after 10 pm.  I wouldn't stay here but if you are looking for a cheap alternative and the Imperial Palace isn't your cup of tea on the strip you can stay at Hooters for less than $20 a night. Unfortunately, it makes my stomach turn just thinking about it."

25248,2,"The first part of my little Montreal jaunt was for work, and this is our company's negotiated hotel.  So though I would have preferred something more exciting, the Quality it was.  \n\nAt first glance, I was dubious.  The hotel decor is extremely dated and shabby and the hotel itself is in a not so great area.  I got up to my room and did my standard inspection/strip down of the beds (I've become a total paranoid freak about bedbugs.  Don't judge.) and I have to give the hotel credit, everything is immaculate.  The rooms are scrupulously clean.  Overall, the hotel is totally serviceable and totally unexceptional.  I will say the staff was very nice and provided us with some pretty good restaurant recommendations within walking distance.  \n\nI would caution you to avoid the hotel restaurant, \""Graffiti's\"" at all costs.  We had breakfast there every morning (I was advocating for Tim Horton's, but lost out to my coworker who had the car.  Hmph.) which was standard issue, overpriced hotel stuff.  Car-having coworker also subjected me to dinner there one night and it was horrendous.  I had a feeling, based on breakfast, that dinner would be less than great so I ordered a pizza, figuring that'd be hard to screw up.  No dice, it was so awful I couldn't finish it.  AND I think it was something like $14.  Thank goodness that meal's going on the expense report..."
37984,0,"**BUYER BEWARE** MARQUEE WILL SCAM YOU!!!!!\n\nReed Reygadas, I hope you read this! The VIP host staff CANNOT be trusted. \n\nI had been in contact with the Marquee VIP host staff, specifically Reed Reygadas (a senior VIP host), about planning for a INDOOR table at Marquee last Friday for my bachelor party. This was to be one of the most epic nights of my life. I had spent a few other nights at Marquee and knew the potential party they could throw. Reed had verified that I had a reservation for an INDOOR table that evening for my group. I had been in contact with Reed several times during the day via text message.\n\nWhen I arrived, the host assigned to us informed us that we would be moved out to the outdoor cabanas at the same price as an indoor cabana. The temperature had dropped to about 55 degrees and there were 30 mph winds outside due to the changing weather and location of the club on top of the building. This is obviously totally unacceptable. \n\nThey then offered to drop the price slightly... I told them that there was no price in which I would take a table that was in the middle of a hurricane. They told me that I had to decide whether to take the table or not in 2 minutes or we would be asked to leave. They informed me that they could not offer to let us stay in the club, despite them changing things on us. \n\nTheir rationale for the change was that all tables are based on demand. Then WHAT THE F IS A RESERVATION FOR!?!?!? \n\nThere was no mention of tables being subject to change before arrival, only after we had entered the club. Not even an indication that things might change via text message during the day when I had communicated with Mr. Reygadas. This was clearly a case of people with outside cabanas wanting to move indoors and willing to pay top dollar to do so. We were not even given the opportunity to pay more for an indoor table (I wouldn't have). \n\nAfter much arguing, they approved to let us stay in the club but would charge us $50 cover per person. \n\nThese individuals completely ruined my huge, once in a lifetime evening because of their greed and shady practices.\n\nOH AND ONE MORE THING. I had just got done spending well over $2000 at their sister club, Tao, the evening before. And this is how they treat me? \n\nAll in all, my friends and I have probably spent in excess of $20k at the Marquee and Tao establishments. \n\nThis is how they treat people. \n\nDO NOT MAKE ANY PLANS THAT RELY ON THE VIP STAFF AT MARQUEE NIGHT CLUB. \n\nThank you for ruining my trip, Mr. Greed Reygadas... this was the worst experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. You all should be ashamed of yourselves for undertaking such deceptive practices. You all are grossing plenty of revenue every single night... you don't need to take advantage of people who are ready and willing to spend ungodly amounts of money at your establishment. \n\nI can assure you that you have lost plenty of future business from me. I cannot have that night back and there is nothing you can do to give it back to me. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves.\n\nIf any of you reading this review have any self respect, do not give your money to these greedy heartless individuals."

26288,0,"This was my first time at Nothing But Noodles and it will probably be my last. The problem was, I entered the establishment craving Pho. Now I was smart enough to know I wasn't going to actually be able to order Pho but I certainly thought what I did order was going to taste better than it actually did.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered the Spicy Japanese noodles with shrimp. Per the menu, the dish came with spicy noodles and an abundance of broccoli (take a look at my picture that I posted. Do you see an abundance of broccoli?) The noodles were like no other noodle I have ever seen. It was spaghetti on steroids. It was the Arnold Schwarzenegger of Spaghetti and they were gummy. Gag! The shrimp were very tiny and the sauce was so spicy, you couldn't taste anything else. Don't get me wrong I love spicy food but when the spice is all you can taste, it ruins the entire dish.\n\nThe place was crazy busy and loud and the table we sat at was sticky. I don't even want to know what went on at that table before we sat down. Images of toddlers smearing half chewed pasta into the table with the ball of their hands kept flashing before my eyes.\n\nThe only positive, the food came out quick."

43418,4,"Sweet Addiction has done something amazing here -- they managed to scoop up the nostalgia of Thrifty ice cream, smother it between some freshly-baked cookies, and smack me in the face with deliciousness.\n\nThe folks here weren't kidding around with their store name. There has to be something around here to satisfy even the sweetest of tooths. They have a variety of items here, including something more unique: frozen hot chocolate. However, for my initial visit, I had to try their signature cookie ice cream sandwich.\n\nI went with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with some oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookies literally just came out of the oven. They were warm, soft, and wrapped around the ice cream nicely. The ice cream slowly fused with the cookie as it slowly began to melt. Combining these two powers seemed unreal. I was expecting Captain Planet to come around at any second.\n\nI took a bite and was floored by shock. This was delicious.\n\nIt's not often that I'm excited about a new place, but an amazing staff, coupled along with an extremely reasonably priced (and delicious) menu is enough to keep me coming back for more.\n\nPro-tip: Check to see if any cookies just came out of the oven. Those go so well with the ice cream."
38845,1,"The patio has a nice vibe and we were seated. Craft beer and extensive wine list was yum. The menu though..really needs work.  Beet salad. fried veggies and calamari, salmon with lentils, chicken ala boring. The menu was just so...limited.  If we were not famished we would have looked for another place, but the valet had already parked us.  Complimentary valet service was nice. I ordered a vegetarian black bean burger. It came with fries, but I substituted for fruit. The fruit bowl was huge, but the fruit was day-old melon.  My friend had a boring chicken sandwich. Grilled and tossed across a bun..just blah.  We were confused on wait staff-who was serving us? Three people came by. They were confused with fetching a little ketchup for me to try and spice up the bean burger.  The bean burger was dry and arrived with no sauce or toppings except lettuce and tomato.  We ate just to eat,  tipped and were left with a feeling..nice place for a nice drink and a chat if you are near The Westin, but other than that...prepare to be bored."
9468,0,"Golden Nugget deserves 1 star when you have to pull a couch cushion off of the sofa to put in the bathroom to get some peace and quiet sleep.  I'm not proud of it and it's a first for me, but sleeping in the bathroom was about the only place I could get some rest.  Had the front desk only informed me that the music and noise coming from Fremont Street Experience was so loud that it penetrates the walls of the Rush Tower hotel rooms facing it, I would have elected to go on the opposite side of the tower.  I was here on business, not by choice, and got the short end of the stick.  People staying here be warned: if you are in the new Rush Tower facing  Fremont Street, the music plays full volume until 3:00am and literally penetrates the windows and walls.  Putting your hand against either of them will reveal the pulsating beats and low-end frequencies of the music being blasted from 100 feet away.  I'm not being elderly about it- I'm in my 30's and enjoy loud concerts....just not when I'm trying to sleep.  \n\nI was compensated 1 night free for my troubles (stayed a total of 2 nights).  I'll say that the rooms in the new Rush Tower are nice and hold their own against any of the newer 3 star hotels on the Vegas Strip.  But what good is a nice room if you can't enjoy it?\n\nCustomer service was the worst experience I have ever had at any hotel.  When I called at midnight willing to change my room for another, nobody at the hotel was willing to help.  I complained that I was never given a notice about how much noise would be pushing through the wall and it was only met with a mere \""well, this is Vegas and the city never sleeps\"" attitude.  I call B.S..  I've stayed in most of the major hotels lining the strip and have never had an issue with outside noise.  The next day the manager on duty, Orion, told me and my group of 20 business administrators that \""he would not\"" allow us to speak to the General Manager, Brett, because he did not want to bother the GM with an issue like this.  I really can't believe that the words out of his mouth were \""I will not do that for you.\""  Nice customer service.  He said that in front of a large group of us at the front desk.  This is what we in the business world say should be a \""never event.\""  As in, me and my group of 20 administrators will never be back to the Golden Nugget based on the poor customer service.  I hope Brett puts a check on the attitudes of the managers because it makes the hotel experience awful and reflects poorly on the hotel management.  \n\nMy 2nd night they conveniently found me a room facing the opposite way as Fremont Street.  At night it was peaceful, quiet, and the way it should be.  \n\nThanks for comping me one night, though. It was my company's money and at least Orion admitted that my guest experience was not acceptable.  I told him to pass on to Brett that the Golden Nugget should start giving a disclaimer to all guests to warn them about the excessive noise that comes through the wall.  He said that it was \""a great idea\"" and I'm sure that he was lying.  I bet he never brought it up again.  The fact is that the Golden Nugget is just not a guest friendly hotel at this time.  Maybe a change in staff attitude would help put the bow on an otherwise pretty package."

I call the dealership and he assured me that it sometimes happens and sensors get messed up. I took his word and continued on with my day. After a week of working & school the light continued to come on and off . Then my water pressure light came on so I figured I would buy some windshield wiper liquid. As I go to pump my hood I was mortified. The cap to my oil component was off and set aside. Oil had spewed all over everything you could think of under the hood. I was appalled and angry. I immediately went in and had them fix the issue, which they did. They claimed they did a full service oil change, but here I am again not even 3000 miles in and I need another oil change.

46265,1,The food was just good. Nothing I would write home about. I found a few things that I thought was weird. The first thing is they charge for refills. Really what is the cost to do refills. Second thing as sitting there eating my food some more people came in and them like me was their first visit. They had 9 people in their party. The lady behind the counter said that they 15 percent gratuity. How do you charge this when you have to order at the counter and they don't have to bring you refills of food or drink. \nOn the positive side the people were friendly.

I was up playing poker until 6:00am and was up around 10:00am so I was pretty tired and too lazy to walk/drive anywhere to eat.  I always see a long line whenever I walk by the buffet.  I just thought the food must be OK.  Boy was I wrong!!!  \n\nWe didn't have to wait at all since we were able to go through Diamond entrance.  The cashier and host were very nice, so no complains here.    Long long time ago when Paris first opened, we did dine here once.  I could not recall my experience but I am sure it wasn't bad enough for me to remember it.  \n\nThe host led us to our table and took our drink orders.  She said to go ahead to the buffet and our server would get our drinks.  Well, when we returned to our table after getting our food, the drinks were not there.  When the waitress finally showed up, she had to ask what we wanted to drink again!  After she got our drinks, we hardly saw her again.  She was more interested in cleaning up tables than serving tables.  Maybe she should have taken a job as a bus girl instead of a server.  I had to flag her down a couple of times to get crab cracker (not sure if this is what it is called) and wet towelette.  She never came by to check if we needed refill or anything.  \n\nAnd the food was the worst buffet I have ever seen.  The selections were very minimal.  The only thing good was the omelet from the omelet station, but who can mess up on omelet!  The crab legs were OK.  The crepe was bleh.  I also got a thin cut of what I thought was roast beef, but I am pretty sure I got lamb.  I don't eat lamb and I know the smell of lamb.  I couldn't tell until I sat down on the table and smelled the 'funny smell'.  I couldn't even take a bite.  I am really upset the lady mistaken the lamb for beef!  \n\nI walked around trying to find something else to eat but nothing really looked appetizing.  I settled for a small bowl of salad.  I figured I could just get some dessert to make me happy.  When I walk around the dessert 'house', the place looked deserted!  There was nobody attending the dessert house!  There was no cookies, no cakes, just a few pieces of pies, and a soft-serve station.  I was a few fruit tarts inside but I couldn't get to them!  What the hell happened?  This is Paris!!!!  It's supposed to have good pastries, right?  \n\nBoth my fiance and I left in great disappointment.  And I am really upset I wasted $50 from my comp credit for this sh!%ty buffet!  My fiance filled out the survey card, but I am sure it'd just be thrown to the trash can.  \n\nOn my way out, I really wanted to tell all the people that were still waiting in line to 'run'.  There are plenty of other places to eat buffet.  Don't be lazy like me, because you'd pay for it like me and hate yourself afterwards!"
21068,4,"I love coffee. I love coffee shops. My secret dream (not so secret now) is to one day have a coffee shop of my own. The Coffee Shop, across from the Agritopia gardens and Joe's Farm Grill, is what I aspire to. \n\nThe coffee selection is vast and everything I've had tastes delicious. And if you, dear reader, do not like coffee and feel that one cup of coffee is indistinguishable from another then you would be very wrong.  Some establishments are very capable of making bad coffee. However, and thankfully, not The Coffee Shop. \n\nWhile I'm not the biggest fan of sweets I would still recommend partaking in one of the beautiful cupcakes offered here. Did I mention they are award-winning? Cupcake creators, Jessica Cuff and Jenna Flowers (sisters), won Cupcake Wars. \n\nI'm a creature of habit and so you'll find me sitting in one of the retro couches with my laptop, sipping a Spanish Latte and noshing down on a Tomato Basil sandwich (Mozzarella, mayo, tomato, basil, onion, avocado, feta, and Italian dressing on 9 grain bread)."

There are a few very good restaurants located in the casino, as well as a bowling alley and a movie theater. The pool area is very nice, and the rooms are beautiful. Another bonus ... Red Rock Canyon is a hop, skip and a jump away. Great sightseeing if you didn't come here to black out the entire time."
